He  worked  towards  his  father  and  mother  wish  for  him  becoming  a  trained  seaman  with  the  Nigeria  navy.  His  zeal  was  to  go  as  far  on  seas  in  campaigning  against  crude  oil  theft,  illegal  oil  bunkering,  pipeline  vandalism,  sea  piracy,  fish  poaching,  sea  murder  and  other  illicit  sea  activities.  Somehow,  he  got  his  full    happiness  of  his  life.
                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                

                                                                               











                                                                               
                                                                                CHAPTER   ONE
THE  LAIR  present  in  a  quadruple  figure  with  an  open  space  littered  with  grosses  of  animals  voicing  out  noises.  The  pall  environment  was  never  humane  as  the  air  was  filled  with  putrid  odour.  Sitting  in  the  midst  of  these  animals  was  a  big  spat  on  my  face  as  the  smell  kept streaming.  My  indecision  was  obstructed  by  conversations  as  I  sat  with  surprise.  I  bent  my  head.       “Young  man  are  you  okay?”  The  cold  voice  cut  my  anger.  Raising  my  head  was  another  thing entirely  as  I  can  clearly  see  two  legs  standing  right  at  me  with  a  sling  walking  stick.  “Water!” “Young  man  it  seems  you  are  tired”, he  said  while  nodding  his  small  head.   The  pant  I  exhibited due  to  tiredness  was  of  pseudo.  The  tall  old  man  with  his  tall  walking  stick  can  be  easily  identified  by  his  hoary-hair.  His  scary  face  present  a  sour  look  like  a  pinched  taste  of  salt.           “Do  you  feel  like  eating  something?”  “No.  I  need  water  first.”  He  quickly  ordered  for  a  bowl  of water  from  his  friend  who  was  quick  in  response.  “Take  this  I  know  you  will  be  okay.”  “Thank  you  sir.” The  water  was  chilled  as  it  was  finding  its  way  to  my  dry  throat.  “I  am  fully  okay  sir.”      “My  son  anything  again?”  “Yes  sir.  I’m  in  need  of  a  job.”  “Job?”  He  burst  into  a  thunderous  laugh.  “Can  you  really  do  the  job  I  consider  good  for  you?”  “why  not  sir.  I  can  do  any  job  that  comes.”  “Hurry  up  and  follow  me”,  he  says.  My  crack  ribs  became  upright  as  I  am  about achieving  my  aim.  We  both  walk  in  haste;  getting  to  the  cornered  hamlet  was  long  from  the onset.  The  old  man  unfriendly  look  gradually  in  a  massive  sweat  due  to  the  journey.  He  paused  and  inquired  to  know  my  name.  “I’m  Paul.”  He  briskly  nodded  his  head.  “Now  Paul.  Can  you work  in  a  Pen?”  “Pen?”  “but  you  said  you  can  do  any  job?”  “really...  sir.”  “Well  Paul:  let  us walk  faster.”  He  never  care  that  he  is  ageing  as  his  legs  were  faster  than  expected.  “We  are  almost  getting  there—Paul.”  Staring  at  the  dirty  pen;  my  heart  beat  massively.  “So  Paul  can  you see  that  pen  over  there?”  “Yes  sir.”  “That  is  your  place  of  duty  from  today.”  “Okay  sir.  Your  name  sir?”  the  old  man  walk  straight  to  his  hut.  The  wood  pen  was  scary  indeed  with  little wood  raining  on  me.  “How  comes?”  The  question  flowing  out  of  my  mind.  The  nylon  on  the  floor  where  swine  were  sleeping  was  really  hurtful  as  I  suggest  it  must  be  good  for  covering  the  crack  wall.  The  mire  floor  was  porous.  I  was  too  tired  and  lonely  in  the  abode  I  have  not  determine.  “No  father  and  mother  to  come  to  my  aid.  What  do  I  do  to  save  myself  from  this dying  situation?  am  really  hungry!”  Resting  without  food  in  my  stomach  that  was  rumbling  was  so  challenging.  “Who  do  I  run  to?  Oh  God  help  me  from  my  travails!  I  am  willing  to  hear  from  you!”  herd-of-swine  sniffing  their  short  narrow  noses  to  my  discouraging  body.  I  never  paid  much  attention  to  them  since  I  was  too  hungry  and  in  need  of  a  good  rest.  From  above  the  gleam  stars  signals  the  day  is  becoming  darker.  My  palpitating  mood  was  surrounded with  screeches  noise  closer  to  me.  The  pen  was  unpleasant  and  serving  as  a  transit  for  any  escape  from  the  herd-of-swine.  The  walls  was  covered  with  wet  nylon  I  attached  with  mud.  “Oh!:  am  I  going  to  die  here?  May  be  yes  or  maybe  no.  But  I  can  still  survive  only  if  this situation  will  be  temporal.”  Whirr  of  wings  flying  atop  the  leaking  roof  slamming  everywhere  covering  me.                 “I  know  this  will  linger  for  a  while.  I  am  ready  to  fight  these  to  the  end.  You  evil  bird  go  away. Please  don’t  disturb  me!”  The  birds  were  approaching  the  roof  with  more  circuitous manner.  Their  leisure  was  disturbing.  Suddenly  they  flew  away  and  calmness  came.                                                                                                                                                                                         The  quiet  seconds  was  dramatic  with  a  fist  and  bang.  Silently  the  door  was  making  some  noisy vibration  minute  by  minute  as  the  room  was  eager  to  know  the  unknown.*                                   
“Who  might  this   be?”  lurking  footsteps  was  waiting  for  the  door  to  be  flung  open  in  a  murky   atmosphere.  “I  demand  to  know  your  name?”  “Jerry.”  “Who  is  Jerry?”  “Don’t  be  scared.  It’s  your  master.”  “Oh!  Am  sorry.”  The  rush  was  quick.  Opening  the  door  was  tedious  as  it  was  locked  from outside.  “The  key  master?”  “Paul  look  around  and  you  will  find  a  spare  key  hung  on  one  of  the swine  body.”  “Which  one  actually?  Okay!  Okay!  I  can  see  it.  Come  my  friend.  I  need  that  which  is  hanging  around  your  neck.  Easy  am  here.  Yes  I  have  done  it!  Master  are  you  still  there?”  “Yes  I  am  still  waiting  for  you.”  “Hold  on,  master!  I  am  doing  everything  I  can  sir!  The  lock  is  stiffed.”  “Paul  I  will  unlock  the  door  from  outside!”  “You  mean?”  in  a  jiffy,  the  small doorway  was  welcoming  with  rags  thrown  to  the  direction  of  the  mud  floor.  “Thanks  master.      A  thousand  blessing  must  await  him  I  know  that!”  Crying  wind  forcing  the  door  to  close.    Normal  thick  night  was  ever  busy  with  its  shiny  stars.  “I  still  need  some  food  how  do  I  get  it now?”  A  grating  voice  maximizing  in  the  dark  as  I  became  motionless.  Sharp  bright  light  radiating  from  the  moon  was  really  helpful  as  it  pierced  the  holes  of  the  old  roof.  This  was  quite  helpful  in  locating  the  little  food  in  the  room.  The  herd-of-swine  really  enjoying  the  slum  near  the  mud.  It  shows  they  were  hungry  by  the  way  they  are  rushing  to  tear  the  torn  nylon  on  the  floor.  The  food  we  were  struggling  for  was  in  a  plate  which  was  stale.  Inside  the  plate  there  lay  hot  faeces  which  was  interesting  to  eat  since  there  was  no  option  of  any  food  to  eat.  From  far  hooting  of  the  owl  deterred  me  from  sleeping  as  if  presentiment.  “This  new  abode  will  be   manage  pro tempore.”  Footstep  of  a  prowler  was  zooming  as  the  storm  utter  a  howl.  Fast  slim  lightning  above  the  earth  as  presage  to  an  heavy  rain.  Cold  enough  to  shatter  the  spine  was  within  the  vicinity.  No  blanket  to  cover  my  body  from  cold.  The  grunting  from  the  swine  was  disturbing  as  they  were  sleeping.  It  rained  heavily  in  a  fountain  way.  Still  the  wind  was  never  hush  as  the  hoarse  voice  was  heard   in  the  dark.  The  rain  waggled.  My  digested  food  was  satisfactory as  I  wink  due  to  tiredness.  Fruitful  sleep  was  on  its  course  as  it  led  to  a  dream.  Two  muscular  men  burgled  into  where  I  was  and  held  me  tight  as  they  chastised  me.  Any  help  that  might  occurred  will  be  prevented  by  the  rain.  Their  ambidextrous  seems  they  were  wrestlers  who  want  to  test  how  prowess  I  am.  I  forced  out  resistance  to  the  kidnappers  who  kept  trying  to  overcome   me.  Finally  I  was  lifted  to  the  huge  waiting  van.  Yet  again,  the  heavy  downpour  was  horrendous.  “HELP!”  No  one  was  in  the  mood  to  come  out.  Sitting  inside  the  open  space  of  the  van  was  pleasant  as  there  were  a  lot  to  see.  “Mama!”  “Are  you  out  of  your  senses?  don’t  you  see  we  are  held ... captive?”  “Is  just  that  everyone  is  cruel—around  me!”                                                 “So  you  mean  it?”                                                                                                                                                                                                   “Yes  of  course.”                                                                                                                                                                                                       “Like  how?”                                                                                                                                                                                                         “I  remember  when  I  was  working  as  a  carpenter:  my  master  always  make  money  out  of  me  due  to  my  talent  but  still  I  receive  pittance  every  day.”                                                                                                                          “Your  case  is  not  as  bad  like  mine.                                                                                                                                                                So ...  what  is  your  name?”  “Okoh.”                                                                                                                                                                    “How  on  earth  will  someone  with  such  a  wonderful  name  refuse  to  be  smart?                                                                                                   Nevertheless,  Paul  is  by  your  side.”  “So  that  is  your  name?”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                               

“Yes.”  “So  how  did  you  end  up  being  here  Paul?”  “It’s  really  a  long  story  but  I  can  give  you  a  glimpse  of  the  whole  story.  I  was  employed  as  a  worker  in  a  remote  area.”  “Like?”  “I  mean  in  the  slum.”  “To  do  what?”  “To  feed  the  herd-of-swine.”  “What?”  “Really  Okoh!  Mother  always  advice  me  to  be  a  man  if  circumstances  arise  with  no  help.”  “How  about  your  father?”  “He  is  in  the  horn  of  Africa  doing  what  he  likes  doing—searching  for  job  for  the  sake  of  his  family.”  “Which  country  is  he?”  “Somalia.”  “I  hope  he  doesn’t  find  it  difficult  there.”  “Is  just  that  I  haven’t  heard  from  him  since.”  “You  mean?”  “I  am  saying  that  we  lost  contact  then  I  was  a  kid.”  “So  you  must  have  been  working  towards  meeting  him.”  “Like  you  say.”  “Paul  where  is   our  captors  taking  us  to?”  “I  should  be  asking  you—Okoh.”  “I  guess  we  are  heading  for  doom. We  should  better  plan  how  to  escape  from  this  place  now.”  “Quiet!”  The  moving  van  suddenly  stops  as  everybody  was  scared  to  their  feet.  Grisly  look  on  the  kidnappers  was  strange  as  they  were  fully  ready  for  business.  “Who  goes  first?”  His  wide  mouth  bursting  out  massive  saliva  like  a  bulldog.  His  wrinkle  body  was  enticing  to  flies.  Guns  stashed  to  break  any  plan  of  escaping.  “So?”  blotch  teeth  was  passing  us  from  the  kidnapper.  Still  perplexed  over  the  experience  our   instinct  couldn’t  foretold  us  of  this  predicament.  We  are  all  faced  with  death  or  anything  that  might  come  short  of  our  memory.  Hunting  for  a  decent  job  has  speak  volume  of  itself.  “You  two  follow  me.”  My  heart  faint  as  our  partners  whose  names  were  unknown  to  us  alight  the   van  and  all  we  could  heard  was  gunshot.  “Okoh  can  you  here  that?”  “Yes.  Lucky  to  be  alive Paul.”  The  van  press  on  sluggishly.  “I  feel  relief  Okoh.”  “I  too  Paul. Let  us  get  set  Paul.  Can  you  see?”  “What?  Opening  door!  It  must  be  that  dangerous  man;  He  must  be  planning  evil  against  us.”  “Silent!  don’t  talk.  Be  quiet.”  “So  you  idiot  boys  has  the  right  to  speak!  I  will  show  you  the  other  side  of  me!”  “No  ... We  are  only  chatting.”  The  gigantic  club  on  his  hand  was  shaking  with  speed.  “You  what  is  your  name?”  “Okoh.”  “Follow  me  Okoh.”  “Have  mercy  on  him!”  “Paul  please  don’t  leave  me  alone!”  Stylish  door  of  the  van  shut.  Inside  the  van  a  gloomy  state  ran  over  me.  “HELP!  I  don’t  want  to  die!  My  mother  needs  me  more!  Consider  me!  Open  the  door  I  have  something  to  tell  you!  Just  believe  me!”  My  knuckle  was  hitting  the  van.  I  was  crying.                                                                                                                                                                                              The  van  was  setting  to  stop.  Suddenly  the  van  door  opens.  “Get  down!” The  harsh  word  flushed.  Getting  down  was  difficult  as  the  entire  environment  was  strange. My  eyes  tied  and  my  direction  was  unknown.  All  I  could  feel  was  that  I  am  in  a  dungeon.  Above  me  was  noisy.  Smelling  urine  spreading  faster  on  my  head.  My  feet  move  restless  faster.  I  untied  my  eyes.  Redolent  blood  was  on  the  body  of  a  dead  creature.  “HELLO!”  No  response  from  anyone.  Rough  night  changing  to  morning.  In  the  dungeon  I  could  see  what  I  was  standing  on.  “It  is  a  skeleton.  HELP!!  Is  someone  there  to  carry  me  out  from  this  place?  Whoa!  It  was  a  dream.  How  can  I  be  dreaming such?  This  is  so  serious.  Imagine  that.”  Heavy  litres  of  water  was  poured  on  my  body  as  my  master  has  given  his  boys  authority.  “I  was  too  tired  sir!”  mopping  my  brow  was  difficult  as  my  master’s  boys  gathered  me. Each  of  them  were  giving  me  hurling blows.  They  look  adept  by  their  scud  punches.  “You  people  are  callous!”  “Paul  your  stupidity  is  so  much!  Sleeping  till  this  time.”                                                                                                                                                                                Everyone  are  merciless  merely  looking  at  them.  Walking  forward  with  pains  in  his  eyes  was  the  master  himself— Jerry.  He  will  decline  to  trade  his  herd-of-swine  for   anything  else.  “Forgive  me  sir.”  “I  thought  you  are  bold  enough  to  take  care  of  my  swine.  You  are  finished,  hence,  I  will  deal  with  you.  I  will  show  you  who  I  am!  open  your  ears  very  well  and  listen  to  me.  Hmmm.  One  step  and  after  that  death  is  certain  if  I  can’t  see  my  beloved  swine  I  cherished  more  than  you.  I  employed  you  barbarian  to  feed  all  my  precious  swine. You  slept,  now  they  have  escaped.                                                             Where  are  my  swine?”  “Oh,  they  have  escaped!  I  will  check  everywhere  I  can.”  “Foolish  boy!” Interesting  vicinity  was  in  total  still.  My  partners  of  concern  ready  to  help  me.  “Master  we’ll  join  him  to  search  for  the  swine.”  “Listen  to  me  boys  it  must  be  good  news.”  “Yes  master!”  “Master  Jerry  has  a  waspish  way  of  handling  issues.”  “Really?”  The  person  speaking  to  me  was   someone  I  never  knew  his  name.  “I  am  David.  Don’t  worry  we’ll  assist  you.  Guys  we  need  to   save  our  pal!”  David  was  more  open  than  the  rest.  “That  is  Atinko,  Barak,  they  will  also  assist   us  Paul.”  “How  did  you  knew  my  name?”  “Master  Jerry  told  me.  We  need  to  divest  for  us  to  be  successful  in  catching  all  the  swine.”  David  dumpy  height  can  be  obstacle;  I  was  baffled  on  how  fast  would  he  to  make  a  catch.  We  move  steadily  round  the  swamp  closer  to  the  pen.   Weed-out  reeds  on  the  surface  of  water  was  smelling.  We  move  ditto  as  a  way  of  laying  an  ambush.  The  wet  bare  ground  was  difficult  to  walk  on.  All  the  swine  were  directed  back  to  the  pen.  Our  team-work  and  perseverance  was  a  success.  “Thank  you  everyone!  I  appreciate  your  kind  concern,”  I  expressed.  Lilting  and  jubilation  was  heard  everywhere,  even  the  bushy  environs  can   feel  the  ecstasy.  “Paul  let’s  go  and  sit  at  that  cement  bench  over  there  so  as  to  acquaint  you   of  our  way  of  life  in  these  place.  We  usually  go  and  harvest  some  potatoes  on  the  farm.  That’s  the  only  food  to  eat  here.”  “Who  planted  it?”  I  asked.  “Me  of  course!”  “David  you   mean  it?”  “never  doubt  me  Paul;  I  know  Paul:  this  specific  point  in  time  you  shall  also  join   our  team.  Glad  being  with  you.”  “Eating  only  potatoes  every  day!  Is  there  no  other   way  we  can  eat  another  food?”  “No  other  way.”  “I  can’t  still  believe  this.  Imagine?”  “that  is  how  we have  been  surviving  Paul.”  David  was  fast  to  rescue  his  concealed  sorrow.  “What  of  if  I  decide  not  going  to  the  farm?”  “then  I  can  say  you  are  preparing  to  die  of  hunger.  Paul  start  deciding  for  yourself  before  is  too  late.  So  ...  Paul  be  careful  with  the  master’s  boy—Atinko.”  My  mind  cut-off  as  the  information  was  passed  to  my  ear.  “Thanks  David  for  that,” I   said.  Barak  who  was  tired  as  a  result  of  hectic  work  sat  speechless,  wept  as  he  could  not  remember  when   last  he  had  seen  his  parents.  He  walk  straight  to  us  and  inform  us  of  how  sad  he  was  since  his  uncle  took  him  away  from  his  parents  and  maltreated  him.  “My  uncle,”  said  Barak,  “had  caused  many  harm  to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 people  all  because  of  a  plot  of  land  he  has  been  battling  from  the  village  clan.  Wicked  as  he  is;                                                                                                                                                                   he  only  trust  himself  and  no  one  else  that  is  the  reason  of  his  wickedness.”  “But  Barak:  why  would   a  human  being  presume  to  do  evil  in  his  mind?”  “Really  unfortunate  as  it  is.  Now  we   have  to  think  of  how  to  escape  before  we  die  of  stress.  A  mission,”  said  Barak,  “You  can  see   Atinko  coming  like  a  mad  man.  I  am  sure  Master  Jerry  has  sent  him  to  the  forest  to  get  some                                                                                                                                                                                            firewood  for  him.”  “How  did  you  know?”  “we  all  know  the  way  a  man  going  to  the  forest  looks.  You  can  see  his  pouch  hung  to  his  shoulder.”  “Paul!”  screamed  Atinko.  “Let  us  go  to  the  forest!”  Atinko  ordered.  “Forest?”  “Yes.”  “Atinko  give  me  more  time ... please!”  “hasten  up  as   you  can  see  we  are  short  of  time.”  “Just  now?”  “yes  Paul!  We  will  be  on  a  donkey  soonest.”         To  me  this  was  the  best  chance  of  vanishing.  Only  David  and  Barak  would  understand  my  plan.    “Climb  the  donkey  Paul  and  let  us  go!”  I  climb  and  sat.  The  ride  to  the  forest  was  enjoyable.                                       I  blew  out  my  cheeks  as  the  air  welcome  us  to  the  route  I  can’t  stop  gazing  at.  I  was  hungry  deep  in  me.  My  eyeballs  were  weak  to  see  further.  First  timers  if  not  careful  will  lost  their  way  home.  hunters  is  not  seen  parading  themselves  everywhere.  “Mother!  You  can  save  me.”                                                   “You  are  scaring  me  Paul.”  “Okay  I  promise  to  be  quiet.”  “That  will  be  good  of  you  if  you  can.”                              Donkey  we  sat  on  running  speedily.  I  calmed  down  fear  that  almost  led  to  a  determination  to  stop.  “Hurray!  We  have  escaped.  Jerry  would  faint  if  he  noticed  it.  We’re  not  slaves  anymore!”                                                               
Riding  on  the  unsmooth  road  of  the  forest  which  is  rife with  an  afro-haircut  was  an  herculean task.  “I  know  this  might  be  the  first  time  of  you  been  on  a  donkey.”  “You  got  that  right,  Atinko.”  “Different  colours  of  birds  flying;  nice  to  see  the  wonders  of  the  glade!”  “I  can’t  remember  if  my  father  has  brought  me  to  the  forest  to  see  animals.”  “It  seems  animals  are  something  you  love  seeing—Paul!”  “My  father  was  an  hunter;  he  inherited  his  rifle  from  his  father  when  he  was  young.”  “Good  to  hear  that,  Paul.”  Soggy  ground  fizz  as  the  donkey  was  walking.  “Parrot!”  “where  Atinko?”  “on  the  baobab  tree.”  “I  can  see  it!”  “monkeys  also  hopping  on  tree!  Paul  can  we  get  down?”  “I  should  be  the  first  if  you  delay.”  “Wait  for  me  Paul!”    “very  soon  the  parrot  will  hide;  I  hate  climbing  trees  besides  my  mother  has  warn  me  never  to  come  closer  to  trees.  an  opportunity  I  can’t  just  let  slip  by.  Atinko  come  quickly!”  “at  your  back  already.”  “I  almost  think  it  was  a  ploy  from  someone.”  “If  not  only  me  and  you  I  don’t  think  a  stranger  is  here.”  “Call  me  a  stranger  Atinko.”  “That  parrot  is  too  beautiful.”  “You  also  admire  it?”  I  asked.  “Yes  Paul!  I  saw  it  first  you  knew  that.”  “Well  I  can’t  argue  that.”  “Assist  me  in  climbing  this  tree.”  “Difficult  to  accomplish;  Atinko  you  won’t  understand  my  word.”  “That  is  jealousy,  Paul.”  “time  is  going.”  “Paul  I’m  good  at  climbing  tall  tree.  I’ll  capture  the  parrot  for  you.”  “O,  such  a  nice  person  you  are... Atinko!”  I  fidget.  Atinko  began  to  climb  the  tree.  It  was  evening  and  the  sun  was  dim.  I  sat  on  the  grass  and  watch  in  case  any  assistance  is  needed.  “Can  you  see  me  Atinko?”  I  screamed.  “Yellow  and  blue,  that  is  the  colour  of  your  shirt  Paul!”     I  chuckled.  As  fast  as  he  was;  the  parrot  couldn’t  believe  Atinko  is  good  in  disguise.  “In  my  hand!  In  my  hand!”  “be  careful  Atinko,  don’t  attempt  jumping  down.”  I  flatter  Atinko;  he  crawled  down.  “This  is  it,  have  a  look  at  it.”  Beam  was  on  Atinko’s  face.  “Keep  it  on  the  grass temporary  since  it  is  feeble  to  run.”  I  said.  “That  is  weird  Paul!”  the  single  step  of  the  parrot  on  the  grass  was  funny.  “Let  us  go  after  it  Atinko.”  We  were  smiling  to  us  it  was  like  a  game.  Our  ecstasy  was  denied  when  we  saw  an  enormous  cobra  by  our  side.  We  ran  for  safety.  Fear  supervened.   “Where  are  we  running  to  Atinko?”  I  asked.  “Any  direction  Paul.”  The  sun  was   soft  with  its  red  glow.  We  wander  about  to  the  deepest  end  of  the  forest.  “You  could  have  knew  that  cobra  was  around—Paul!”  “don’t  say  that  because  I  have  never  see  a  cobra  before.”  “Let  us  rest  here  Paul.”  “Bring  out  the  parrot.”  “From  where?”  “your  pouch.”  “I  threw  it  away  to  the  cobra!”  “I  love  the  colour  of  the  feather.”  “Forget  about  that  Paul  and  let  us  get  set  to  go  to  anywhere  we  can  live.”  “How  do  we  explain  this  to  Master  Jerry?”  “Paul  we  have  escaped  from  the  idiot.”  “Why  would  you?”  “Yes  of  course;  the  old  bastard  is  a  fool.  I  have  worked  with  him  as  a   slave  for  almost  ten  years  without  achievement.  Often  he  flow  out  curses  to  my  families  and  generations.”  “How  could  he?”  I  questioned.  “Just  because  the  old  bastard  has  no  family.  He  lost  everything  he  has  when  his  families  were  set  ablaze  in  the  building  they  reside.”  “How  did  it  happen?”  “a  long  time  ago  as  he  told  me,  he  was  a  young  man  every  ladies  admire  due  to  his  promising  future.  Good  in  wrestling  in  the  village;  opposing  forces  are  brought  down  by  Jerry’s  prowess.  He  arouse  the  king  and  his  daughters,  chamberlains  with  his  tactic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  All  the  maids  of  the  king  admire  him  with  gladness  and  they  always  wish  to  wash  his  feet.   Master  Jerry  was  pugnacious.  Attractive  apparel  tied  to  his  waist  as  an  honour.  His  fight  were  prolific;  not  even  a  defeat  in  the  bout.  Master  Jerry  was  known  in  every  places  he  goes  to.  People  in  the  village  sees  him  as  king  to  come.”  “How  can  such  a  wicked  man  be  known?  Okay  maybe  he  is  known  for  his  evils!”  “Paul  it  seems  you  hate  that  man.  He  may  be  nice  far  from  his  pen!”  “Atinko  he  left  me  to  eat  swine  faeces  which  he  purposely  did  to  show  who  he  is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Atinko  a  car  is  coming  right  at  us.  Help  us,  Help  us!”  “Paul  that  car  could  have  been  our  haven.  Now  we  lost  it.”  “Hello  boys!”  “Atinko  the  voice  is  from  the  tree.”  “I’m  an  hunter!”  “Paul  be  alert.  Unearth  yourself  Hunter!”  My  aim  of  being  an  hunter  was  immediately  felt  as  I  stand  face-to-face  to  the  unknown  hunter.  Remembering  the  only  picture  I  have;  Image  of  my  father  and  I  right  in  the  picture.  Rifle  of  double  mouth  clutched  to  his  hands.  Our  cold  steps  varied  as  we  sway.  Luck  can  be  against  us  if  we  decide  to  run  away.  “Come  forward  boys!”   The  hunter  ordered  us  to  be  courageous.  We move  closer  to  him  as  he  came  down  from  the  tree  spreading  his  hands  to  us  for  warmth embracement.  I  dipped  into  millions  of  thought  while  shivering.  Surprisingly  the  hunter  called  me  by my  name.  I  was  praying  for  the  ground  to  swallow  me.  Atinko  who  was  afraid  from  the  onset ran  to  my  back  and  whispered.  “Don’t  go  Paul!”  boldness  in  me  overcame  my  palpitating  belief.  Atinko  tapped  me  all  through.  “Put  away  your  fear,”  said  the  hunter.  “Atinko  let’s  come  closer  to  him.”  “Are  you  out  of  your  mind  Paul?  You  have  not  met  him  before  then  why  are  you  in  a  hurry  to  meet  him?  Be  very  careful.  This  man  must  be  a  serial  killer. Come  to  think  of  it  Paul:  how  did  he  knew  your  name?”  “What  did  you  mean  by  that  Atinko?”  “Please  reason.  This  man  is  sent  by  God  to  help  us.”  “Are  you  mad?”  Atinko  so  bold  with  his  confrontations  against  me.  The  old  pygmy  smiling  with  his  missing  teeth  as  his  hands  were  still  laying  forward.  “You  are  lost  I  can  see  it  in  your  eyes.  Paul  I  am  your  father’s  friend.”  Running  to  him  from  his  word  seems  joyous  to  me;  my  happiness  was  been  found.  “From  the  day  you  were  born  I  can’t  forget  you.  You  have  the  zeal  of  your  father.  Tell  your  friend  to  come  forward  also.”  “Atinko  come  closer  we  don’t  have  much  time.”  “Earth  sky  is  fading  and  I  want  the  two  of  you  to  follow  me  home.”  I  crashed  into  an  avalanche  of  thoughts.  How  the  hunter  knew  my  name  baffled  me.  As  we  walk  quietly  to  his  house  my  eyes  was  numbering  our  footprint.  “This  is  the  road  to  your  home  my  children  so  be  happy.  Paul  your  father  is  like  a  brother  to  me.  My  name  is  Silas.”  “What?  So  you  are  the  kind  person  my  mother  is  always  talking  about?  Life  is  so  strange.  Mr  Silas  my  mother  told  me  how  nice  you  can  be.”  “Is  okay  my  son.  So  Paul  where  is  your  mother?”  “She  is  so  sick  and  the  doctor  diagnosed  her  of  leukaemia.”  “How  comes?”  “Am  still  confused  Mr  Silas.  My  mother  situation  is  retrogressive.  Am  trying  to  raise  money  for  her  upkeep.”  Atinko  shook  his  head,  join  us  in  the  conversation.  “Mr  Silas:  Paul  is  too  good  as  a  friend.  We  met  at  the  pen-house  when  we  were  working  for  our  Master,  named  Jerry.  Our  job  there  is  to  feed  the  swine.”  I  pinched  Atinko  to  be  careful  of  revealing  where  we  were  working  before  escaping  but  it  was  too  late.  Mr  Silas  calmly  yodelling  an  African  music  that  was  interesting  as  myself  and  Atinko  engaged  to  sing  the  blissful  music.  To  me  I  never  knew  Mr  Silas  was  fast  enough  to  hear  what  Atinko  was  telling  him.  “Strange  things  happens  on  this  earth,”  Mr  Silas  said.  We  finally  got  to  his  home  which  lays  beside  the  road  opposite  the  town.  Mr  Silas  house  suave,  green  and  white  colour  of  shapes  trimming  the  environment  in  form  of  castle.  Atinko  never  shy  away  from  feeling  the  air  of  the  house.  “My  first  time  Paul,”  he  says.  “Good  to  see  an  hammock  twisted  around  the  three  branches.”  Fear  ran  from  us  as  the  air of  the  atmosphere  increases.  “Halima!”  Mr  Silas  called  his  wife.  Something  beneficial  communicated  to  Mrs  Halima  ear  from  her  husband.  Mr  Silas  brought  out  a  wooden  chair  for  us  to  sit.  “Be  comfortable  with  this,”  Mr  Silas  pleaded.  His  hospitable  really  appreciable  as  he  was  prepared  to  make  us  happy  in  his  house.  I  enjoyed  every  full treatment  Mr  Silas  gave  us  despite  he  never  knew  us  very  well.  I  feel  the  cool  air  moving  about  undisturbed.  “Thank  you  sir,  this  place  is  great,  I  like  the  cool  atmospheric  condition  of  here.”   
“My  wife  Halima  will  soon  prepare  some  food  for  you  my  children!”  “Thank  you  sir,”  I  said.  Atinko  was  about  making  a  statement  again  I  signal  him  with  my  eyeball.  “Okay.”  He  snapped. “Atinko  I  thought  you  said  something?”  “No  sir!”  “well  boys  excuse  me.”  Our  heavenly  abode seems  to  silence  me  to  a  great  surprise.  “My  children  the  food  is  ready!”  Mrs  Halima  was  really fast  in  preparing  the  evening  food  for  us  and  her  husband.  Her  hands  with  a  tray  of  food.  “Please  manage  the  little  food  and  enjoy  yourself!”  Mrs  Halima  soft-hearted  from  her  appeal. “Thank  you  ma.  We’re  grateful  to  you.”  Myself  and  Atinko  present  our  appreciation  to  Mrs  Halima.  Mrs  Halima  accepted  our  gratitude  and  walked  away.  The  food  was  delicious  indeed  as Atinko  rushed.  After  eating  the  food  it  began  to  rain.  “My  children:  hurry up  and  come  inside!  Halima  lead  them  to  their  room  I  showed  you  before  the  rain  soaked  them!”  Mr  Silas  ordered  his  wife,  Halima.  Mrs  Halima  preventing  us  with  an  umbrella.  Running  to  the  room  was  not  easy  as  everybody  hasty  to  avoid  striking  of  lightning.  Cool  air  spread  across  four  corner  of  our  room,  radio  blasting  with  passion.  Large  fine  hologram  good  to  view.  Image  of  Mr  Silas  and  his  wife  smiling.  “Mr  Silas  is  humane,  don’t  you  think  so  Atinko?”  “um ...  too  early  to  conclude. He  might  be  exactly  what  you  think  of  him.”  The  pillow  on  our  mattress  ease  tiredness  out  of  us.  Kipping,  yawning,  laughing  in  the  room  for  me  gladness  is  materializing.  No  disturbance  of  feeding  the  herd-of-swine.  Memories  of  harsh  treatment  against  me  from  my  master  now  ended.  Making  friends  with  swine;  eating  their  faeces,  pretending  to  my  master  Jerry  I  love  his  herd-of swine  had  stopped.  Loud  snoring  from  Atinko  really  increasing  bit by bit.  Tired  as  Atinko  was  sweat  on  him  ransacked  the  bed-sheet  of  our  mattress.  I  stood  sternly.  Open  window  flashed.  I  peeked.  “Bring  it!”  A  scary  voice  of  an  hag  whipping  about  in earnest,  her  hair  half  scrape.  Street  calmed.  Dogs  beaten  heavily.  Wetness  of  skins  showing  on  both  human  and  animals.  I  scowled.  Immediately  there  was  a  power cut  bringing  the  room  to  darkness.  Huge  desk  beside  the  bed having  all  kind  of  torches  to  brighten  the  room.  My  hand  was  fast.  I  switched  it  on  to  look  outside.  Night  overcame  busy  atmosphere.  “In  this  rain?”  another  woman  was  having  a  large time  chasing  a  lad.  Broom  were  on  her  hand  to  reduce  strength,  agility,  excitement  from  the  lad.  “Woman  leave  him  alone!”  My  voice  not  thick  enough  in  passing  message  of  anger  to  her. “Leave  him!!” every   window  danced,  downbeat  can’t  correct  any  atrocities  committed  aright.  “How  do  I  save  him  from  this  wicked  woman?  Whoa!  I  need   to  come  up  with  an  idea.  What  of  if  something  attack  me?”  murk,  murmur,  screams,  screech,  within  each  vicinity.  I  flick  Atinko.  Eddies  pull  anything  easier  inside  our  room.  Massive  drop  of  water  finding  its  way  into  the  room.  Ceiling  shaking  like  machines  grinding  granite.  Mr  Silas  knew  danger  is  lurking,  empty  bucket,  blankets,  raincoat  to  be  used.  “Paul  jacket  or  raincoat?”  “jacket  sir.”  “Give  Atinko  this  blanket.”  Atinko  awoke  from  his  long  sleep.  “Shift  Atinko,  thunder  so  easy  penetrating  here. Halima  bring  it!  don’t  waste  time,  please!”  I  was  jaded.  I  need  heat.  Mrs  Halima  brought  local  stove,  fire  blowing  cold  away.  The  flames  lambent.  Thick  blanket  on  Atinko.  Mr  Silas  left  us.  Minute  later  Atinko  continued  his  odyssey  sleep.  I   ignore  thinking,  slept  off.  Yet  another  strange  and  dreadful  dream.  Mr  Silas  gently  brought  a  steel  box  containing  ropes  and  amulet.  “My  sons bend  your  heads,  protection  is  important  for  two  of  you!”  Bantus  spoken,  Mr  Silas  chew  two  cola-nut,  knelt,  rub  the  sand.  “Your  neck  my  sons!”  Atinko’s  neck  wore  an  amulet  followed  by  my  neck.  Mr  Silas  tap  our  back,  clean  his  hands  on  his  coloured  singlet.  “Animals,  scorpions,  spirit  shall  never  hurt  you  my  sons.  Fear  not;  thick  sun  and  rain  can’t  meet  each  other,  hence  you  have  both  conquer  any  obstacles  on  your  way.”                                                                                                                                                                                 As  we  were  listening  to  Mr  Silas  as  he  encourage  us;  Mrs  Halima  shouted  to  her  husband  and pointed  a  long  wand  at  us  turning  everybody  to  an  animal.  I  was  the  smallest,  hairy  and  brown.  Mrs  Halima  remove  a  knife  from  her  pocket  of  the  gown  she  wore  and  started  chanting  slow  incantations.  “Tonight  you  animals  will  be  eaten  raw!”  A  bearded  man  with  red  caftan;  pool  of blood  in  his  open  mouth  was  coming  to  confirm  how  we  will  be  used  for  and  offering.  “They  are  smelling  good,”  while  looking  up  he  whistled.  Rain  of  fire  came  from  above  and  turn  into  an  iron  cage  locking  us  immediately.  Mighty  lions  and  tigers  were  just  perambulating  to  pounce  us.  “Mrs  Halima!”  I  shouted.  “Come  and  unlock  the  cage,  we  need  your  help,  hurry  up!  We  are  innocent  and  we  deserve  a  better  life!”  “Quiet  Paul!”  sooner  our  bodies  began  to  change  back  to  the  one  of  a  human  being.  Mr  Silas  shrunk  his  fingers  under  his  buttocks,  remove  a  key  and  insert  it  through  the  padlock.  “It  works,  walk  out  quietly,  the  lions,  tigers  have  slept;  but  how  do  we  understand  this  place?”  “very  easy  Mr  Silas,  I  can  perceive   it  is  that  direction!”  “Mr  Silas,  what  of  if  we  are  incarcerated  again,”  Atinko  asked?  “Then  get  ready,  be  determine  to  face  the  last.  Remember  tonight  is  the  sacrifice,  it  is  must  to  be  hasty.  Hold  my  hands,  say  after  me:  Our  blood  is  bitter.  Our  blood  is  sour  to  the  witches  and  wizard!  don’t  give  up  for  your  lives!  Wait!”  Mr  Silas  wander  to  see  if  Mrs  Halima  and  the  bearded  man  is  coming.  Up,  the  firmament  was  twisting, turning  earth  round  into  blood.  “Look!”  “What? ...  red  sky?  Can  you  hear  that?  The  sound  of  bell,  sacrifice  intended  shall  commence  soon.  Close  your  eyes  and  say  after  me:  I  must  overcome.  God  is  with  me!”  “How  comes  another  evil  dream?  Atinko  wake  up!”  “O,  While  are  you  disturbing  me  from  sleeping!”  “I  am  not,  is  just  that  I  have something  to  tell  you.”  “What?”  “Quiet.  Is  Mr  Silas  still  in  his  room?”  “I  can’t  really  tell  Paul!” “Mrs  Halima  is  a  witch!”  “don’t  be  silly,  how  can  you ..?”  “I  mean  it.  In  the  dream  I  saw  it.  Tonight,  something  might  go  wrong!”  “So  what  is  the  way  out?”  “We  must  escape  from  this  strange  place!”  “Are  you  crazy?  Don’t  you  see  it  is  dark?”  “Well … I  am  leaving  right  now!”  “Now?”  “Is  everything  alright  with  you  my  sons?  I  heard  both  of  you  quarrelling  in  the  room?” “Not  so  Ma!”  “Halima  excuse  us.  I  want  to  talk  to  them  in  privacy.  Don’t  forget  shutting  the door.”  Mrs  Halima  left  our  room.  “So  let  us  be  open  to  ourselves.  Paul  you  have  a  bad  dream!”  “Yes  sir.”  “What’s  it  all  about?”  “A  witchcraft.”  “In  my  house?”  “Yes.”  “Take  this  amulet  and  wear  it  to  prevent  danger.  There  is  still  another  one.  I  think  Atinko  will  also  make  use  of  it.  Take  my  son  and  do  the  same.”  “An  uncountable  thanks  to  you  sir,”  I  said.  “My  brother  Collins  lives  in  Lagos.  In  the  morning  you  shall  both  go  to  meet  him.  He  is  better  positioned  to  provide  job  for  both  of  you.  This  is  an  envelope;  hold  it,  later  tear  it,  an  address  is  inside,  again  there  is  ₦10,000  which  is  enough.  A  long  bus  shall  take  you  to  your  destination.  So  we  see  tomorrow  morning.”  Mr  Silas  close  our  room  door.  I  tried  to  sleep.  The  sleep  unable  to  come  as  a  confirmation  of  the  dream.  It  was  6:00  a. m.  When  I  manage  to  force  myself  to  a  short  sleep.  “Wake  up!  It  is  time  for  the  journey.”  Myself  and  Atinko  were  ready  after  bathing.  “So  let  us  go  to  the  park  my  sons.”  “Goodbye  Mrs  Halima!”  “Bye  my  children.”  We  got  to  the  park.  Board  a  bus.  Our  journey  was  450km  to  Lagos.  I  removed  the  envelope  from  my  pocket  and  read  through:  No. 10  American  road,  Ikeja  Lagos.  We  arrived  successfully  in  Lagos.  “Come  down!”  the  driver  of  the  bus  shouted.  We  all  alighted.  Atinko  was  sharp  to  see  an  old  time  friend  who  took  him  to  his  house.  I  was  alone  to  the  house  of  Mr  Collins  with  nobody  to  accompany  me.  Crossing  over  the  pavement  was  difficult  as  this  is  my  first  time  of  coming  to  a  large  city  like  this.  “I  hope  my  luck  will  shine  here  in  a  favourable  way.”                           
                                                                              CHAPTER    TWO                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
LAGOS  on  my  arrival,  was  boring,  humid  and  brighter;  the  promise  land  looked  more  promising from  the  glimpse  of  the  sand.  Walking  along  was  with  a  magnetic  haste,  however,  the  clay  building,  massed  traffic  and  abandon  gigantic  shop  was  shocking  from  the  viewable  approach.  The  sheer-luck  could  be  achieve  here  as  a  driver  due  to  number  of  positioned  trucks,  caterpillar,  lorries,  bulldozers.  Walking  to  the  end  of  the  road  seems  strenuous  with  a  slim  hopeful  thought.  “Hey!”  Amazed  to  see  a  handsome,  well-dressed  half-caste  sweeping  a  heap  of  trash;  “something  is  wrong;  he  suppose  to  be  decisive  in  authorities.  How  comes?  Mr  Collins  must  shed  more  light on  this  issue.  I  definitely  know  that.”  “Move  faster!”  the  slave  worker  hurried  me;  his  dark  trousers  hugging  his  thin  narrow  legs  as  he  was  fast  to  deliver.  “Excuse  me sir!”  a  quick  pause look  came  from  him;  to  him,  as  the  work  begins  seriousness  is  part  of  the  agenda.  “Give  me  your  address!”  as  if  he  knew  what  I  intended  presenting  to  him.  Stretching  his  fingers  to  me  was  a  welcome  solitude;  I  gave  him  the  address  of  Mr  Collins  as  I  gaze  through  his  inquisitive  eyeball.  “Oh,  Collins!”  he  chuckle,  scratch  his  curled  hair.  “I  knew  him.  He  is  famous  in  this  city. Follow  me,  that  building  over  there  is  where  he  stays.”  “In  that  place?”  “Yes.  Are  you  scared?”  he  asked.  “No.  Thanks.”  “You  are  welcome.”  Breeze  inert  felt  my  presence.  Flowers  emotionally  shaking  to  show  how  appreciating  city  life  was.  Horning  of  car  everywhere.  “So  great!”  Watching a  team-of-lads  playing  a  ball  on  grassy  nearby  field;  each  of  them  grinned.  “Pass  it  to  me!”  I longed  to  play.  Happiness  on  the  field  can  be  measured  in  a  lengthy  way  due  to  the  calmness  around.  “Goal!  I  have  done  it!”  name  of  the  scorer  tone.  Jersey  of  most  valuable  players  in  the  world  wore  by  the  scorer  on  the  field.  “I  shall  dedicate  this  to  my  mentors,”  he  declared. “Wait.  You  are  almost  hitting  me,”  I  said  to  him.  Jumping  himself  on  me  was  all  the  best  he  can  do  in  making  me  smile  to  him.  “I  am  proudly  welcoming  you  to  community  field.  I  guess you  are  new  in  this  city  of  Lagos?”  “Yes  of  course.  I’m  going  to  my  uncle’s  place.”  “... Who  is  he?”  “Mr  Collins!”  “Mr  Collins  a  philanthropic  person.  He  donates  heavy  sum  on  any  important  match;  friends  and  lovers  of  football  knew  him  well.”  “You  mean  he  cherished  football?”  “Yes.  Very  well.  Mr  Collins  your  uncle  usually  buy  footballs  and  share  it  to  all  the  children  he  sees  on  the  field;  promoting  football  as  a  game  is  something  he  can’t  ignore  at  all  time.  Look  at  this  small  shining  emblem  on  my  neck.  It  was  been  giving  to  me  by  your  uncle,  Mr  Collins.  Rare  to  score  an  hat trick  in  any  final  of  competitions  on  this  field.  I  did  that.  That  is  a  record  that  is  hard  to  break.”  “Is  a  pleasure  talking  with  you.  I  will  see  you  next  time.”  “Your  bag!”  “Oh!  Thank  you.  Your  name?”  “Peter.”  “So  Peter,  anytime  I  come  here  we  will  talk  better.  My  name  is  Paul.”  “Your  name  sound  familiar  to  me;  maybe  because  the  name  is  a  great  name.”  “Thank  you ...  Peter.  I  appreciate.  See  you ... soonest.”  “Please  don’t  forget  to  come  back.”  “I  will.”  Speed  and   desperation  to  get  to  Mr  Collins  house  retain  my  steps  as  I  get  closer;  someone  unknown  waved  me.  “Such  a  tall  building.  How  do  I  climb?  Where  can  I  see  the  staircase ...?  too  tall!”  My surprise  was  narrow  by  an  hefty  dog  cracking  a  large  bone  after  killing  his  prey.  “So  many  rooms  up;  which  room  actually  is  he?  Every  window  is  tightly  shut.  Who  can  help  me  out.”  “Wait,  do  you  intend  going  up?”  “Yes.  Right  now.”  Turning  myself  backward  to  have  a  chat  with  the  person  speaking  to  me  was  faster;  I  saw  that  as  an  opportunity  which  I  must  not  delay. “David  tell  me  it  is  not  you!  Don’t  say  anything  David.  I  must  confirm  if  this  is  y-you.   If  I  see  the  mark  on  your  forehead  I  should  be  able  to  believe  I  am  standing,  front  of  my  friend.”                                          
“Paul  so  this  is  you?”  Snuggling  each  other  was  an  unforgettable  memory  after  seeing  ourselves last  in  Jerry’s  abode.  David  beards  growing  out  from  his  immature  jaw,  his  muscle  forming  quick  macho  as  a  result  of  hard  work.  “Sorry  for  leaving  you  behind.”  I  pleaded  to  David.  “Thank  God we  can  still  see  again  Paul.  Well  let’s  go  inside  so  that  you  can  have  a  good  rest.  “This  is  the place  I  now  stay.  Working  here  is  easy  as  an  housekeeper.  My  time  here  not  monitored  unlike when  I  was  with  Jerry.  This  job  was  given  to  me  by  a  kind-hearted  man,  which  name  is  Collins.”  “Collins?”  “Any  problem?”  “is  just  that  this  letter  was  given  to  me  by  one  Mr  Silas  who  said  Collins  is  his  brother.”  “To  me  that  man  is  my  boss.  So  feel  free  here.  “All  Jerry’s  worker  depart  after  his  demise.”  “Is  he  dead?”  “He  was  bitten  by  snake  in  the  night.  By  morning  death  took  him  away.  His  death  really  sad,  big  blow  to  us  as  we  find  nowhere  to  reside.  Weeks  so  difficult; sojourning,  begging  crumbs  of  food,  dirty  water  splashed  to  chase  all  of  us  working  for  Jerry.  “Travellers  going  to  Lagos  were  my  recourse.  On  getting  to  this  city;  vacancy  as  an  housekeeper  was  the  first  thing  I  saw,  trust  me  I  don’t  delay, now  I  am  here  enjoying.  Bring  out  your  letter  I  want  to  see  your  address.”  “Take.”  “Good,  lets  climb  the  stairs.  This  door  exactly.  Enter.”  “Such  as  big...?”  “don’t  be  carried  away  my  friend.  Rice  for  you,  if  that’s  your  choice  then  am  bringing  it.  I  can  also  boil  an  hot  water  if  needing  it.  taking  your  bathe  with  it  is  important.”  “David  food  before  taking  my  bathe.”  I  belched.  Wonderful  place  I  can’t  just  imagine.  Rug  on  the  parlour  floor  smooth,  too  neat,  crispy.  Merely  putting  your  foot  usual  breath  is  likely  to  seize  due  to  feel  at  home  grip.  I  sat  after  staring  anything  strange  to  me.  I  stood  from  the  soft  couch.  My  eyes  won’t  stop  at  nothing;  jellyfish  swimming  in  the  aquarium  to  catch  a  glimpse  of  me,  as  if  they  smell  that  I  was  a  stranger.  “Aquarium  not  to  be  touch,  Paul!”  “I  only  heard  of  fish  swimming  deep  in  the  river,  not  inside  a  transparent  box.”  “Your  water  fully  ready,  go  and  have  yourself  in  the  bath-tub.”  David  unease.  He  pant  openly.  I  turn  immediately  something  struck  me.  “Problem  to  solve?”  I  asked.  “Hmmm!  Mr  Collins  has  been  keeping  late  at  night.  His  wife  I  believe  will  utter  her  displeasure  to  this.”  Flash  from  the  T.V.  set  scared  David.  News  of  murder  pinch  him.  “Murder!  Murder!  Murder!  O,  this  mustn’t  happen  again.”  Already,  redness  filled  screen  graphics.  “I  hate  watching  innocent  people  been  murder  in  cold-blood.  Last  month  how  can ... I  tell  you  this  Paul.  I  cried  that  night  when  an  old  woman  rushing  to  see  her  only  daughter  giving  birth  after  so, so  much  wasted  years  of  childlessness  with  her  husband  unjustly  murdered.  Police-men  drafted  to  bring  all  culprit  to  book  concerning  the  old  woman’s  death  met  a  superhuman  that  rose  from  better  equipment.  Guns  and  bullets  piled  up  in  a  war  ready  way.  Children,  adult,  cripple,  old men  ran  for  their  life  to  prevent  unplanned  death.  The  sky-scraper  hospital  blinking  an  alarm  light  just  to  alert  all  security  personnel  of  danger.  “Scary  panicking,  helter-skelter,  shouting,  looting,  fainting  from  being  stressed  all  around.  I-I  pitied  everybody.   Scene  good  to  watch;  but  not  in  this  particular  incident,  believe  me.  Victims  of  indigent  parents  lying  on  the  ground,  red  blotch  change  their  look  to  the  one  of  a  red  gown  worn  by  priest.  Ambulance  speed.  Food   on  table  got  cold.  My  appetite  turn  different.  Tears  from  me  makes  my  face  sticky.  Mr  Collins  came  out  from  his  room  as  at  then  it  is  10: 00  in  the  night.  Unable  to  talk,  surprises  on  him.  The  T. V.  Set  volume.  He  push  the  chair  by  his  side  and  sat  to  watch.  “Just  ten  men  did  all  this?  Robbers?  Banks  closing  for  fear  of  coming  after  customers  money?  Mr  Collins  shifted  to  my  seat,  touch  my  body,  shook  his  head  in  confusion,  off  the  T.V. set.  I  stood,  about  going  to  my  room,  Mr  Collins  held  my  hands,  remove  his  handkerchief,  mopped  my  sweaty  face.  I  now  remember  I  was  hungry.”  “Oh  my  mother!  She  is  in  this  city,  David.”                                                                                                                                                                                                        “Stranger  in  my  house?  Who  is  this?”  “Paul  the  master  is  here.  Mr  Collins.”  “What  a  pleasure standing  right  before  you  sir!”  “you  must  have  come  so  long,  I  guess.”  His  toothy  smiles  won’t   shy  away,  his  dotted  cheeks  sunk  deeper.  Curve  thick  specs,  dark,  glue  to  his  face.  “Any  short   message  for  me?”  “No.  Mr  Silas  sent  his  greetings  through  me.”  “We  have  different  Silas  in  this world,  which  Silas  are  you  referring  to?”  “Your  brother.”  “But  he  suppose  to  visit  me  all  this while.  Many  times  as  often  my  guess  has  proven  me  wrong;  will  Silas  stop  sending  people  to me?  So,  you  came as  far  to  borrow  money  from  me  as  requested  by  Silas.”  “Only  here  for  job.” “Right  now  boy;  the  services  of  an  housekeeper  needed.  By  tomorrow  it  will  be  promulgated through  the  mass media.”  “No  need  sir!  Keeping  your  house  clean  is  mandatory,  I  am  more  capable.”  “... Well  my  boy:  trial  first  before  full  confirmation.  You  can  start  work  from  tomorrow. Your  conversations  with  David  seems  you  met  before?”  “Not  so  sir.”  “Last  year  someone  came on  a  pretence  conspire  with  his  friend  to  work  in  my  house  as  an  housekeeper.  All  my  money looted.  David  has  shown  himself  so  great  and  he  can  be  trusted  anytime.  Emulate  his  trust,  you shall  have  no  fear  or  worry.  We  see  in  the  morning.”  Mr  Collins  walked  into  his  room.  Each  second,  the  wall  clock  ticked.  “Paul  it’s  time  to  sleep.  Your  room,  beside  Mr  Collins  room.  He  will  know  if  you  sneak  out  of  your  room.  Be  trustworthy.  Blanket  positioned  in  case  of  cold.”  “Thank  you  David.”  I  opened  my  room  door,  crashed  on  the  soft  mattress.  Bulb  glowed.  I  close  my  eyes,  open  it  immediately.  I  search  on  how  to  off  the  switch;  luckily  I  found  it.  I  switched  it  off.  Unbelievable,  crow  of  cock  awoke  me.  It  was  already  morning.  I  stood  up.  Stretched  my  hands.  I  took  my  tooth-brush  beside  me,  open  a  bathroom  door  opposite  me,  went  in  and  brush  my  teeth.  I  finished,  slept  back  on  my  room-mattress.  “Paul  wake  up!  Mr  Collins  needs your  service.”  “Oh,  day  is  bright?”  “Hurry  up.”  I  ran  to  prevent  unexpected  sack  from  my  boss. “Good  morning  sir!”  “how  was  your  night  my  boy?”  “Fine  sir!”  “now  go  into  my  room;  clean  up the  floor,  make  sure  you  take  care  of  everything  seen  there.”  “Consider  done  sir!”  coming  near the  room,  flowery  scent  melt  into  my  nose.  “This  room  is  great!  Marked  with  exotic  colours. Cleaning  here,  so  easy.”  I  went  informing  my  boss  quickly  that  I  am  through.  “Boss,  assignment  perfectly  done.”  “Very  sure  my  boy?”  “Yes  boss.”  “Is  your  mother  in  this  city?”  “Sir: she  is  very sick.”  “Of  what?”  “leukaemia.”  “A  critical  situation  she  must  had  been  by  now.”  “As  if  you  knew  boss.”  “How  about  your  father?”  “he  is  not  around.”  “Is  he  dead?”  “Sir,  he  is  in  Somalia.  I  know  he  wished  seeing  me.  How  I  feel  his  presence  every  day.  For  now,  am  unable  to  pay  my  mother’s  hospital  bill.  My  plans  actually  is  how  to  raise  some  money  from  my  salary.”  “Don’t  worry  my  boy;  we  shall  both  go  to  the  hospital  your  mother  is.”  “Sir,  Doctor  Phills  had  warn  me  to  pay  her  bills.  At  first,  she  was  in  the  north,  admitted  for  treatment  there,  but  later  transferred  here  for  blood  transfusion.”  “North  to  south?  Sometimes;  it  is  very  dangerous  to  donate  blood  because,  patient  might  as  well  die.”  “I  want  to  donate  my  blood.”  “since  is  your  mother,  no  problem;  If  the  Doctor  complain  of  inadequate  blood  I  will  donate  mine  to  save  your  mother.”  “Good  of  you,  boss.  I  appreciate.”  “Get  ready  tomorrow!  By  the  way  have  you  eaten?”  “No.”  “Go,  cook  your  choice  of  food.  David  will  put  you  through  if  assistance  is  needed.”  “I  can  boss.”  “Good  in  cooking?”  “Yes  boss.  My mother  taught  me  that.  Boss  your  wife  travelled?”  “Yes;  in  three  days  time  she  will  be  here,   though  I  receive  a  call  from  her  explaining  reason  for  delays.  Be  free  here!  “My  wife,  a  gentle type.”  “Boss  your  clothes  sir!  I  am  also qualified  to  wash  many  if  you  insist.”  “Here,  my  boy,   washing-machine  can  do  it  easily!  I  like  your  courage,  keep  up  with  it,  sky  shall  be  your  limit.  Believe  me  my  boy  Paul.  Believe  me.                                                                                                                                                                         
A  lady  with  dry-cleaning  profession  will  be  here  by  10:00;  her  name  is  Georgina.  Working  for almost  five  years  without  acting  against  her  profession.”  “Sir,  your  phone  rang  just  now!”  buzz  from  the  phone  won’t  stop.  “That  might  be  Janet,  filmy  intelligent  journalist,  so  adamant.  She  just  want  to  interview   me  as  there  is  rivalry  in  my  business.  Most  business-mogul  pays  heavily to  bring  my  company  down.  They  uses  journalist  to  get  factitious  information  from  you.”  “Do away  with  her  boss.”  “My  boy  thanks  for  your  advice.  We  can  go  and  check  your  mother’s  condition  at  the  hospital.”  “But … am  I  not  stressing  you  boss?”  “Not  as  you  think,  my  boy.”  “Good  morning sir!”  “Paul  my  driver  is  here.  Lawal  by  name,  married,  now  father  to  three  girls. Lawal  meet  my  new  housekeeper.  He  is  Paul  by  name.  He  arrived  yesterday.”  Mr  Lawal  fix  a  stick  of  cigarette  in  his  mouth,  remove  his  matchbox  from  back  pocket,  pull  out  matchstick,  strike  fire  direct  to  his  cigarette.  “My  boss  you  said?”  “meet  Paul.”  Mr  Lawal  embraced  me,  rub  my  back,  puffed.  “Lawal,  drive  us  to  see  Paul’s  mother,  she  is  critically  ill  at  the  hospital.  Paul  told  me  his  mother  was  transferred  here.  Let  us  go  now!”  we  squeeze  ourselves,  fastening  the  seat belt,  in  a  jiffy,  Mr  Lawal  drove  hurriedly.  Usual  city  hold-up  free,  cars  so  scanty  on  tiled  road.  Getting  closer  a  colossal  dolphin  shaped  hospital  was  noticed.  “This  is  the  place,  I  believe!”  Mr  Collins  said.  We  forced  down.  “Gregory,  friend  of  mine  is  in  ward-9.  Hello  nurse  is  Doctor  Gregory  around?”  Which  ward  is  he?”  “Ward-9.”  “Okay...he  was  here  before  but  now  transferred  to  the  east.”  “Margaret  come  OO!  The  patient  just  died  now!”  “Doctor  Phills,  you  mean  that  leukaemia  patient?”  “Yes.  Paul  where  have  you  been  all  this  while?”  “I  was  so  busy  hustling  for  fund  to  pay  my  mother’s  bill.”  “Um,  always  flimsy  excuses  right  from  the  north.  For  your  information;  your  mother  just  parted  to  eternity.”  “MAMA!”  “This  is  not  the  better  time  to  shout;  by  the way,  have  you  been  working?”  “Y-Yes,  as  an  housekeeper.”  “Who  is  this  by  your  side?”  “My  boss.”  “You  have  a  boss  and  you  can’t  explain  your  present  situation  to  him.”  “Doctor  Phills, yesterday  was  the  day  I  just  got  a  job.”  “Too  late  Paul!  Go  and  see  your  mother  quickly  before she  is  moved  to  the  mortuary.  Go  to  ward-9.”  I  frowned.  Around  us,  bereaved  shedding  tears,  almost  everyone  has  lost  someone  close  to  them.  Mr  Collins  held  me,  closer  to  us  was  ward-9.  Mr  Collins  open  the  door,  my  mother  lay  helpless,  her  body  stiffed,  her  open  eyes  darkened.  I  closed  her  eyes.  I  spoke  to  her  left  ear,  she  gave  no  answer  to  me.  Coming  closer  to  her  bed  a  folded  note,  exposing  itself  to  be  read.  Carrying  it  to  read  was  my  aim.         I  spread  the  note  wider.  The writing  was  clear  and  easy  to  read.  It  says:  My  dear  Paul  I  am  waiting  to  hear  from  you  before  I  die.  Since  when  we  saw  ourselves  last  things  had  been  different.  I  was  comatose  for  ten  months!  My  spiritual  realm  was  so  strange.  Paul  could  you  believe  my  mother  was  the  first  to  welcome  me  to  the  place  she  saw  as  a  home  fit  for  my  living.  She  said  all  this  while  it  has  been  tough  for  me  after  she  left  me  in  the  world.  So,  it  was  an  opportunity  for  me  to  tell  her my  state  after  her  death.  I  couldn’t  hold  back  my  tears  seeing  her.  Surprisingly,  an  angel  took  me  to  a  crystal  place.  Angels  flew  happily  as  I  got  there.  The  angel  who  brought  me  made  it  clear  to  me  that  sick  and  distress  people  comes  here  after  their  death.  Everyone  has  an  angel,  I  never  knew  he  was  my  angel  until  he  told  me.  No  more  death  in  that  crystal  place.  I  guess  that  place  is  heaven.  People  that  has  suffered  unjustly  in  the  earth  smiling  about.  Wild  animals  of  earthy  forest  gathered  to  play  with  me;  uncountable  animals  rectilinear.  My  angel  took  me  again  to  where  dead  babies  resurrected  to.  I  cried  when  I  saw  babies  running  to  hug  me,  to  them  I  have  join  them  in  their  new  abode.  My  hands  filled  as  I  was  carrying  all  of  them.                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Most  of  the  popular  people  dead  in  the  world  were  seen  there;  no  securities  to  avoid  them  from nearing  the  just.  Vast  opportunity  for  me  eating  alongside  all  celebrities  dead  for  long  in  the  earth.  Paul  my  angel  told  me  to  go  back  and  tell  all  bereaved,  all  broken  hearted  that  he  is with  them  when  they  are  always  alone.  HE  even  assured  me  that  praying  to  God  receive  speedy answers;  but  sometimes  when  we  pray  and  it  didn’t  come  to  pass;  that  might  not  mean  God had  abandon  us;  miraculously,  our  prayers  shall  be  a  big  boost  to  us.  Paul  no  more  rain,  snow, heat,  earthquake,  hurricane  tornado,  eclipse  of  the  sun  in  that  strange  place.  It  got  to  a  time your  father  comes  to  my  mind;  I  start  searching  for  him  everywhere.  Multi-coloured  men  and women  wore  gorgeous  garment;  singing,  clapping,  dancing  to  praise  their  creator.  I  smiled  happily  watching  them.  As  I  fold  my  hands,  I  can’t  forget  thinking  of  you  and  my  husband.        My  angel  flew  to  me,  as  if  he  knew  I  intended  asking  something  from  him.  I  look  into  his  eyes  and  I  saw  his  eyes  flamed.  He  disappeared,  I  ran,  as  I  fear  danger.  Uncommon  to  run  about  as  nothing  can  chase  anyone.  I  never  knew  my  angel  was  waiting  for  me  to  where  I  was  running  to.  He  called  me  and  asked  of  my  intention.  My  angel  encouraged  me  to  ask  any  question.  I  begged  him  to  tell  me  if  my  husband  is  there  with  him.  I  didn’t  wait  for  his  answer,  I  told  him  my  husband  can’t  be  found  on  earth.  My  angel  assured  me  your  father  is  still  in  the  world  we  both  lived.  To  crown  it  all,  he  ordered  me  to  continue  to  check  everywhere  I  can.  My  angel  disappear  before  any  word  produce  out  of  my  mouth.  I  forgot  telling  my  angel  your  father  said  he  was  heading  to  Somalia.  Though,  I  wasn’t  sure  of  myself  that  alone  denied  me  of  facts.  Besides,  The  letter  your  father  dropped  before  going  does  not  look  real.  Paul,  my  breath  was  cut  short  as  my  name  rung  to  my  ears  in  clangour.  Retinue  of  choristers  singing  their  glorious  music  to  their  supreme  being.  They  retard  me  with  their  songs.  Large  vicinity  to  occupy  trillions  of  people;  surprised  to  see  only  few  men  and  woman  there.  There  were  lots  of  fruits  to  eat.  Merely touching  my  body,  no  more  leukaemia.  Paul  don’t  steal  from  anyone.  Keep  being  gentle.  Close  the  animals  cote  to  prevent  them  from  escaping.  Feed  them  with  grains  to  aid  their  growth;  as you  know,  growing  bigger  attract  more  sales,  that  means  more  cash  to  start  your  schooling.  Bad  friends  are  around  avoid  them  to  be  a  good  person  always.  Your  father’s  friend  Mr  Silas  is  a  kind  man.  If  you  come  across  him,  greet  him  and  avoid  telling  him  my  conditions.  Try  not  being  lazy  because  laziness  is  sin.  Doctor  Phills  had  been  recourse  to  me;  he  is  doing  his  best  for  my  recovery.  Thank  him  very  well  in  case  I  die.  Love  is  determination,  some  people  sees  it  as  a  game,  but  see  it  as  an  opportunity  for  you  building  up  your  relationship  with  the  opposite  sex.  Lady  engaged  to  someone  should  be  last  thing  on  earth  for  you  when  is  time.  Success  is  measured  by  achievement  if  only  working  harder  to  succeed.  Trust  no  one  except  your  true  living  God  who  never  lie.  Our  guardian  angel  always  follows  us  anywhere,  to  avoid  danger;  my  angel  told  me  that.  Each  time  I  pray,  my  prayers  goes  to  you  in  millions.  Paul  cheer  up  and  don’t  weep  for  me  in  case  I  die.  My  return  to  that  place  which  I  saw  as  heaven  is  near.  The reason  why  my  angel  sent  me  back  to  the  world  was  that  my  last  letter  had  not  been  written  to  you  before  coming.  Now  that  my  letter  had  been  written  and  kept  beside  me,  my  guardian  angel  will  appear  soonest  to  carry  me  along  to  that  beautiful  place.  One  day  when  is  your  time, you  too  shall  see  for  yourself  how  better  that  place  is  than  the  world  we  are  living  today.  Paul  think  twice  in  any  race  of  life;  hence,  pit  dug  for  you  can’t  overcome  you.  Men  we  all  see  as great  men  start  from  a  step  filled  with  determination.  Rush  not  as  there  is  no  short  route  to excel.  Thank  you,  very,  very  much  as  my  only  child.  “With  love  from  your  only  mother, Paulina!”                 Reading  the  letter  was  not  a  problem;  while  reading  it, I  trickled  as  I  got  to  the  final  end.  I  was  in  quivering  situation;  I  flapped  after  the  last  word.  Stupendous  letter  I  can’t  forget  was  that  of  my  mother.  I  was  falter  if  really  she  was  the  writer  of  the  unforgettable  letter.  Something  is  sure,  I  was  aware  my  hands  were  clammy  and  there  were  sweat  beads  on  my  face  all  through.  “No ... no!  Mama,  please  tell  me  you  are  only  sleeping!”  “Paul  take  heart,  your  mother  has  tried enough.”  Doctor  Phills,  passionate  by  mopping  my  tears;  he  stood  calm  and  burst  into  a  harsh tears.  Condolence  to  me  and  my  boss—Mr  Collins.  “How  do  I  bury  her?”  “In  the  cemetery.”  “No money  for  that  boss.”  “All  the  burial  arrangement  shall  be  my  responsibility.  Today  her  body  will  be  laid  to  rest.  My  wife  Hillary  is  here,  She  can’t  see  me.  Hillary,  come  forward!”  “wait  for me!”  Hillary  ran,  hugged  Mr  Collins,  kissed  him.  “Our  new  housekeeper;  meet  him  my  wife.”  “He  is  crying.  Hope  no  problem?”  “Our  new  housekeeper  lose  his  mother.  She  had  been  sick  for  long.”  “Really?  Georgina  told  me  you  are  here.  At  first,  I  was  too  scared.  Thank  God  nothing  is wrong  with  you.”  “Good  of  you  as  my  wife.  By  the  way,  did  you  come  across  Lawal?”  “Yes.  So busy  smoking.”  “Hillary  go  and  tell  him  to  get  ready  by  starting  the  car.”  “Paul  I  feel  your  pain  as  your  mother’s  doctor.”  “Thanks  Doctor  Phills,  my  mother  wrote  your  kindness.  This  was  the  copy  of  letter  beside  her.”  I  handed  Doctor  Phills  the  letter;  he  read  it  openly  undisturbed.  “There  is  nothing  more  to  say  but  to  wish  her  farewell!”  “I  think  her  body  can  be  moved  to  the  closest  cemetery.”  “Now?”  I  asked.  “Yes.  Lawal’s  younger  brother  works  in  cemetery  closer  here.  Time  to  carry  her  corpse.”  “Hillary  help  us  out!”  Doctor  Phills  pleaded.  Hillary  fully  ready  as  she  came  eager  to  lift  the  longest  patient  now  dead.  “Take!”  Mr  Collins  pinned  out  some  money  and  gave  it  to  Doctor  Phills.  “Good  of  you;  but  the  money  should  be  used  for  Paul’s  mother  burial.  See  you  next  time.”  “Why  Doctor  Phills?”  “Paul  I  am  a  disciplinarian  in  my  profession.  Margaret!  Taking  the  corpse  for  burial  had  been  decided.  Join  us  to  carry  Paul’s  mother  to  Mr  Collins  car.”  Doctor  Phills  said.  “My  driver  is  waiting  outside.  Let’s  be  faster!”  all  hands  were  so  busy.  Mr Lawal  stern  face  signals  how  angry  he  was  due  to  delay.  “Inside  Margaret.”  “Perfect!  See  you  Doctor  Phills!”  Mr  Collins  shook  his  head,  embrace  Margaret  for  her  gesture.  Hillary  stare  in  wonder.   “A  nurse  about  taking  what  belongs  to  me?  Leave  my  husband,  you  nonentity!  Ugly slut  like  you.  My  husband  time  to  go.  I  can’t  take  this  anymore!”  Margaret  hissed,  walked  away.  “Goodbye  Mr  Collins.”  Margaret  flushed.  “I  must  deal  with  her,  I  promise.”  “Why  Hillary?”  Mr  Collins  beckons.  Drive  to  the  cemetery  was  immediate.  “Almost  there!”  The  road  was  volatile;  each  angle  we  pass,  Mr  Lawal  galloped.  “This  place!”  Mr  Lawal  pointed.  The  steering  longing  for  a  stop.  “Vast  space  sir!”  the  cemetery  attendant  smiling  to  lift  the  corpse  for  burial.  “Business  as  usual.  Your  money  for  tax.”  “Is  my  brother  around?”  “Lawal  your  brother  went  home  not  long.”  “You know  me?”  “Of  course!”  “Take.  Keep  the  rest  change.  Oh,  I  need  to  add  something  more  for  you.”  Mr  Collins  open  his  briefcase,  counted  some  money  and  gave  it  to  the  tax  man.  “Nice doing  business  with  you  sir,”  said  the  tax  man.  “For  the  epitaph.  What  day  did  she  died?”  “today.”  “Time  for  dirge.  Your name?”  “Paul.”  “Anything  to  write?”  “Like?”  “Elegiac  message.  Be faster.  The  priest  is  standing  by.  Use  this  pen  and  compose  anything.”  “Completed.”  “ ... Ready  priest!”  “your  name?”  “Paul.”  “Read  this  out  aloud.”  I  read  as  commanded.  “It  is  done,”  said  the  priest.  “Pour  a  sand  on  her  casket  to  bid  her  farewell.”  “NO!  MAMA  take  me  to  that  place!  I  want  to  go!”  “Paul  it  is  final.  Time  to  go  home.  My  wife  and  Lawal  is  waiting  for  us.  Thank  you  priest.”  A  blessed  prayers  was  directed  to  us  as  we  left  the  cemetery  going  home  tired. “Sorry  for  delaying  all  of  you.  Myself  and  Paul  wishes  to  grant  our  apology.”  “Time  to  go  boss.”                                                                                                “Now  part  of  our  family.  Paul  don’t  worry.  I  shall  treat  you  kindly.  Life  sometimes  is  like  that.     I  Hillary  Collins,  I  will  take  care  of  you  anytime,  any  day.”  “That  is  enough  Hillary,  Paul  don’t  need  disturbance.”  Mr  Collins  pleaded.  “Mission  to  accomplish  in  life  must  start  now,  Paul.                                         When  time  of  nature  calls  nobody  stand  as  obstacle.  Your  mother  must  had  been  a  kind-hearted woman.  Large  turnout  of  sympathizers  paying  tribute  to  her.  I  was  almost  hit  down  by  them.  So scary.”  “Thanks  boss,  you  are  one  of  a  kind.  If  I  can  come  back  in  a  new  world,  I  suggest  being  a  carpenter.  Money  won’t  be  a  barrier;  then  my  mother  should  be  able  to  enjoy  my  labour  as  her  only  child.”  “Paul,  this  must  be  statement  out  of  your  mind.  Reason  higher  to  acquire.”  Hillary  warns.  “For  now,  your  major  target  is  how  to  be  great  in  life.  We  shall  make  that  a  necessity.  Reason  with  me  Paul.  Best  thing  happening  to  someone  aiming  success  in  life  is  going  to  learn.”  “We  are  back  home,  sir!”  Mr  Lawal  voiced.  The  car  was  exhausted  from  the  distance;  moving  from  place  to  place  slow  its  parking.  Georgina  ran,  flung  her  hands  forward  to  welcome  Mrs  Hillary Collins  who  she  knew  as  her  boss  wife.  I  was  shocked  to  see  her  well  fine  smiling  shining-teeth;  one  might  say  she  is  a  model  standing  before  her  judges.  “Follow  her  upstairs,  Paul.  Georgina  show  him  his  new  room!”  “Boss,  new  room  for  me?”  “Yes.  Not  only  here  to  do  housekeeping   job.  Also  here  as  member  of  my  family.”  “Your  creator  shall  reward  you  for  this,  sir!”  “O,  Paul  that  is  enough.”  Georgina  never  believed  I  knew  how  to  get  to  the  difficult  iron staircase  of  the  upstairs.  “So  familiar  here  more  than  me,  Paul.  This  is  it!”  “For  me  alone?”  “Paul,  who  else  do  you  think  this  room  is  for?”  “So  large  to  occupy  myself  Georgina.”  “Most properties  of  yours  should  be  here!”  “Georgina  how  could  you,  haven’t  David  told  you  my  poor  state?”  “Hmmm.  No!”  “The  first  day  I  arrived  here  was  pitiful.  My  shirt  on  me  so  dirty,  more  of  a  rag.  Heavy  stinking  rags  was  in  my  bag.  Later  that  night,  I  threw  away  all  my  rags  before  it  put  me  into  trouble.”  “Well ... looking  neat.  Paul  I  have  something  to  tell  you.”  “Okay  you  can  say  it.” “Daily  devotion  here.  We  don’t  miss  that  not  even  by  mistake.  No  matter  how  tired  you  are,  as the  clock  struck  seven  every  morning,  no  excuse.  This  year  is  my  fifth  year  I  worked  in  this  place.  Handling  my  boss  clothes  is  a  priority.  I  would  dry-clean  some  this  night.  Mr  Collins  have  meeting  to  attend  tomorrow  by  11:00.”  “Can  I  do  that  for  you  Georgina?”  “no  knowledge  on  that,  as  you  know  any  slip  will  lead  to  sack.”  “Tomorrow  we  shall  see,  Georgina.”  “Good  night.”  From  the  hospital  to  cemetery,  now  at  home.  Busy  day  to  remember.  I  look  through  the  window.  City  of  various  activities  became  quiet.  I  can’t  sleep,  my  mother’s  death  denied  my  happiness.  “Oh  MAMA  how  I  feel  your  presence  right  now.  How  should  life  be  for  me  without  you?  Don’t  expect  me  to  sleep,  speak  to  me!”  My  heart  thumping.  My  legs  trembling.  I  was  cold.  My  dead  mother  calling  me.  “I  am  here  mama!  Her  voice  cracking  and  out  of  control.  She  appeared  front  of  me,  clapping  her  hand  and  blowing  bubbles  at  me.  The  appearance  of  her  shows  her  love  towards  me  as  her  only  child.  As  I  move  towards  her,  she  disappeared.  “I  LOVE  YOU  MAMA!”  “Any  problem  Paul?”  “she  came  to  me!”  “who  actually  came?”  “my  mother!”  “really?”  “Yes ...  boss.”  “Wait  for  me,  I  want  to  call  Hillary!”  as  if  Hillary  knew  her  attention  is  needed,  she  pant while  entering  the  room.  “Paul’s  mother  not  quite  long  came  here,  Hillary!”  “whoa!”  “Paul  follow  me  to  my  room,  that  is  the  best  place  for  you  this  night.”  Mr  Collins  pull  off  his  jacket  and  gave  me  to  put  on  before  heading  to  his  room.  “Boss,  my  mother’s  garment  was  too  white.”  “Are ...  you  really  sure  the  person  who  appeared  to  you  was  your  mother?”  “boss,  from  far  I  can  recognise  my  mother.”  “This  my  room  won’t  give  you  hallucination. That  is  my  picture  above.  Come  and  touch  it.  I  take  a  snap  when  I  went  to  Amsterdam  last  year.”  “Nice  boss.”  Leering  at  him,  this  reminds  me  of  my  father  in  one  of  his  old  picture,  sitting  beside  a  white  man.  “Mulattoes!  I  remember  a  picture  of  a  man  born  from  mixed  parents.  The  people  standing  close  to  you  seems  they  are  aboriginal.”  “Umm,  most  of  them  are  from  Africa;  good  friends  of  mine.”  “Pictures  of  old  days,  tells  more  how  the  people  lives  off  pomposity;  shaggy  hair  style  can  be  used  to  describe  fellows  of  those  days.”  “I  have  board  meeting  to  attend  as  early  as  possible,  don’t  forget  to  remind  me  when  it  is  morning.”  “I  will  sir,  your  pyjamas,  Georgina  kept it  for  you.”  “I  was  almost  sending  for  it.”  Mr  Collins  collected  his  pyjamas  from  me  and  smile  broadly.  “So  squeeze.  Maybe  Georgina  forgot  ironing  it.”  “It  seems,  boss!”  “time  to  pray,  Paul!” My  prayers  directed  against  my  boss  enemies  battling  to  bring  him  down  at  all  cost.  After  our  prayers,  my  skin  sodden  of  sweat.  I  opened  the  refrigerator  two  step  from  me,  drain  water  I  saw  in  a  tumbler.  “Ah,  Paul!  Enemies  around!”  “That  is  life.  I  can  fight  them  for  you!”  “You  are just  a  boy  to  them  because  fetishism  is  all  they  believe  in.”  The  clock  struck  twelve.  We  were  on  bed,  we  slept  opposite  each  other.  “A  slap?  Leave  me  alone!”  “Lazy  boy  get  up  to  do  your work.”  “Sorry  ma’am.”  “You  must  work  early  or  I  reduce  your  salary!”  Hillary  warning  succinct. “Your  boss  just  left  to  work.  Sweep,  clean  everywhere,  dress  my  bed,  avoid  raw  light,  am  I  understood!”  “yes  ma’am!  Only  problem  of  time  for  good  work.”  “Well … as  far  it  is  done  excellently,  excuse  me  a  minute!”  “Wow!  This  woman  must  had  been  a  repented  tigress.  Anyway.”  “Paul.  Paul!”  “Georgina  have  you  gone  insane?  From  wardrobe?”        “I  hid  from  my  boss  wife,  Ah!  am  scared  of  her.”  “Hillary  slapped  me,  I  thought  it  was  you  that  slap  me.”  “Next time,  you  won’t  wake  late.”  “That  was  outrageous!  Mr  Collins  must  hear  this!”  “kidding?  Duties,  performance  is  needed  from  you.  Scrub  easily,  avoid  tearing  boss  rug.”  “You  know  better;  help  me  Georgina.”  “Too  early  for  that.  Give  me  your  brush!  Follow  as  I  do.  First  stage  is  must.  Remove  all  dirt  by  sweeping  away.  That  is  a  map out  for  next  stage.”  “Easy  Georgina.”  “Paul.  Not  as  concluded.  Practice  make  perfect.  In  a  week  time,  Mr  Collins  will  hand  you  your  salary.  For  now ...  be  serious  and  careful!”  “thanks  Georgina.”  “Once  more,  be  careful.”  “I  will.”  “Wait!  Someone?”  “umm ...”  “Paul:  overnight  you  changed,  speaking  to  no  one?”  “prayer  against  all  enemies.”  “When  have  you  become  prayer  warrior?”  “Today.  I  must  not  talk,  am  still  in  mood  of  praying.”  Hillary  shook  herself,  slammed  her  buttocks  to  dissatisfaction,  gradually,  the  wall  brought  out  a  thud.  “Smoke  from  kitchen;  I  guess  ma’am!”  “Follow  me.”   “I  shall  join  you,  am  coming”  “Come  along  with  fire  extinguisher!”  “Consider  it  done  ma’am.”  Hillary  shut  the  room  door.  “Paul  a  ploy.  Why”  “that  is  good.  Now  I  am  free.”  “Panic  wife  of  Mr  Collins,  so  She  is  also  scared?”  “I  trust  Mr  Collins.  Marrying  another  woman  won’t  be  a  difficult  thing  for  him.” “But  Paul.  Ready  with  that  at  your  back.”  “Fire  extinguisher  is  not  needed.  Only  used  in  all  emergency.  I  will  pretend  is  too  heavy  to  carry.  Expensive  joke  as  I  may  say.  She  is  coming Georgina!”  “Again  Paul?  Talking  to  ghost?”  “No.”  “There  was  no  smoke  as  speculated.  But,  I  want  to  see  the  kitchen  clean  as  possible.”  “Okay  ma’am!”  “Georgina  should  had  come  to  accompany  me  to  my  working  place.  Today  marks  ten  years  of  our  office  existence.  Just  like  yesterday!  Lawal  should  be  on  his  way  by  now.  Our  good  driver  with  prowess  in  driving.  So focused.” “Ma’am  I  will  be  through  with  my  work  in  two  minutes.” I  took  along  everything  I  can;  keeping  clean  the  kitchen  won’t  come  as  surprise  to  Hillary.  A  complainant  ready  to  pour  her  anger  on  anyone.  Cobwebs  on  wall,  broom  to  remove  it  off.  Less  than  a  minute  I  was  through.  I  came  back  to  the  room,  Hillary  had  gone.  “Georgina  come  out  from  the  wardrobe  right  now!”       “S-She...  had  gone?”  “yeah.”  “I  overheard  her  expecting  me  back  from  where  I  did  not  go  to.”                                “Is  there  someone  in  this  room?”  “Georgina  shut  that  door!  Someone  is  coming  here.” “David ... he  must  be  the  one.  Tell  him  am  not  around,  be  fast.”  “Say  it  yourself.”  “When  you  knew  David  knows  my  voice.”  “I  won’t.  Maybe  it  is  Hillary  that  is  behind  that  voice.”  “You  can  Paul!”  “she  is  not  right  here!”  I  snapped.  “Georgina  I  got  something  for  you!  Open  and  take  it.  I  believe  this  is  for  you ...!”  David  violently  banged  the  door.  “Stop  that!  Stop  that!  Georgina  is  not  here!”  I  angrily  force  open  the  door.  “Remember  David,  this  is  my  boss  room!”  “Mr  Collins  called  and  told  me  he  is  on  his  way  back  home.  He  said  that  Georgina  should  be  informed  so  that  his  best  native-cloth  will  be  ironed.  Meeting  he  ought  to  have  attended  was  cancelled  while  he  was  almost  getting  to  the  venue.  Paul  try  to  iron  Mr  Collins  native-cloth,  please.”  “Georgina is  experience,  more  experience  to  carry  out  such  specific  task.”  “How  do  we  communicate  her  to  be  fast  before  Mr  Collins  comes  back?”  “very  soon  David;  Georgina  should  be  back  from  Hillary  place  of  work.”  “O,  I  expect  you  to  have  told  me  Georgina  follow  my  boss  wife,  Hillary.”  “Don’t  mind  me,  it  was  because  of  my  confuse  state  due  to  heavy  bang  at  the  door.”  “No  time  left;  I  think  doing  it  myself  will  be  accurate.  Oh,  I  am  gradually  wasting  time.  Just  close  boss  room  door.”  “Yeah  I  will.  Wow!  He  almost  understand  my  trick.  That  guy  is  too  smart!”  “Is  he gone?”  Georgina  asked.  “Coward.”  “How  can  I  thank  you  Paul?”  “never  mind.”  “Come,  have  my  kiss.”  “Kiss?  Has  it  come  to  this?”  “love  affair  between  us,  I  will  say;  besides  love  don’t  cost  a  thing.”  “Think  again;  wrong  decision  of  planning  an  affair  with  me.”  “If  Mr  Collins  and  his  wife  realised  this,  Paul  they  will  support  us  fully,  that  may  lead  to  marriage.”  “Silly,  and  silly  of  you!”  “How  old  are  you,  Paul?”  “stupid  telling  you  my  age.”  “Okay;  do  you  by  mistake  knew  all  your  data  are  kept  under  my  care?”  her  confession  to  me  was  daunting.  “Who  gave  it  to  you?” I  grabbed  Georgina  with  my  last  strength,  she  dangle  for  safety.  “Allow  me!”  She  forced  out.  I    mistakenly  touched  her  boobs.  “Sorry  for  this  Georgina;  is  just  that  you  got  me  angry.”  “You  almost  killed  me,  I  don’t  expect  that  from  you!”  “I  am  begging  you;  forgive  me  Georgina.”  “Paul  think  twice,  I  love  you!”  tears  from  Georgina  won’t  allow  me  to  fall  easily  for  her  cheap  love.   “Let  us  date.  If  you  agree  I  shall  be  checking  you  after  school  hours,  I  promise  you.”  “School?  Don’t  mock  me.”  “This  week,  going  to  school  as  your  aim  will  surely  come  to  pass.  Mr  Collins  and  his  wife  has  something  good  in  mind  concerning  your  case.”  “You  must  be  telling  lies,  tell  me  the  truth  Georgina!”  “It  is  nothing  but  true.”  “That  is  good  news  to  hear.”  “Now:  do  you  finally  agree  to  what  I  want?”  “Never!  Never!  Wherever  my  mother  is,  she  would  reject  that  nonsense  you  want  for  both  of  us.  Something  is  certain;  tears  of  joy  will  flow  from  her  because  of  me  about  schooling.  Though,  if  this  is  a  joke,  I  won’t  take  it  likely  with  you!”  “don’t  you  trust  me  Paul?”  “I  can’t.  You  are  too  desperate.”  Shrillness  far  from  us,  I  noticed  my  boss  was  back,  his  growling  makes  me  realize  he  is  back.  “Very  soon  Georgina,  Mr  Collins  will  knock.  Open  the  door,  pretend  to  be  in  kitchen.”  “Good  idea!  We  shall  discuss  later.”  She  rounded  up. “Boss,  welcome  sir!”  “Paul  you  must  have  been  busy.  I  was  making  call  to  one  of  my  manager in  my  second  company.  No  time  to  waste.  Get  me  my  suit  in  the  wardrobe.”  “The  key  master?” “Georgina  should  be  in  possession  of  it.  Where  is  she?”  “In  the  kitchen  sir!”  “go,  call  her  for  me.”  “Yes  sir!”  “Hurry  up,  my  managers  are  waiting  for  me.”  Georgina  was  in  my  mind;  she  might  had  left  before  I  get  to  her.  Plates  tossed.  Georgina  and  David  may  be  having  a  brawl.  “Georgina!  Georgina!  Give  me  keys  of  Mr  Collins  wardrobe.  He  is  waiting  for  me.”  “Check  your  pocket.”  “Oh,  is  even  inside.”  “Go  before  Mr  Collins  rages.  Be  fast.”  “Did  David  came  here?”     “He  had  sneaked  as  he  heard  Mr  Collins  talking  to  you.  Boss  is  waiting,  Paul  be  fast  please!”                                                                            
                                                                                CHAPTER  THREE                                                                        
Wardrobe  in  Mr  Collins  room  painted  brown.  For  a  stranger  sent  to  the  room;  just standing  front,  he  or  she  might  conclude  it  is  a  vault  where  money  is  stock  for  important  use.  I  brought out  the  key,  push  it  through  for  easy  opening.  Dark,  white  suit,  guessing  which  one  Mr  Collins  prefer  left  me  pulling  out  my  beards.  Wristwatch  to  match  each  suit  lie  below;  I  took  one  fine  wristwatch;  gold-plated  made,  transparent  logo  showing  inside.  My  name  knock  my  head;  I  was  scared  as  if  someone  has  been  watching  me  from  a  close  range.  Stealing  is  something  my  late  mother  hate.  Taking  what  does  not  belong  to  me  is  sin.  I  paused  to  see  if  I  am  being  watch  unnoticed  to  me.  “Paul  bring  me  my  dark  suit.  Also  my  briefcase.”  “Okay  boss!”  Mr  Collins  almost  enter  his  room.  Answer  I  gave  to  him  was  my  saving-grace.  Well  posture  dark  suit  clasp  my  hands.  “Boss,  I  am  coming!”   I  closed  any  side  that  may  be  open,  locked  my  boss  wardrobe.  On  my  way  to  give  him  his  dark  suit,  Georgina  sprinkled  water  on  me,  I  was  shocked,  I  breath  noisily.  “So  it  is  you!”  “who  else  if  not  me.”  “Don’t  wet  my  boss  suit;  be  prepared  to  face  his  wrath  if  his  suit  is  wet.”  “Georgina!  tell  Paul  I  am  waiting  for  him!”  “boss,  just  a  minute!”  I  left  Georgina,  she  eavesdropped  as  she  heard  Mr  Collins  making  a  call.  “Boss,  am  back.”  “You  stayed  so  long,  I  expected  you  to  run  faster;  well,  this  is  exactly  what  I  want.  I  must  increase  your  salary.  Only  you  will  enjoy  that  benefit.”  “Sir,  I  don’t  think  your  wife  will  allow  that!”  “is  there  any  problem  when  I  left  for  work?”  “I  woke  up  late,  your  wife  slapped  me.”  “Paul ... tell  me  the  truth,  was  there  an  argument  between  you  and  my  wife?”  “boss,  it  can’t  happen.  Only  waking  late  caused  that.  I  pray  such  won’t  happen  again.”  “Sorry  for  my  wife  treatment  against  you.”  “Paul  take  this  sealed  envelope  and  tear  it  gently.”  “Welcome  ma’am!”  “tear  it  first  before  welcoming  me!”  “Hillary  even  forgot  her  husband  is  standing  close  to  her.”  Mr  Collins  voiced.    “Admission  to  any  college  of  my  choice?  Is  this  a  fantasy  or  a  dream?  This  is  what  my  mother  want  for  me.  Now  it  has  become  a  reality.”  My  happiness  was  at  its  peak.  “Hillary,  good  you  did  not  tell  Paul  our  plans  for  him.”  “Thank  you  ma’am.  Thank  you  sir!”  I  said.  “I  am  going  back  to  work.  I  came  for  my  dark  suit.”  “Darling  when  you  come  back,  we  shall  discuss  more.”  Mr  Collins  never  worry  of  going  back  to  work  for  his  meeting.  As  the  chairman  of  his  company, he  was  breaking  his  rules  against  his  staff.  “Early  as  possible,  get  ready,  Mr  Lawal  is  taking  you  to  college.  I  have  gone  to  check  how  quality  the  college  I  want  for  you  is.”  “I  have  no  sandals,  school  bag,  books,  biro  to  carry  to  school.”  “Inside  that  polythene,  all  your  books,  biros,  sandals,  bag  you  wish  to  have  is  there.”  “I’m  too  slim  ma’am.  How  can  uniform  size  me?”  “this  slim  uniform  in  my  arm-bag  shall  size  you  to  fullest.  By  the  way:  is  Georgina  around?”  “she  should  be  in  kitchen  right  now!”  “that  is  not  her  place  of  duty.”  “Ma’am  welcome  back.  I  don’t  know  you  are  back.”  “Georgina,  you  hid  from  me;  all  because  of  following  me  to  my  working  place.”   “I  did  ma’am  because  you  have  been  stressing  me.”  Angrily,  Hillary  slapped  Georgina.  Georgina  fell  directly  to  her  back.  “Paul  is  she  dead?”  “I  can’t  say.”  “Call  the  ambulance  before  something happens.  I  am  finished.  Help  me  Paul!  Remove  my  cell  phone  from  my  bag.  Dial  this  number.”   I  dialled  fast  as  possible.  “Not  available!”  “Try  again!”  “Okay.  Is  ringing  ma’am!  Hello  we  need  an  ambulance.  Someone  here  is  injured.  My  name?  I  am  Paul.  From  Mr  Collins  house.  Yes.  Yes.”   “Thank  God  an  ambulance  would  soon  be  here.  Paul  it  is  not  my  fault;  beg  Georgina  for  me.”       Blood  welled  Georgina  body  due  to  falling.  Her  left  eye  seems  it  is  badly  damage.  She  struggled  to  lift  herself  up.  Strength  had  gone  far  from  her.  I  consoled  her.  She  smiled  sourly  to  me.  “Paul  what  on  earth  is  this?  Blood?  Did  something  happen  just  now?”  “Put  off  your  fear;  just  a misunderstanding.”  “By  the  way,  who  did  this?”  “my  boss  wife.”  “Almost  murdering  Georgina!” “an  ambulance  is  on  its  way  here.  she  will  be  treated  when  getting  to  hospital.”  “Georgina  sorry  for  coming  late;  I  could  had  save  you!  Bring  me  bandage  from  that  locker!”  “this  is  it.”  “How  did  it  happen?”  “Hard  to  explain.”  “how  can  it  be  hard  to  explain!”  “Okay.  I  will  tell  you.  Hillary  slapped  Georgina!”  “why!”  “Georgina  expressed  herself  that  she  was  been  stressed  by  Hillary.  That  was  the  genesis;  Hillary  saw  this  as  rudeness  exhibited  by  Georgina.  Margaret  is  here!”  “Any  problem?”  “I  receive  a  call  informing  me  to  come  here.”  “Who  called  you  actually?”  “I  of  course  called  her.  Hillary  my  boss  wife  begged  me  to  call  for  an  ambulance.  I  told  my  receiver  that  this  call  is  from  Mr  Collins  house.”  “Thank  God  they  are  here!”  “Unfair  of  you ... ma’am!”  “please  it  is  a  complete  mistake.  We  shouldn’t  exaggerate  this.  I  have  money  to  give  both  of  you  as  far  this  is  kept  secret.”  “This  money  you  want  to  give  us  as  bribe;  how  much  is  it ...  ma’am?”  I  asked.  “One  thousand  dollars!”  “whoa!  an  opportunity  I  can’t  let  slip  by.  Don’t  you  think  so?”  David  asked.  “An  evil  was  perpetrated  and  you  want  me  to  support  that  by  receiving  money  to  shut  my  mouth.  By  law  I  suppose  to  inform  the  police  of  this!”  “if  poverty  is  your  heritage,  to  be  rich  is  my  target.  Remember  our  suffering  in  Jerry’s  abode.  Have  you  forgot  your  experience  of  eating  swine  faeces?”  “I  won’t  take  that  money.  That  is  betrayal  of  trust  to  Georgina.  Besides,  this  will  tarnish  my  image!”  Hillary  rest  herself  on  the  couch.  She  swallowed  her  saliva.  She  brought  out  her  cell  phone  pretending  of  calling.  “David  this  is  all  the  money  I  have  here.  I  could  have  increase  it.  I  promise  each  of  you  something  more  than  that.”  I  frown  while  kneeling  beside  Georgina.  “She  might  die  if  not  taking  care  of.  Let  us  do  everything  to  keep  Georgina  back  to  her  good  health.”  I  pleaded.  “Journalists  is  here!  how  comes?”  Hillary  inquired  to  know.  “Hillary  Collins  the  regular  guest  on  radio  24 FM,  we  came  immediately  we  were  inform  that  somebody  has  been  murdered  in  Mr  Collins  house;  tell  me  more  of  this!”        “I  want  to  use  this  medium  in  apologising  for  my  behaviour  towards  our  dry-cleaner.  I  am  so  sorry.  This  won’t  happen  again!”  surprisingly,  Georgina  stood  up.  “She  is  not  dead!”  all  the  police  men  screamed.  “This  is  a  case  of  attempted  murder.  Ma’am,  follow  us  to  our  station!”  one  of  the  stern  looked  police  men  ordered  Hillary.  “For  a  minor  offence?”  “Yes  Ma’am.  Your  dry-cleaner  will  also  follow  us  so  that  she  can  write  a  statement  about  you!”  the  other  waiting  police  men  came  in  rush  with  their  clubs  and  whisked  Hillary  away.  Another  car  was  use  to  take  Georgina  to  the  police  station.  “Bye!”  all  the  journalists  present  waved  me.  I  was  so  bewildered.  Only  I  and  David  were  left  alone.  “As  one  family  we  must  rescue  Hillary  from  the  police  men.  David   this  is  all  we  can  do!”  “wrong  boys.  I  brought  them!”  “who?”  “police  men  you  saw!”  Margaret  said.  “I  told  your  mother  I  love  Collins.  Before  that  your  mother  said  she  wants  you  to  be  a  seaman  because  that  was  what  your  father  want  for  you  when  you  choose  your  career  in  life.”  “So  you  were  so  close  to  my  mother?”  “I  and  your  mother  are  close  friends.  For  this  I  must  go  and  bail  Hillary.  Sgt. Okon  is  in  charge  of  attempted  murder  case.  He  flirt  a lot.  My  lips  would  kiss  his  lips  and  that  is  all.  If  proving  stubborn;  my  buttocks  will  sit  on  him.”  “What?”  I  could  not  believe  her  sayings.  “An  harlot?”  “Good  nurse!”  “This  is  out  of  your  ethics  you  knew  that?”  “not  even  the  womanizer  Doctor  can  stop  me.  He  is  so  easy!  My  hot  hips  is  always  what  he likes  most.  Doctor  Phills  the  one  you  knew  is  his  name.”  “Doctor  Phills?”  “Margaret  or  whatever  your  name  is;  if  my  boss  wife  is  imprison  I  must  slice  your  throat.  Try  me  and  see!”  “David  that  is  okay.”  I  begged.  “Stupid  of  Doctor  Phills  I  knew  so  much!      Bringing  himself  low  as  against  his  profession.  David,  Doctor  Phills  was  good  to  my  mother.  I  trust  my  mother,  she  don’t  support  flirting;  Doctor  Phills  could  had  been  advised  if  my  mother  knew  all  this.”  Margaret  sat  worried,  to  her  the  Collins’  would  be  peeved  with  her  petulant  way  of  bringing  the  journalist  when  ought  not  to  be  so.  “Boss!  He  is  back.”  Margaret  pretended,  her  back  faced  Mr  Collins;  she  seems  deserted.  “Margaret  why  have  you  come  to  my  house?”  respond  to  Mr  Collins  question  is  more  of  a  difficulty  for  Margaret.  “I  am  talking,  I  need  an  answer  now!”   Margaret  sprung  from  where  she  sat,  adjust  herself  and  smile  tensed.  “Hug  me  my  love!”  she  demanded.  “Look  Margaret,  leave  my  wife  alone!  Have  I  not  pocket  you  with  ten  thousand  dollars  for  you  to  stay  clear  from  my  wife?”  “my  love,  loving  you  won’t  end.”  Mr  Collins  gently  remove  his  dark  sunny  specs,  rub  his  head,  and  spit  anger,  he  put  on  his  dark  sunny  specs.  “I  have  just  dropped  anger  out  of  me,  luckily  for  you  to  have  not  take  a  share  of  my  anger.”  Margaret  grumbled,  fix  her  wig  on  her  head.  “You  surly  woman  get  out  before  I  call  the  police  against  you!”  “last  thing  to  do;  I  believe  you  can’t!”  “David  I  receive  a  call  from  Sgt. Okon  informing  me  of  my  wife  in  cell;  can  I  be  brief  on  what  happened?”  “Georgina  has  a  little quarrel  with  ma’am!”  “my  wife?”  “yes  boss!”  “Not  so ..!  my  love.”  Margaret  snapped.  “Your  wife  Hillary  try  to  kill  Georgina  after  a  small  argument.”  “I  was  told  you  brought  an  investigative  journalist  to  my  house.”  “I  did  that  out  of  ignorance.  I  still  love  you  and  I  want  you  back!”  “understand  this  Margaret,  it  is  over  between  us!”  “I  will  blackmail  you  and  your  wife  if  that  is  the  only  option  of  getting  you  back!  When  I  aborted  my  pregnancy  you  thought  all  was  over? this  is  best  time  to  seek  my  revenge  against  you  or  your  wife.  Look  at  you;  how  can  anyone  believe  this  is  the  most  powerful  chairman  of  various  companies  shaking  like  a  rat  beaten  by  cold.”  “Shut  up!  Boss:  let  me  handle  her  myself!”  “out  of  it,  David!  I  was  single  when  we  were dating  but  now  I  am  married;  that  signifies  I  am  different  from  before.  In  two  days  time  come  to  my  office  I  shall  give  you  any  amount  of  money  you  want.  Promise  me  my  wife  won’t  hear  this.”  “Millionaire  begging  a  nurse?  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  I  love  that!”  “boss  your  wife  is  back!”  “Go  after  her!” The  police men  rush  out  from  their  cars,  one  of  them  handcuffed  Margaret  hands.  “Game  over!  I  won.”  Hillary  said.  “Georgina  feeling  good  now?”  “I  feel  okay.  A  confession  boss;  can  I  make  it?”  “Why not.”  “Boss,  Margaret  gave  me  some  money  to  poison  your  wife.”  “My  wife?”   “I  told  the  police  men  all.”  “Why  refusing,  telling  my  wife  from  onset?  If  not  that  my  wife  was  arrested,  you  will  conceal  everything  from  me.  I  can’t  trust  you.”  “Forgive  me  boss!”  “Georgina  we  planned  it.”  “No.  Say  the  truth  Margaret  and  let  devil  be  ashamed!”  “take  her  away.”  Heavily  armed  police pushing  Margaret  into  the  car.  “Wait!”  she  yelled.  “Collins  this  is  not  fair.  Save  me  I  don’t  intend  going  to  jail.”  “Go ... leave  my  wife  alone.”  Margaret  was  immediately  taken  away.  “Hillary  forgive  me;  all  this  while  I  have  not  open  my  past  to  you.”  “Weird  to  hear.”  “As  your  wife   I  must  forgive  you.”  “From  now  onward,  no  external  affairs  anymore.  I  won’t  keep  late  at  night.  I  must  take  you  to  any  night  club  I  go  to  if  you  insist.”  “Hillary  is  no  more  a  spitfire?  After  cooling  her  head  at  the  police  cell.  What  do  you  expect?”  “people  change  at  all  time.” David  declared.  “Let  us  go  inside  and  have  a  merriment.  In  fact,  your  salaries  are  ready.”  Mr  Collins  said.  Georgina  smiling,  her  deep  cut  on  her  head  shows  how  severe  her  wound  was.  Hillary,  first  to  enter  inside;  oldie  music  to  excite  Mr  Collins  to  dance  blast  out  from  the  standing  speaker.  “Prepared  to  celebrate  my  victory  against  that  harlot.”  Hillary  announced.  “Paul  I  heard  you  talking;  during  that  time  my  spirit  has  gone.  Everywhere  change  when  I  fell.  I  could  remember  hearing  David  talking  about  a  thousand  dollars.  Tell  me  more.”     “I  can’t  recall  what  you  heard  Georgina.  Sorry  to  say  it  was  a  guess  out  of  your  mind.  Yeah!”  “Paul  think  twice  and  tell  me;  when  my  eyes  was  half  opened,  your  voice  brought  me  back  to  life.”  “Georgina,  I  will  say  it  was  not  your  time  to  die;  to  me  you  were  almost  dead.  If  it  were  the  best  time,  then  nobody  would  had  save  you.”  “Sit  on  that  chair.  Hillary  is  preparing  rice  and  stew;  today  is  a  good  day!  Ready  to  dance  with  me  after  eating.  All  of  you!”  happy  Mr  Collins  announced.  Normal  indoor  work  stopped.  I  ran  inside  my  room,  rub  my  face  with  white  powder. I  dust  off  my  body.  Ran  back  to  parlour  In  readiness  for  celebration.  Food  serve  on  our  table;  Hillary  so  fast  in  preparing  it.  “I  prefer  rice  and  stew  mix  with  salad;  it  gives  me  strength  when  I  eat  it.”  “David  I  also  like  it;  not  only  you.”  “Disco  time.  Finish  eating  all  of  you  and  join  me  and  my  wife  to  dance.  I  dance  very  well  when  I  was  in  Amsterdam.  I  go  clubbing,  but  I  don’t  bring  ladies  to  where  I  lodge.”  As  Mr  Collins  finish  talking  he  embraced  Hillary  as  he  noticed  Hillary  about  to  say  he  was  a  liar.  “Boss  is  getting  a  bit  older  and  he  has  no  child  of  his  own.”  “I  think  you  must  be  the  one  he  would  see  as  his  child.”  “Funny  of  you  Georgina;  it  mustn’t  be  as  you  think.”  Freedom  can’t  be  trade  for  anything  other  than  it.  As  one  family  eating  same  time  is  rule  we  must  all  follow.  Mr  Collins  stop  showing  his  skills  of  dancing.  He  quickly  alert  his  wife  so  that  both  of  them  can  join  us  to  eat  such  a  delicious  food  on  the  large  table.    “Alarm  in  my  wristwatch  must  be  informing  me  of  something.  O,  today  is  my  birthday.  How  I  wish  mother  was  here;  she  must  be  extremely  happy  to  experience  it  with  me.”  “For  the  fact  that  your  mother  is  not  here  I  can  be  your  mother  eating  alongside  you.  I  am.  I  am.”  “Good  to  hear  that.  As  I  clock  a  year  older,  best  food  I  can  say  I  have  tasted  is  this  delicious  one.”  “Umm!”  nobody  was  left  out  in  surprise.  Eating  squalid  food  to  mark  my  birthdays  had  now  be  a  thing  of  past.  “More  food  available  in  pot  in  case  if  any  of  you  is  not  satisfied  as  I  am  seeing.”  “Look!  flowers  inside  my  food.”  “Bush  boy.  Lettuce  is  what  they  call  it.  Now  you  know!”  “That’s  okay.  That’s  okay  both  of  you  must  end  that  harsh  conversations  or  else  it  must  turn  into  another  thing.  Am  I  clear?”  we  answer  as  I  and  Georgina  shook  our  head.  “Sorry  for  that  boss,”  I  said.  We  all  finish  in  satisfactions,  I  stood  up  and  pack  all  our  plates  to  kitchen.  “Now  you  are  back.  Congratulations  Paul  on  your  birthday.  You  are  such  an  honest  boy  hard  to  find  anywhere.”  “Cheers!!”  I  was  too  happy  all  along,  an  housekeeper  like  me  treated  with  dignity.  Fast  enough  for  Hillary  to  dance  while  we  watch  in  mood  of  celebration  galore.  The  music  was  on  as  we  all  dance  happily  on  a  hot  afternoon.  I  again  remember  my  parents  as  we  were  all  dancing.  Georgina  inquire  to  know  my  reason  of  stopping  suddenly.  I  lied  I  am  just  having  a  little  headache.  Mr  Collins  carried  away  by  interesting  beats  coming  out  from  the  music.  “Can  you  dance  Conga  music?”  “simple  to  try  but  don’t  laugh  when  I  am  dancing  anyhow.”  I  roll  myself  to  the  floor  stood  up  in  high  esteem.  My  long  sleeves  fold  up  quickly.        I  clapped  noisily.  Stretched  myself  back  to  floor  while  resting  on  both  hands  and  feet.  “That  is  not  Conga  Paul!”  “Can  you  please  teach  me  how  to  dance  that.  Since  you  know  better  than  me.”  “I  have  had  that  name  couple  of  times  but  I  believe  is  music.  Dancing  it  is  impossible  to  try.”  “We  are  okay  for  the  day;  everyone  can  go  and  rest,  you  can  all  sleep  as  well.  By  this  time  tomorrow  my  boy  Paul  would  have  been  back  from  college.”  Hillary  already  fast  tired;  Boss  was  showing  her  way  to  room.  “Where  is  David?”  “sleeping  undisturbed  in  his  room.  He  prefer  sleeping  than  being  among  everybody.”  We  both  push  my  room  door  open.  Georgina  crashed  on  my  bed.  She  knew  I  am  angry  and  I  want  her  out  immediately.  Quietly,  she  crawled  to  sleep  on  rug.  Happiness  express  from  her  shows  how  interesting  the  rug  was  sleeping  on.  I  lain  face  up.*                                                                                                                                                                                                   “First  day  in  school  will  be  so  weird  to  me.  What  do  you  think  of  that  Georgina?  Am  waiting  for  your  response!  Asleep?  Just  now?  Only  me,  Well:  time  for  me  to  also  sleep;  wake  up  and  go  to  college  for  the  first  time.  College day!”  “Open  your  booklet  for  me  to  see  if  you  are  right  or  wrong.  Please  be  faster.  The  invigilator  is  coming.”  “Give  me  some  minutes  Sandra.” “Paul  stand  up.  Give  me  reasons  you  chooses  to  talk  while  writing  your  examination.  I  said  stand  up!”  “I  ask  her  if  she  has  an  eraser.”  “You  must  be  out  of  your  mind.  Sandra  stand  up.  Is  there  any  objection  to  his  explanation?”  “No  sir.”  “Therefore  you  are  both  guilty  of  internal  examination misconduct.  Severe  punishment  for  both  of  you!”  “Objection  sir!  We  did  not  cheat  while  writing  our  exam.  Reconsider  and  give  us  last  warning.  We  won’t  try  that  again.  Trust  me,  trust  me  sir.”  “Hello  class:  something  might  be  on  between  Sandra  and  Paul.”  “Whoa ...!”  “Shut-up  and  write  your  examination;  I  don’t  want  noises  from  class  I  am  invigilating.  Now  sit  both  of  you.   When  you  are  both  through  come  and  see  me  in  my  office.”  “Yes  sir!”  “Class  silent  please.       Any  problem?”  “Through  sir!”  “now  come  forward  and  submit  your  answer  booklet!”  “I  forgot  writing  my  name  on  my  booklet.  Let  me  do  that  faster.”  The  examinations  was  too  tough  for  me.  I  now  can  see  what  led  sweats  to  soak  my  uniform  on  me.  “Through  Sandra?”  “Yes  Paul.”    “Sir  I  got  something  in  my  mind  I  want  to  say.”  Students  in  the  class  were  already  tired.  As  if  they  were  expecting  me  to  distract  Mr  Steve  attentions.  “Mr  Steve  is  calm,  gentle  and  very  nice.  Cooperation  is  needed.  I  am  not  saying  we  should  cheat.  Do  your  best  and  leave  the  rest.  Steer  clear  from  cheating.”  “Sandra  did  you  have  a  word  for  us?”  “Paul  is  right  I  think.  He  is.                                        He  is.  Look  at  us  again  we  are  one!”  Sandra  want  me  to  have  an  affair  with  her.  I  never  expect  her  to  expose  herself  so  cheaply.  Mr  Steve  want  more  explanations  from  Sandra  as  she  said  we  are  one.  Unexpectedly,  Billy  stubborn  boy  in  class  jump  forward  to  hear  more  from  Sandra.  “Sandra  is  the  girl  of  my  dream.  Many  times  I  wash  her  uniform.  I  clean  her  sandals; plait  her  hair.  She  is  mine  Paul.  Class:  Paul  is  taking  what  doesn’t  belong  to  him.  I  can’t  concur  whatever  he  says.  Will  you  all  help  me?”  my  mother  had  already  told  me  to  be  calm  when  provoked  to  anger.  “You  are  a  liar.”  Sandra  rages  to  Billy.  “Don’t  you  ever  say  that  again.  You hear  that?  I  have  nothing  in  common  with  you.  Look  elsewhere  and  find  a  girl  that  will  match  your  status.”  “Can  you  see  Sandra  is  fit  to  be  with  Billy.”  “Paul  you  are  perfectly  right  for  saying  what  I  have  been  expecting  from  you.”  “Billy  hold  her  left  hand!”  “Okay  Paul.”  “Now  lift  it  up.”  “Hurray!  Hurray!!”  all  students  in  class  so  happy  seeing  troublesome  Billy  beside  the  girl  of  his  dream.  “God  forbid;  with  my  servant?  I  bought  every  of  his  needs.  Billy  is  serving  me. Look  for  yourself.  Billy!  Clean  my  sandals  for  me.  Now!”  Stupid  fool  never  knew  Sandra  was determine  mocking  him.  He  use  his  socks  to  clean  Sandra’s  sandals.  “That  is  good.”  New  boy in  class  expressed. “I  enjoy  this  I  haven’t  seen  in  my  former  school.  This  is  good  I  love  it.”  “Go.  Go  back  and  sit.”  Mr  Steve  was  perplexed.  “Sandra  is  it  true  both  of  you  had  been  dating?”  Sandra  spread  her  palms  on  her  face;  began  crying.  Billy  pleaded  with  her  to  stop.  My  worries  is  that  I  can’t  warn  Billy  to  free  Sandra.  “Okay  I  have  question  to  ask  in  midst  of  everybody.  Really?”Mr  Steve  eager  to  know  more  of  Billy  and  Sandra.  If  what  he  is  seeing  is  nothing  but  the  truth  then  Sandra  has  case  to  answer  in  Mr  Steve’s  office.  “Class  submit  all  your  scripts  immediately.”  I  left  the  class  taking  all  my  books  with  me.  Sandra  also  follow  me  as  she  sobbed.  “Paul.  Paul.”   I  pretend  having  stomach  ache  so  as  to  avoid  Sandra.  Disillusioned  can  affect  my  studies  if  not  properly  looked  at.  Family  I  left  behind  left  a  wide  vacuum  in  my  memory.  I  thought  of  them.     Mr  Collins  a  nice  person  to  live  with;  I  still  baffled  a  person  like  him  still  exist,  I  was  fortunate. 
 “Sandra  why  calling  my  name  in  pretence?  Leave  me  alone.  I  deserve  not  to  be  bothered.”  “Is  it  because  of  what  Billy  said  to  the  whole  students  in  class?”  “no.”  “Then  cheer  up  and  put  on  a  warm  smiles.”  “Of  course  that  is  part  of  me,  Sandra!”  “not  what  I  see  with  my  naked  eyes.”  “Billy  is  right  person  for  you.  Go  meet  him  along  before  he  start  to  look  for  you.”  “I  guess;  you  both  are  heading  to  the  buffet.  I  can  follow  any  of  you  if  you  want  me  to  join.”  “Billy  it  occurs  to  me  you  want  to  know  where  Sandra  and  I  are  going  to.”  “Wrong  to  say  that  Paul.”  Sandra  hold  herself  when  Billy  appeared  suddenly.  Enough  words  is  required  to  chase  Billy  away.             “I  need  some  money.”  “For  what  Billy?”  “just  give  me  if  you  have  little.”  “Money  on  me  is  for  taking  a  snapshot.”  “Can  you  lend  me  my  friend?”  “this  is  a  pranks  you  both  are  trying  to  initiate.  I  know  this  will  happen.”  “Swallow  back  your  statement;  I  need  you  to  apologise  for  derogatory  statement  against  me  in  particular.”  “Sorry  Paul,  I  fail  to  control  my  anger.  It  is  as  a  result  of  this  idiot  Billy!”  “Sandra  he  has  done  nothing  wrong  to  you.  Billy  is  funny  all  around  places  I  have  seen  him.  Entertainment  is  in  him.”  “Oh.  You  want  to  say  he  was  entertaining  everyone  in  class?  He  made  an  embarrassment  of  me  in  class.  I  won’t  take  it  likely  with  him.”      “The  money  I  need  from  you  Paul  is  for  buying  gifts  to  Sandra.  I  have  hurt  her  feelings.  I  did.”  “Lend  the  poor  boy  money  he  need.  If  it  is  not  available  tell  him  you  don’t  have  it  right  now.” “Don’t  think  I  am  poor  Sandra.  I  got  asset  that  can  buy  everything  you  need  including  you.”     “O,  tell  me  what  type  of  asset?”  “my  natural  knowledge.”  “Silly.”  “You  can’t  say  I  am  silly.    Have  it  in  mind  that  I  am  the  only  person  helping  you  during  the  time  of  tests  and  exams?”    “It  is  normal  to  do.”  “From  now  henceforth  it  won’t  be  normal  again;  Billy  shall  feed  you  with  information  you  need  during  exams.”  “Paul  change  your  mind.”  “What  again  you  still  expect  me  to  do.  Sandra  understand  I  have  tried  enough  for  you.”  “No  Paul.”  “Then  what  again?”  “help  in  exams.”  “Read  your  book  and  pass.  That’s  all.”  “I  am  sorry  Paul.”  “Sandra  we  shall  see  again.”  “Sandra  why  worried  when  happiness  is  not  far  from  you.”  “Listen  to  him.”  “He  is  disturbing  me when  he  knows  we  are  both  talking  together.”  Billy  blew  out  air  in  tension.  Discussions  not  favouring  him  bring  an  uneasy  calm  on  him.  “Why?”  “Any  problem?”  “Billy  is  shedding   tears.”    “Is  it  true.”  “Yeah.  Why  snubbing  him?”  “Billy  sorry  for  that.”  “His  tears  has  dried  as  you  beg  him.”  “I  can  join  as  well?”  “No.  Wait  for  me  over  there.”  “Sandra  let  us  end  this.  Follow  Billy  to  where  he  wish  to  take  you  to.”  “Paul  succumb  to  my  demand.  That  is  all  I  need  during  exams.” “Tomorrow  we  shall  discuss  this.”  “Goodbye  Paul.”  “Take  this  money  Billy;  I  want  you  to  smile.”   “Going  home?”  “straight  to  the  library  for  research  work.”  “We  see  again  when  back  with  my  Sandra.”  “See  you.”  “Hey!  Hey!”  “where  is  that  voice  coming  from?”  trees  beside  the  library  were  shaking.  Only  me  walking  alone  to  library.  The  wild  breeze  flow  around.  Despite  how  scorched  the  sun  was.  Nothing  stops  sand  on  floor  to  be  hot.  “It  is  me.”  “I  can’t  see  you ...”                “Here  closer  to  you.”  “Is  this  a  game?”  “Here!”  “What?”  “Sandra  sent  me.  Come  immediately.”    “My  assignment  to  the  library  is  yet  to  be  completed.  When  I  finish,  believe  me  I  shall  be  on  my  way  to  where  you  want  me  to  meet  you.”  “Can’t  you  forfeit  that  for  a  moment?”  “Not  even  a  million  cash  can  lure  me  away  from  achieving  my  aims  in  life.  Time  for  school  business.  Am  sorry  other  time.  See … you.”  “Okay  Paul:  Just  show  up  anytime  you  wish.  Be  hasty  come  to  school  buffet.”  “Hold  my  books  Billy.”  “Why  so  heavy?”  “That  is  the  price  of  working  towards  success.”  “Another  means  is  possible  not  this.  Is  unbelievable  Paul.”  “Billy  no  shortcut  to  achieve  greater  success  in  life.  Read  as  you  can  so  that  failure  won’t  be  yours.”  “Thanks  for  your  advice. From  tomorrow  differences  will  show  on  me  concerning  my  future  in  this  college.  Believe  me.”                                                                                                                                                   “Billy  wait,  can  I  trust  you?”  “Paul  when  you  get  there  you  will  see  Sandra  waiting  anxiously  for  you.”  “Okay  no  time  to  waste   let’s go!”  I  take  a  quick  look  at  Billy;  his  school  trouser  were  well trimmed  as  if  he  knew  the  day  is  his.  “Hello  Billy!”  the  sitting  students  in  the  school  bus  eager  to  see  Billy  their  usual  mentor.  While  moving  the  bus  stopped  and  all  the  students  forced  out  to  shake  Billy  one  after  the  other.  “Thanks.  Thanks  I  won’t  stop  appreciating  you  all!  My  fans love  me.  How  do  you  see  that  Paul?”  “So  interesting  to  see.  Is  it  just  because  of  today’s  drama  in  the  examination  hall?”  “Of  course.  That  has  never  happen  before.  I  broke  an  history.”  “Sandra  over  there!  Why  so  much  gathering  in  buffet?”  “Mr  Steve  had  promise  to  wait  till  you  arrive  and  join  us.  I  didn’t  want  to  inform  you.  I  want  to  take  you  by  surprise.”  “Surprise!”   “Paul  we  have  wait  so  long  for  you.”  “Sir  permit  me  to  say  I  am  about  to  be  mock  again.”  “Thinking  otherwise?”  “for  the  fact  that  I  can  see  all  my  classmates  here  I  will  say  something  funny  had  been  planned  when  I  wasn’t  here.”  “Like  what  Paul?”  “Billy  and  Sandra  should  have  a  clue  about  that.”  “Think  so?”  “I  might  not  be  wrong  about  this  Sandra.”  “That  is  enough  Paul.      Actually,  my  wife  gave  birth  today  that  was  the  reason  everyone  in  your  class  gathered  around  me.  Forty  years  of  marriage  had  given  me  my  first  child  I  would  not  have  Imagine  as  doctors  says  I  am  impotent.”  “You  proved  them  wrong  sir.”  “Of  course  I  was  right  from  onset.  Nothing  is  wrong  with  me.  I  shall  forever  be  happy  of  this.”  “I  am  so,  so  happy!”  “sit  for  your  food  to  be  served.”  “My  reading  today  is  cancelled  I  must  go  to  library  tomorrow  as  early  as  possible,  yeah!”  I  watch  with  calm  as  all  my  classmates  eat  happily.  Billy  sat  close  to  Sandra  watching  me  as  if  I  am  about  distracting  him  from  eating  his  food.  My  food  was  delayed  due  to  late  preparation.  “Exactly  the  food  in  my  boss  house.  The  same  scent  every  time.”  “Any  problem?”  “Georgina  it  was  a  dream  about  school  I  am  yet  to  be  in.”  “Boss  sent  for  you.  He  require  you  to  prepare faster.  Remember  today  you  will  be  in  college.  Mr  Lawal  is  fully  set  to  take  you  to  school  now.”  “My  school  wear  is  not  ironed.  How  do  I  do  now?”  “trust  me  Paul  it  had  been  ironed.  Smile!” “Thank  you  Georgina.”  “When  you  get  to  school  a  uniform  must  be  given  to  you  today,  okay?” “Good  to  hear  that.  I  am  on  my  way  to  the  bathroom.”  As  I  splash  massive  water  on  my  body  I  began  to  feel  cold.  From  the  north,  the  cold  is  faster  to  team  up  with  southern  wild  cold.  Bathing  very  late  can  cause  pneumonia  I  have  no  option  but  to  make  a  determination  of  waking  myself  up  day  by  day.  Mr  Lawal  scared  me  as  he  shouted  my  name  to  alert  me  of  his  readiness.  “I  am  about  joining  you  shortly  Mr  Lawal!”  “Paul  be  hasty  before  he  leave  you  behind.  Okay!” “Time  is  too  short.”  “Mr  Lawal  must  be  so  angry  anyway  he  can’t  complain  to  avoid  dismissal.”  “Yeah.  Fully  ready.”  Boss  wait  anxiously  for  me  in  happy  mood.  His  curiosity  take  me  back  as  I  remember  how  I  was  as  well  curious  about  my  father  I  longed  to  see.  “Happy  day  for  you  today.”  Hurriedly  I  flung  myself  to  the  waiting  car  Mr  Lawal  was.  Looking  myself  from  mirror  inside  the car  I  became  scared.  Odd  look  from  me  downgraded  my  courage  to  experience  first  school  life.“First  day  for  you.”  “How  did  you  know  Mr  Lawal?”  “By  your  dressing.  Your  collar  is  not presentable  kindly  adjust  it.”  “O  let  me  see  what  I  can  do  to  adjust  it.  I  don’t  like  any  tie.”  “But  now  you  can’t  escape  to  wear  it.  Your  school  uniform  that  would be  given  to  you  is  with  tie.”  “How  to  adjust  it  is  a  problem  Mr  Lawal.”  “Wait  let  me  park  the  car  and  help  you  to  adjust  it.”  “Park  here  Mr  Lawal.”  “Police-men  around  if  I  parked  wrong  you  can’t  notice  them  until  an  offence  is  committed.”  “Here  Mr  Lawal.”  Easy  for  my  boss  driver  to  knot  my  tie.  “Now  you  can  call  yourself  a  student  not  a  tout.  Nice  to  see  you  this  way.”  “If  not  you  many  students  will  mock  me  today.  Something  bad  is  prevented  in  my  first  day  of  school.”                                                                                                                                                                 “Be  prepared  I  am  almost  getting  to  your  school.”  I  pant  as  the  word  came  out  from  Mr  Lawal’s  mouth.  “Get  down  hurry  up.  Students  right  now  are  in  assembly  ground  you  can  catch  up  with  them.”  “I  am  perplex  to  see  large  numbers  of  students.”  “Take  away  your  fears  Paul  and  join  them  in  assembly  or  else  you  shall  be  punish.”  “A  new  student  never  know  what  late  coming  is  all  about.  For  this  I  will  be  childishly  pardon.”  “Too  early  to  make  a  judgement  on  your  own  case.”  “No  time  to  talk  more  on  this;  I  need  to  be  among  my  fellow  students.  Bye.”   “I  shall  come  to  lift  you  home  Paul.”  “Where  should  I  stay  in  wait?”  “outside  school.”  “Okay.”  Mr  Lawal  drove  speedily  to  meet  up  with  my  boss.  On  way  to  assembly;  I  was  shaking  as  I  walk.  It  was  as  if  I  was  the  person  all  the  students  had  been  waiting  for.  Thunderous  claps  to  my  direction  almost  push  me  down.  How  to  come  up  with  an  idea  of  silencing  them  became  my  prime  target.  “I  am  one  of  you.”  “Hey  new  student  keep  your  mouth  shut  or  else  I  shut  it  for  you.”  Bullying  is  around  the  corner;  in fact  muscular  students  were  beside  me  making  me  look  like  grasshopper.  “New  student  can  you  scratch  my  back  for  me?”  I  pretend  as  if  I  am  deaf  as  I  was  asked  to  do  what  was  not  right  for  me.  “You  heard  me.”  “Here  to  learn  not  to  serve  my  mate.”  “O,  ready  to  receive  my  blow.”  “Please  know  me  and  let  us  be  friends.”             “I  don’t  want  to  know  you,”  he yells.  “Students  go  to  your  various  classes,”  the  announcing  prefect  commanded.  “Expect  me  in  your  classroom.”  “Am  new  and  I  don’t  think  you  can  know  my  class.”  “Whoever  dares  with  me  pay  through  his  or  her  nose.”  I  left  him  while  he  was  still  barking  to  get  me  at  all  cost.  A  tall  slightly  slim  man  walked  past  the  narrow  ground  linking  to  each  classroom.  He  looked  at  me  and  make  a  low  tone.  My  attention  to  know  the  man  worry  me.  “He  is  the  person  in  my  dream.  A  teacher!”  Circuitous  prefects  finish  talking  and  each  grin;  hold  whips  checking  shabby  dressing.  “New  here?”  “Y-Yes.”  “Tense  this  morning  just  like  that.” “Maybe  Billy  threatened  him  that  is  reason  of  him  nervous.”  A  prefect  closer  to  me  said  openly.  “Paul  Collins  The  headmaster  need  to  see  you  right  now  in  his  office.”  “It  is  Billy’s  fault  not  mine.”  “Not  that. The  headmaster  want  to  give  you  new  uniform  and  show  you  your  classroom.” Immediately  I  heard  that  I  prayed  not  to  be  in  Billy’s  class.  “Pray  to  your  God  not  to  be  in  Billy’s  class.  That  boy  is  a  bully.  Expelling  him  is  something  difficult  for  the  school  authorities  to  do.  He  breaks  students  head  for  fun.  I  will  prevent  that  from  happening  to  you.”  “How?”  “If  the  headmaster  ask  me  to  go  and  count  number  of  students  in  Billy’s  class  I  shall  tell  him  that  class  cannot  occupy  another  student.  That  means  going  to  that  class  will  be  almost  impossible.”  “O.”  “Headmaster  is  coming!”  Paunch  tummy  headmaster  with  his  bald  head  bracing  forward  happily;  lot  of  files  equipped  his  stressful  hands.  “Good  morning  sir. Good morning sir!”  I  greeted  him;  he  never  answered.  “Follow  him.”  A  prefect  ordered.  I  catch  his  office  and  entered  slowly  with  him.  “Paul  Collins  where  are  you?”  he  shouted.  “Already  at  your  office  sir.”  “The  Collins’  are  a  known  family  so  therefore  you  are  also  known  as  one  of  their  own.  You  are  acting  different  from  the  family. Which  class  were  you  in  your  former  school?”  “never  been  to  school  all  my  life.”  “Wow! Can  you  cope  in  any  class?”  “of  course  sir.”  “School  conduct  is  from  this  pamphlet.  Take  this  keep  it  with  you  always.  Rules  and  regulations  also  exist  there.  Fighting  in  school  is  a  serious  offence.  We  had  expelled  numerous  students  fighting.  Billy  is  next  we  are  targeting  henceforth.   You  may  know  who  he  is  later.  Mr  Collins  is  good  friend  of  mine  calling  me  time  to  time.  Most  people  believe  Mr  Collins  and  I  are  twins.  Take  a  look  at  me  we  are  alike.  So  you  are  my  son.”                      we  are  not  alike  for  even  a  second.  I  wondered  if  Mr  Stingy’s  eyes  is  clear.  I  waited  for  my  boss.  Mighty  textbooks  on  Mr  Stingy’s  table  shows  he  may  be  a  bookworm.  He  smiled  at  me.                                                                  
“But  sir,  who  told  you  that  I  am  son  to  Mr  Collins?”  “your  resemblance  is  answer  to  that.”       “A  worker  in  his  house ... can  never  be  his.”  “My  handset  is  always  ringing,  who  is  on  line  now? When  I  finish;  I  want  to  hear  what  you  are  about  telling  me  Paul  Collins  my  son.  Who?  Who?”  “It  might  be  my  boss.”  “Mr  Collins  is  on  line.  Hello  Mr  Collins,  I  can’t  hear  you  clearly. Call  back later.”  Again  the  phone  rang  harshly.  The  headmaster  grudgingly  picked  his  phone  and  answered. “Okay  I’ll  be  expecting  you.”  An  harder  breath  came  from  worried  headmaster  more  enough  to  sent  me  shivering.  “Take  this  books  Paul  Collins  and  keep  some  in  your  bag!”  “Mr  Collins  is around,”  the  female  receptionist  mutters.  “Tell  him  to  come  in.”  I  sat  as  my  master  was  around.  A  shrill  voice  came  forward  into  the  headmaster’s  office.  “Is  Mr  Stingy  inside?” Mr  Collins  asked. “Yes.  Standing  before  you  sir!”  school  meeting  is  about  to  be  held  it  stopped  as  Mr  Collins  had  come.  Telling  exactly  when  his  discussion  with  Mr  Stingy  would  end  is  not  easy  to  just  predict. “Mr  Stingy  my  boy  is  here,  please  take  care  of  him  before  I  come  back  from  overseas!” “Congratulations  sir.”  Mr  Stingy  excited  as  he  heard  overseas.  He  is  aspiring  to  be  there  one  day.  “It  occur  to  me  meeting  is  about  to  commence  here  but  my  coming  had  prevented  that.”  “Mr  Collins  my  brother,  happy  to  be  with  your  son.”  “Oh  my  Paul?  He  is  my  housekeeper.”   “Gentle  boy  indeed  my  brother.”  “Well  Mr  Stingy  I  should  be  on  my  way  to  airport.  Take  this  money.  This  money  would  be  enough  for  Paul’s  schooling  fees  for  each  term  spent  here.”    “Thank  you  boss,”  I  said.  “My  boy  Paul  when  I  come  back  from  my  trip  I  want  to  see  you  in flying  colours.  Avoid  troubles  when  it  comes.”  Unbelievable  to  me  myself  seeing  me  crying  all  along.  “But  boss  for  once  you  never  told  me  you  would  be  heading  to  overseas.  How  can  I  cope  without  you?”  “Paul  feel  bad?  From  look  of  things  I  want  you  in  school  boarding  house so  that  Hillary  won’t  stress  you!”  “but  boss  how  about  Georgina?”  “She  will  run  all  the  work  at home.  Lawal  is  on  his  way  to  bring  your  belongings.  My  regional  meeting  is  to  be  attended  in  Congo.  Lawal  is  here.  Bye  Paul.”  Boss  held  his  golden  briefcase  left  after  talking  with  me.  On  his  left  wrist  a  watch  was  there  to  keep  his  eyes  busy  each  minute.  “Wait  boss!”  “What  again?”  “Take  my  amulet  wear  it  always  to  prevent  you  from  attack  from  your  enemies.”  “Good  wearing  but  so  heavy  on  my  neck.  Besides  I  don’t  believe  in  amulets.”  Mr  Stingy  silent  and  watching.    “Keep  it  with  you  Paul.  Maybe  when  I  return  you  may  give  me  back.”  Mr  Lawal  opened  door  for  his  boss  to  be  in.  “As  usual  boss  early  morning  flight  to  Congo  is  now.  Enter  and  let  me  drive  faster  to  airport.”  It  looked  like  dream  to  me;  no  Georgina  here.  “Paul  primary  three  is  too  crowded.  Only  class  free  is  primary  four.  You  go  there  for  interview.  A  teacher  is  waiting  for  you  there.  Hurry  up  before  he  finishes  with  other  new  students.”  “On  my  way  sir!”  I  ran  out  shut  the  door.  “Where  actually … is  primary  four?  Good  morning  sir!”  interview  had  started  as  I  enter.  “How  may  we  help  you?”  “Mr  Stingy  sent  me  here.”  “O  yes,  for  interview?”  “yes.”      “Did  Mr  Stingy  mentioned  my  name  to  you?”  “No.”  “Mr  Johnbull  is  my  name.”  Wider  eyes  man  with  short  pointed  nose.  Mr  Johnbull  have  an  hectic  days  ahead  for  completing  his  mission  as  new  entrance  students  tests  officer.  “Are  you  prepared  for  your  test?”  “fully  ready  to  write  it  sir!”  “Come  over  here  take  a  sheet  write  your  name!”  while  writing  I  turn  every  second  to  look  if  at  all  Billy  is  in  that  class  pretending  to  write  same  tests  with  me.  Billy  is  unpredictable  since  he  had  promised  getting  me  at  all  cost.  I  faced  down  doing  all  my  best  to  excel  in  my  tests.  One  important  mission  easy  for  me  accomplishing  is  in  this  college.  My  second  mission  is  ahead. “Time  up.  Submit  your  tests  I  want  you  all  to  wait  for  your  result.”  Mr  Johnbull   paused  gaze  through  each  answers  of  each  tests  submitted  to  him.  “I  don’t  need  to  mark  it  merely  seeing  your  answers  I  can  say  the  rights  and  wrongs.  Sit  here  wait  for  results  to  be  announce  by  no  one  else  but  me.”  My  laps  fidget  restlessly;  fear  difficult  to  do  away  with  began  tormenting  my  state.  Most  new  students  sitting  by  my  side  never  worry  as  defending  all  what  they  wrote  is  certain  to  make  themselves  calm.  Mr  Johnbull  moody  to  announce  what  he  might  call  poor  results  merely  from  his  face  one  can  say.  “Only  five  students  passed  excellently.  For  now  we  now  have  our  class  four  students.  I  shall  paste  their  name  for  everyone  to  see.”  We  rushed  to  see  only  five  students  name  pasted.  “My  name!  My  name!”  “if  your  name  is  not  there  come  again  next  time  to  write  another  tests,”  Mr  Johnbull  said.  “Who  is  Paul  Collins?”  “Here  sir.”  “You  scored  the  highest  mark.  Now  follow  me  to  headmaster’s  office  for  confirmation.” I  never feel  scared  rather  my  boldness  was  more  pronounced.  On  reaching  Mr  Stingy’s  office  my  smiles increases  bit  by  bit.  “Paul  Collins  I  may  say  I’m  proud  of  you.  First  time  someone  from  a  rich  family  passed  an  entrance  tests  here  is  almost  a  decade  ago.  History  difficult  to  break  is  broken  by  no  one  else  but  you.  Congratulations!!”  “thanks  for  that  sir.”  “School  boarding  is  ever  ready  to  welcome  you.  Holiday  can  take  you  home.  Without  that  reaching  home  is  not  permitted.”    “Mr  Johnbull  take  my  son  to  class  four. Make  sure  he is  comfortable  there,” Mr  Stingy  expressed.  Stress  is  much,  that  led  Mr  Johnbull  dashing  his  eyes  and  pushing  his  rounded  tummy  forward  which  can  be  mistake  for  a  garbage  can.  Gravity  stretched  our  feet  to  class  waiting  for  me.      Billy  held  his  waist  in  wait;  standing  front  of  class  four.  I  pointed  my  finger  alerting  Mr  Johnbull that  Billy  wants  to  deal  with  me.  Stupid  of  him,  he  rejected  the  claim.  All  students  arose  when  Mr  Johnbull  enters.  “I  hope  you  have  all  prepared  for  my  class.  General  studies  is  good  to  hear, enjoy  it  more  and  more.”  Conversations  among  students  present  makes  class  four  a  drama-place.                                                       “Silent.  Total  concentration!  I  need  a  student  to  shed  more  light  about  continent  he  or  she  is  representing.”  Noise  from  onset  seized;  I  kept  head  down  thinking,  waiting  for  a  rescuer.      “Raise  your  hand  up  if  having  anything  to  say.”  From  my  seat  I  show  up  courage  stood  up.      “Yes  Paul  Collins  anything  to  say?”  “Umm ... Africans  are  more  known  with  their  dark  race.  We  all  belong  to  that  category.”  Mr  Johnbull  clapped  in  appreciation  to  my  explanation  he  accepted. “One  day  Paul  Africans  pride  will  be  you.”  Billy  smashes  desks  beside  me  out  of  quick  anger.        “Class  this  is  Paul  Collins  know  him  very  well  from  today.”  A  girl  came  shaking  hands  with  me.   “I  knew  this  face  somewhere.”  “Me?”  she  forced  out.  “Sorry  if  I  may  be  wrong  saying  so ... .”  Her  name  eager  for  me  to  ask.  “Your  name?”  “Sandra.”  “This  is  too  much  for  me  bearing.      You  were  in  my  dream  last  night.”  “What  role  did  I  played  in  your  dream?”  “you  were  a  burdensome  to  me  Sandra.”  “That  is  enough  Paul  Collins.  Billy  can  you  shed  an  explanation  on  how  British  succeeded  in  colonizing  Nigeria?”  “Difficult  to  remember  sir.”  An  embarrassing  laugh  spread  across  quadruple  corners  of  our  class.  “Unserious  boy.  Instead  of  researching  you  find  pleasure  in  fighting.”  Though  Mr  Johnbull  shows  his  dissatisfaction  concerning  how  daft  Billy had  expressed  himself  but  he  never  let  that  to  weigh  him  down.  “I  should  be  ending  this  teaching  for  now  and  attend  to  Paul  Collins.”  Mr  stingy  already  waiting  for  me.  I  ran  catching  up  with  him  making  it  easy  for  me  to  be  handed  my  key  to  my  room  I  will  be  staying.  “I  don’t  know  my  room  sir!”  “go  meet  that  prefect  over  there  he  shall  assist  you.”  My  heart  beat  reducing  my  faith  in  prefects.  “Your  belongings  had  been  with  me  for  over  two  hours.  Paul  Collins  we  pray  you  enjoy  room  that  is  free  from  violence.”  “Me?”  “that  is  our  college  receptionist  calling.        Go  and  meet  her  she  got  something  to  tell  you.  Make  sure  you  must  listen  to  her  very  well.”                 The  college  receptionist  never  complained  I  wasted  her  time.  She  gladly  welcomed  me  smiling.                    
                                                                                 CHAPTER    FOUR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
“Paul  every  of  that  you  need  I  will  show  it  to  you.  Just  follow  me.”  Floor  facing  hostel  I  was  walking  to  with  the  school  receptionist  present  a  smooth  look  to  any  guest  coming  there  for  first  time.  “Right  here  Paul!”  “too  big  to  stay,  only  me?”  “put  away  your  surprises.”  “Okay  if  you  say  so.”  Unnoticed  to  me  I’m  alone  in  midst  of  amazement.  “This  is  magnificent.  I  won’t  even  imagine  me  a  poor  boy  can  stay  in  room  prepared  for  me.”  I  check  round  anything  I  can  focus  on.  Parading  hangers  all  signals  for  pickup.  “So  neat!”  stream  of  books  piled  up.  Idleness  difficult  to  engage  in  as  each  books  can  flush  out  lackadaisical  thoughts  in  my  room.  Strange  to  switch  on  the  light.  My  palms  search  about  to  switch  on  fluorescence  above  me.  “I  got  it.”  A  knock  on  my  room  door  dried  my  boldness;  I  shifted  myself  and  climb  a  cemented  slab  below  window  in  my  room  to  watch  who  might  be  knocking.  “I  hope  is  not  Billy!”  I  watch  calmly  as  I  noticed  a  woman  I  suggested  might  be  school  messenger  alerting  everyone  to  gather  themselves  to  eat  at  the  school  buffet.  I  came  down  from  top  immediately  opening  my  room  door  to  speak  with  her.  “Are  you  only  one  occupying  room-9,”  she  asked.  “Yes.”  “He  must  be  rich.”  My  only  neighbour  from  room-8  said  eagerly.  “I’m  Michael  my  trusted  friend  Jonathan  is  coming  here  very  soon.  If  you  need  help  knock  my  door  close  to  you!”  “Your  class?”  “O,  primary-six.”  “That  is  great.”  “Time  is  against  us.  We  must  go  together  to  school  buffet  to  eat  my  friend.  What  is  your  name?”  “Paul.”  “No  surname?”  “Okay.  Paul  Collins.”  “You  must  be  from  a  rich  class.  Room-9  is  only  for  three  students.”  “Wow!  How  lucky  I  am.  Only  me.”  “Hi ... Paul!”  “Sandra!  You  also  have  a  room  closer  to  me?”  “not  too  closer.  OO!”  “What  is  wrong  Sandra?”  “Something ... Painful.”  An  expression  of  pain  and  inward  concentration  altered  the  pale  contours  on  her  face.  “Please ...  tell  me.”  “Can  I  follow  you  and  Michael  to  school  buffet?”  “Of  course  we  need  you  there.  I  know  that  place  is  right  place  for  you  to  tell  us  that  painful  thing  you  wish  to  narrate.”  Quickly  we  were  at  school  buffet  sitting  alongside  other  students  watching  TV  and  some  were  cracking  jokes  to  entertain  everybody.  “Someone  want  me  dead!”  “how  did  you  come  up  with  that  Sandra?”  “I  was  bathing  when  the  light  went  off.  As  if  that  is  not  all.  I  heard  an  heavy  bang  at  the  bathroom  door.  Scary  voices  all  around  me  unbelievable  to  me  I  slept  due  to  fear  of  been  lynched.”  “Can  we  have  a  serial  killer  in  this  college?”  “is  possible  Paul  Collins.”  “Why  can’t  you  confirm  who  it  was  from  room  next  to  you?”  “I  did  that  but  I  got  an  encouragement  to  be  free  from  premonition.”  “When  only  you  again  in  your  room  did  you  hear  another  voice?”  “No.  Worst  of  all  is  red  inscription  boldly  written  on  my  doorway  which  say: —Beware  of  me  Sandra.”  I  gaze  at  Michael  quickly;  passion  coupled  with  sorrows  embraced  his  state.  “Service  of  a  clergyman  is  needed.  If  none  of  us  can  find  that  in  this  school  definitely  we  must  engage  ourselves  in  night  vigil  to  avert  calamities  to  come.”  “Jonathan  you  will  be  leading  us  when  we  gather  together  to  pray  in  my  room.”  “No ..  All  we  need  is  strong  faith  to  brace  us  up  for  a showdown  with  that  unwelcome  night  guest  disturbing  Sandra.”  From  far  I  could  feel  my  name  been  called  by  the  unknown.  “Quiet.  Quiet.  Who  must  be  that  person  calling  my  name ...?”  “It  is  me  you  fool.  I  now  get  you  Paul.  This  time  no  escape  not  even  from  this  sorts  of  cowards  by  your  side.”  Billy  and  his  gangs  of  same  categories  were  more  daring  to  us.  “Paul  I  beg  of  you  challenge  me  in  midst  of  your  friends.”  “Please  Billy  this  is  not  right.”  “Oh.  If  that  is  what  you  will  say  tell  me  while  you  have  guts  to  answer  Mr  Johnbull’s  question!”  “I  answer  that  out  of  ignorance.”  “Ignorance?  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!”  Billy  excited  to  unleash  vengeance  on  me  as  I  pleaded.*   
Michael  cautioned  Billy  of  school  procedure  so  as  averting  disobeying  school  rules  when  in  angry  mood.  “We  are  here  to  eat  and  not  to  fight.  Billy  come  eat  with  us  as  one.”  “Sandra  stay  away  from  this  matter  I  don’t  want  to  injure  you.  I  guess  you  had  nothing  against  me.”  “I  know  but  if  Paul  offended  you  as  it  may  be,  report  him  straight  to  our  headmaster.”  “If  not  for  Sandra  believe  me  Paul  I  could  have  give  you  what  you  deserved.”  “I-I  know.”  Billy  together  with  his  gangs  left  us  as  we  still  shivers  while  he  had  gone.  “Thank  God  nothing  evil  happen.  Besides  we  must  be  lucky  since  nobody  even  knew  what  was  going  on.”  “See  students  going  back  to  their  hostels.  We  have  to  join  them  before  Billy  comes  here  again  this  time  he  might  be  back  to  kill.”  Choruses  around  our  ears  from  each  already  satisfied  students  getting  back  to  school  hostels.  I  intended  joining  them  to  sing  any  song  I  can  remember  as  I  was  still  staying  with  my  late  mother.  Lovely  music  began  as  I  led  fellow  students  on  an  hot  day.  “Here  finally!”  “Sandra    within  a  second  I  smell  here  to  be  place  we  were  allocated  to.”  “Open  your  room  door  Sandra. That  person  always  scaring  you  must  be  caught  now!” we  were  in  after her  room  door is opened; their  laid  uncommon  silence.  Minute  later  the  fan  breeze  make  rattling  noise  as  something  is  clutching  its  blades.  “This  fan  again?  I  disconnected  it  as  I  haste  leaving  my  room.”  “Sandra  is  it  spirit  that  is  controlling  the  fan?”  “help  me  I  refuse  to  take  this  anymore!”  “Prayer!  Prayer!   Only  solution  as  challenges  surface!”  Jonathan  usher  us  in  mood  of  prayer.  We  ended  as  Sandra  thank  each  of  us  before  shutting  the  door.  Evening  hijacked  such  an  hot  afternoon  as  it  won. Alone  in  my  room  I  wept  as  my  late  mother  came  into  my  memory.  So  many  books  to  read  stopped  me  from  shedding  lonely  tears.  Patched  brightness  quickly  turned  night  as  I  watch  while  laying  flat  on  mattress  with  four-corner-stand.  Heat  shorten  my  breath  that  encourage  me  to  pull  off  my  body  wears.  School  guards  talking  as  they  walk  with  their  shiny  duty  torches.  I  peep  through  the  window  near  bed  I  lie  on.  Four  owls  flew  as  they  landed  on  cemented  heap  below  window  of  my  room.  “This  is  exactly  what  might  be  disturbing  Sandra  while  alone  in  her  room!” Concern  I  have  for  Sandra  growing  so  large.  I  felt  worried  since  she  may  be  powerless  to  face  her  oppressors.  I  step  down  from  top  of  four  corner  stand  which  was  holding  me  from  downing. Metal  chair  nearer  me  played  host  to  a  lot  of  books  as  I  checked  only  book  related  to  what  I  wish  reading.  “Continent  countries  represent.  I  love  this  one.  Mr  Johnbull  can  challenge  me  in  class.  I  must  read  what  he  likes.”  Tiredness,  yawning  weakened  me.  “How  I  wish  I  can  still  look  through  the  windows.”  I  lost  kip that  is  part  of  me.  Hours  of  reading  caught  short  by  cock-crow.  I  stood  up  to  watch  those  usual  voices  of  students  heading  variously  to  their  classes.  Horizontal  exercises  down  the  field  became  an  interest  rather  than  delay.  Jonathan  jog  really  strengthen  all  small  courage  within  me.  Grubby  state  never  make  students  jogging  ashamed.  I  wave  from  far  still  not  even  one  person  can  sharply  recognise  me. I  angrily  grunted  as  I  sat  thinking  of  the  day  tasks.  I  swept  the  floor;  as  a  former  housekeeper  I  learnt  ways  of  sweeping  faster  despite  how  horrible  your  broom  might  be.  School  bell  jingled  three  times  ahead.  I  prepared  myself  so  clean. School  bag  coloured  in  Navy  blue  hanging  on  my  shoulders.  Teachers  already  teaching  subjects  of  specialization  in  their  fields.  “Good  morning  Mr  Johnbull.”  I  humbled  myself.  “Paul  Collins  I  am  disappointed  in  you  for  your  late  arrival  in  class!”  “Hungry  is  cause  of  it.”  My  class  was  in  complete  ecstasy  as  I  entered  to  sit  on  my  chair.  Mr  Johnbull  continue  his  teaching  as  I  rested  my  head  on  the  desk.  “Georgina  bring  the  food  or  else  I  will  faint.”  “Paul  Collins  stand  up!”  “Sorry  sir  for  sleeping.”  “Okay  apology  accepted  but  tell  me  who  is  your  source  of  help?”  I  tapped  head  of  mine  as  I  ponder  for  an  answer.  Mother  is  still  close  pal  I  would  never  forget.  
“The  Collins’  are  my  recourse.  I  will  give  them  best  gifts  within  my  reach.  That  is  to  excel  in  my  studies  here.”  Mr  Johnbull  pinched  his  nose,  he  became  baffled  to  see  how  serious  my  face  is.  Our  day  is  interesting  as  students  minute  after  Mr  Johnbull  asked  me  my  source  of  help.  Class  work  that  is  ten  marks  went  to  two  of  us  in  primary  four.  Five  subjects  for  that  day  ended  as  I  took  the  day.  Closing  hour  I  shook  myself  more  ready  another  day  to  clinch  another  marks  in  class.  Now  tired  as  I  got  directly  to  my  room.  Assignment  first  is  what  I  figure  out  for  solution.  Sandra  had  knocked  my  door  violently;  I  refuse  allowing  disturbance  alongside  me.  Sandra  left  since  I  never  allowed  her  in.  Books  of  interest  lie  on  floor  waiting  so  that  it  can  be  read.  An  envelope  under  the  room  carpet  make  me  to  write  a  letter  to  Mr  Collins  in  Congo.  “Hillary  too  need  this.  Georgina  I  won’t  write  you  any.  You  shall  see  me  unexpectedly  believe  me  I  still  remember  help  you  had  given  me.”  I  ran  to  take  a  shower  as  I  penned  the  last  written  word.   Just  a  short  rest  took  me  to  another  brighter  day.  I  finished  as  usual,  eat  and  hurried  to  class.  Assembly  ground  seems  tough  as  I  can  see  no  students  even  blinking  their  eyes.  “Line  straight,”  senior  prefect  in  charge  ordered.  I  recede  as  line  extended.  Strict  looked  prefects  gathered  far  distance  from  us  as  if  they  had  something  against  us.  Mr  Stingy  watched  our  line, shook  himself.  It  occur  to  me  that  morning  is  worst  day  he  ever  experienced  as  a  school  headmaster.  He  alight  to  addressed  us.  “Since  8:oo  I  had  been  waiting  patiently  now  you  all  came  at  your  own  time.”  Grumbling  in  an  apparent  disagreement  from  the  students  make  Mr  Stingy  to  be  more  angry. “This  days  things  change  from  something  unexplainable:  when  I  was  like  you  students  I  am  very  smart.  How  do  I  say  of  you  people?”  noises  around  alerted  each  prefects  as  they  punish  us  one  after  the  other.  “Let  them  back  to  their  classes.”  Mr  Stingy  remark.  As  I  step  into  my  class  I  urge  everyone  to  pray  for  a  good  moment.  Class  that  almost  look  like  classroom  of  breeding  hooligans  became  class  of  prayer  warriors.  Mr  Johnbull  sat  at  back  chair,  join  us  praying  as  I  appreciated  his  courage.  Prayers  ended  exactly  10:00;  sweats  soaked  my  uniform  than  anyone.  “How  are  you  all?”  “fine  sir!”  “have  yourselves  on  your  chairs  as  I  teach.”  “So  weak  Paul.  Eat  this  little  bread  I  have  with  me.”  “Sandra,  Umm ... good  of  you.”  Teaching  materials  positioned  in  case  an  example  is  needed.  Mr  Johnbull  started  lowly  thereby  giving  us  hope  his  teaching  may  end  up  becoming  interesting.  We  enjoy  his  subject  than  any  teacher  that  had  taught  us.  The  school  bell  jingled  signalling  it  is  time  for  another  teacher  to  come  into  our  class.  “I  think  my  period  is  over  for  today.”  An  unfriendly  man  adjusting  his  specs  walk  in  without  saying  his  name.  Mr  Johnbull  laughed  broadly  and  left.  Billy  raise  himself  up  to  ask  question  from  the  man.  We  were  fully  ready  to  support  him  if  he  is  punish  just  for  his  inquisitiveness.  “I  teach  general  studies  but  I  practise  tourism  as  an  hobby.”  “Sir.  Sorry  interrupting  you.  We  would  appreciate  knowing  your  name.”  Offence  is  best  form  of  defence  so  I  wasted  no  time  to  commit  it  in  presence  of  my  classmates.  “I  am  known  as  a  tourist  around  Africa  and  my  country.  I  am  Mr  Adewale  please  accept  my  apology  for  not  introducing  myself  earlier.”  His  sun  burn  skin  was  only  thing  funny  to  look  at.  “Get  lost  we  don’t  want  you,”  Billy  shouted.  “Be  free  my  students. My  mission  in  a  month  should  be  accomplished.”  Diagram  widely  displaying  map  African  nations  are  radiate  for  us  to  see  as  Mr  Adewale  show  me  first  before  moving  round  the  class  for  open  view.  “Airplane  can  go  faster  than  anyone’s  imagination.  Along  course  of  our  study  we  shall  be  preparing  for  an  excursion  to  excite  you  all.  Read  harder  I  may  say  best  student  in  this  class  will  go.  Five  in  all  will  be  heading  directly  for  that.  In  a  week  from  now  that  place  might  be  paradise  for  the  lucky  student.”  I  sank  deeper  into  thoughts  I  know  that  place  is  my  right  to  be.                                                                                                                                          “Imagine  to  see  yourself  inside  an  helicopter  on  a  free  excursion.”  Weeks  time  from  now  I    believe  I  shall  be  in  an  helicopter  or  an  aeroplane.  We  rumble  to  one  another  as  doubts  were  in  our  minds  whether  Mr  Adewale  was  actually  person  to  believe.  Even  a  drunkard  can’t  say  what  he  told  us.  The  money  to  hire  helicopter  is  point  of  discussion  for  all  primary  four  students.  “Is  there  question  from  any  one  of  you  before  I  leave  this  class?”  we  could  not  even  raise  our  hands  up  to  ask  if  at  all  he  is  serious  with  what  he  promised  our  class.  “You  over  there ...”  I  pretend  as  if  I  was  not  the  person  Mr  Adewale  is  pointing.  “Stand  up  young  man.”   “Paul  it  is  you.”  Sandra  alert  me.  “Paul  Collins  is  my  name  sir.”  “It  seems  curiosity  can  be  seen  on  your  face.  I  can  read  your  mind.”  “Nothing  for  me  to  ask  sir!”  “this  college  is  capable  of  giving  money  so  as  to  support  any  project  we  needed.  I  shall  talk  to  Mr  Stingy  about  this.”    We  ranted  because  it  is  must  for  our  school  to  support  Mr  Adewale  since  he  had  something  good  for  us.  “Is  there  class  monitor  here?”  “No.  No!”  Billy  shouted.  “Paul  Collins  is  brand  new  class  monitor.  He  is  capable  of  that.  I  have  nominated  him.”  Only  Billy  against  my  nomination. He  hissed  while  walking  away  from  the  class  without  saying  excuse  to  Mr  Adewale.  Hot  sun  from  surface  of  the  Louvre  shine  into  our  eyes  unexpectedly  making  our  day  quickly  boring.    Tint  Sun  too  harsh  for  Mr  Adewale  specs,  hence,  he  remove  his  specs  and  left  the  class.  Talk  of  discussion  around  our  class.  A  tall  quiet  boy  whom  I  had  try  persuading  to  be  my  friend  came, ask  if  Mr  Adewale  is  truthful  from  his  words.  Another  thing  he  was  about  asking  was  difficult  for  him  to  say  since  he  stammers.  Such  handsome  look  from  him  will  make  anyone  to  doubt  he  is  incapable  talking  faster.  Mr  Stingy  together  with  Mr  Adewale  addressed  us  as  we  were  almost  leaving  for  break-time.  “It  came  as  surprise  when  Mr  Adewale  told  me  of  the  plan  ahead.  You  all  know  the  plan.”  “Safari  park!  Safari  park!!”  we  shouted.  “Plan  date  is  not  fixed.”  Turn  of  Mr  Adewale  is  my  expectation.  Not  too  long  Mr  Adewale  spoke  confirming  Mr  Stingy  as  truthful.   He  assured  us   he  shall  convince  Mr  Stingy  to  hire  an  helicopter.  “Northern  hemisphere  is  where  our  helicopter  shall  be  heading;  after  that  we  shall  land  in  safari  park.”  “Sir.  I  have  question!”  “Good.  Ask  class  monitor.”  “Is  there  no  region  better  going  to  than  the  north?”  “Umm.  Is  just  better  as  I  have  experience.  Don’t  bother  if  you  pass  my  test  I  know  you  shall  enjoy  there.”       “Another  question.  Please  tell  us  what  is  inside  safari  park  base  on  your  notion.”  “Fine  animals  tamed  for  visitors  to  see  is  displayed  inside  their  various  homes.”  “How  can  we  be  sure  that  animals  is  safe  to  near?”  “perfectly  safe.  Besides,  a  guard  is  ready  in  case  something  goes  amiss.”  “God  forbid.  That  guard  cannot  be  rely  upon.”  “I  disagree  with  you  as  I  have  not  heard  bad  news  of  safari  park  guides  unable  to  perform  their  duties  assigned  to  them.”  “Paul  Collins.  That  is  enough  of  that!”  Mr  Stingy  expressed.  “The  safari  park  is  our  hub  and  abode  in  days  coming.  Paul  Collins  meet  me  in  my  office  if  there  is  questions  again  you  might  want  to  ask.”  Mr  Adewale  cherished  me  more  than  my  classmates. Jealousy  can  be  seen  shining  on  their  faces.  Again  the  quiet  boy  came;  he  told  me  his  name  is  Bravo.  I  stretch  myself  embracing  him  as  my  own.  “Bravo  I  cherished  your  courage  despite  your  agility.”  Sandra  yelled, push  me  back  as if  she  saw  ghost  walking  in  our  class.  “Sandra  what  is  it?”  I  asked.  “Bravo  had  never  talk  in  class.  It  is  miracle  seeing  him  talking  faster.”  “O,  is  that  your  surprise?”  “yeah  Paul  Collins.”  Billy  fold  his  arms  fearfully.  Bravo  is  his  greatest  threat  as  he  now  knows  he  can  talk.  For  so  long  Billy  had  cheated  him.  “This  boy  is  wicked!”  “Bravo  cool  down  your  mind  we  shall  both  fight  Billy.”  If  Mr  Collins  heard  I  fought  he  must  be  disappointed  with  me  when  he  arrive  from  Congo.  Only  me  knew  what  was  hitting  harder  in  my  mind.  Sandra  adjust  her  uniform  looked  at  me  suddenly.  
 “All  humans  have  weak  point.”  “Billy  is  scared  exchanging  punches  when  he  is  being  watched.”  “Paul  Collins  you  had  studied  him  than  I.”  “Is  that  all  what  you  think  Bravo?”  Billy  sat  beside  us  pretend  he  is  reading  just  to  hear  all  we  have  against  him.  His  bunch  of  unserious  gangs  that  have  same  rough  look  as  him  were  busy  smoking  their  cigarettes  happily.  Break-time  hour  is  opportunity  of  discussing  bothering  issues.  Billy  is  not  only  in  my  mind  but  also  in  Sandra’s  mind.  Something  not  too  serious  can  pull  Sandra’s  happiness  down.  Fear  of  night  dangers  is  not  over.  Billy’s  case  is  a  worry  for  her.  Sandra  hate  cheating  not  to  talk  of  limiting  the  defenceless  students  Billy  got  his  fist  on.  “I  got  all  you  need!”  Billy  barked  in  an  apparent  display  of  war.    Heavy  slap  went  straight  to  Bravo  as  students  scrambled  for  safety.  Bravo  retaliated  faster  than  expected  this  led  to  a  complete  brawl  between  Bravo  and  Billy  his  oppressor.  I  sprang  my  feet;  ready  as  I  encouraged  Bravo  not  only  to  fight  for  his  right  but  also  to  report  the  matter  so  that  the  school  disciplinary  committee  will  caution  or  expel  Billy  together  with  his  fellow  gangs.                     “When  I  am  through  with  him,  you  should  be  next  Paul  Collins!”  Billy  gangs  pull  out  knives  from  their  baggy  pockets  to  stab  me.  Sandra  began  shouting  for  help.  To  her  she  believe  I  can’t  defend  her  and  myself.  The  school  balcony  is  that  place  secret  war  was  going  on  Between  Billy  gangs  and  I.  “Stab  him!  Stab  him!”  Again  Sandra  shouted  painfully.  Billy  gangs  seems  to  change  their  minds  against  me.  Bravo  is  that  person  they  want  to  unleashed  terror  on.  “Do  it  now!”  Bravo  stopped  fighting;  shook  his  head  as  if  I  was  going  to  die  in  minutes  coming.  “Very  soon  your  friend  Paul  Collins  shall  be  pronounced  dead.”  Dead  people  are  forgotten  once  years  streamed  memories  of  them  away.  If  I  die  that  would  be  big  sadness  to  the  Collins’.  One  door  that  serve  as  entrance  to  any  class  was  blocked  by  Billy’s  gangs. “This boys  is  my  protection.  For  Paul  Collins  unfortunately  before  I  slice  your  throat  new  class-monitor  is  not  elected.  That  means  I  am  the  new  monitor.”  “Paul  what  can  we  do?”  “Sandra  I  will  overcome  Billy  once  and  for  all.”  Sandra  unable  losing  me  knelt,  pleaded  so  that  I  will  negotiate  with  Billy.  “Sandra  why  crying?”  “Paul  Collins  I  need  your  loyalty.  That  is  enough!”  “Thank  God  I  know  it  is  easy  for  you  doing.”                                                                                                                                                                                           “Paul  Collins  that  is  simple  to  do.”  “Paul  we  can’t  die  here  when  our  parents  think  we  are  in  class  by  now.  Just  be  loyal  for  our  freedom.”  “No.  I’m  ready  Billy.  Attack  me  first!”  Billy  dive  towards  me.  I  twisted  his  hands  backward.  He  shouted  in  pain.  Neither  his  gangs  could  rescue  him  as  he  cried.  “I  surrender.”  Sandra  couldn’t  imagine  that.  “Are  you  sure?”  “trust  me  Paul  Collins!”  Sandra  smiles  difficult  all  her  fear  about  keeping  alive  has  diminished.  “Unbelievable.    Paul  Collins  this  is  true?“  “as  you  can  see  Bravo  it  is  true.  Billy  can  be  defeated!”  Most  students  in  our  class  had  engage  themselves  to  search  for  us.  They  suspect  Billy  about  taking  advantage  of  us.  Jonathan  trail  our  foots;  located  where  we  were  but  refused  calling  my  name.  Students  in  primary  four  rushed  to  the  school  balcony,  held  panting  Billy  for  his  judgement  in  Mr  Stingy’s  office.  While  at  headmaster’s  office  Billy  begged  for  mercy  before  I  narrated  what  happened.  “What  is  the  problem  Paul  Collins?” “It  is  about  Billy sir.” Billy cleaned  his  eyebrows  as  he  stand  as  an  accused.  “What  had  he  done?”  “He  almost  stab  me  sir.” “Stab?”  “I  have  witness  sir.”  “Who  is  your  witness?”  “Sandra.”  “Call  her  here.” Not  long  Sandra  came in  after  I  called  her  from  class.  “Em ... Paul  Collins  your  father  called  from  Congo.”  “What  message  for  me  sir.”  “He  only  ask  of  your  performance  which  I  told  him  you  are  excelling.”  “I  am  happy  to  hear  this  message.”  “So  Billy  murder  is  that  thing  you  aspire  for.”  “Let  me  explain  sir.”  “No  need  for  that.  Stand  here!  I  shall  discipline  you.”  Billy  pinched  his  cheeks  while  tensed.  He  stare  at  wall  clock  backing  Mr  Stingy.  “What  are  you  staring  at  Billy?” “nothing  sir.” “Or  do  you  intend  to  break  it?”                                                                                                                                                                         
Rear  report  comes  unexpectedly  at  Mr  Stingy’s  office  Billy  famous  for  his  notorious  character  and  this  made  him  popular  to  school  management.  “We  almost  expel  you  last  term  if  not  for  the  school  disciplinary  committee  I  could  have  handle  your  case  myself.”  “Paul  Collins  thinks  he  can  offend  someone  and  go  scot-free.”  “Whoa!  I  see  how  audacious  you  can  be.  Until  when  I  give  right  to  you  then  talk.”  Mr  Stingy  left  me  in  his  office  as  I  was  with  Billy  taking  a  cold  look  at  him.  “Paul  Collins  I  will  win.  I  can  manoeuvre  each  files  on  this  table.”  “So  you  want  good  files  change.”  “Fine.  That  is  all.”  “Maybe  that  was  why  I  heard  students  talking  about  an  innocent  boy  that  got  expelled  when  he  need  his  reward  for  championing  the  school  to  victory.”     “Trust  me  I  exchange  that  innocent  boy  file  since  he  refuse  bowing  for  me.”  “Mr  Stingy  won’t  spare  you  when  I  tell  him  this  evil  deed  you  perpetrated.”  “I  shall  get  revenge  if  they  expel  me.  I  will.  I  will.”  “Sorry  Paul  Collins  I’m  back.”  Billy  prostrate  beg  for  mercy  as  he  knew  all  is  not  well  with  him.  Greatest  fear  he  exhibit  is  nothing  more  than  expel.  “Last  parent  meeting  held  was  inconclusive  because  parents  refuse  agreeing  on  stiff  punishment  for  any  problematic  student.”  “This  is  what  you  need  sir.”  “Good  of  you  my  secretary.”  “I  can  assist  you  along  sir.”                                                                                                           Mr  Stingy  brought  sheets  packets  from  his  drawer  gave  it  to  me  so  that  I  will  differentiate  the  sizes.  “Small  packet  means  small  sheets.”  “Yes  sir.”  “Rich  parents  fail  training  their  wards.  Hm!”     “Upbringing  contribute  whenever  a  child  is  spoilt.”  “We  suffer  it  most  when  they  come  with  shady  characters.  School  is  last  option  for  parents  when  children  troubled  them.”  “Sir.  Is  it  bad  contacting  parents  about  their  children  manners?”  “If  school  authorities  do  that  parents  would  behave  calm.”  “Why?”  “they  hate  blames.”  “But  it  should  be  fault  of  parents  having  bad  children  disturbing  school  authorities.”  “In  first  place  we  shouldn’t  have  give  Billy  admission.”       “Forget  the  past  sir.”  “Prefect  even  make  matter  worse.  Yesterday  a  prefect  went  drinking  alcohol  inside  toilet.”  “I-I  will  say  it  is  strange.”   “I  caught  him.  Primary  six  is  his  class.  By  next  year  that  idiot  will  be  in  secondary  session,  what  will  become  of  him?”  “second  chance  is  okay  if  he  is  granted.”  “He  apologise  which  I  forgive  him.”  “Billy  where  is  your  parents?”  “Can  I  stand  up  sir?”  “you  can.”  “M-my  parents  are  in  overseas.”  “Paul  Collins  I  need  your  assistance  kindly  call  Mr  Johnbull  here.”  “I  shall  sir.”  Billy  dipped  his  hands  into  his  narrow  pockets  fully  ready  bribing  his  way.  “Your  money  should  be  big.”  Mr  Stingy  did  not  know  I  hid  beside  his  office  and  eavesdropped.  “$200  is  what  I  have.”  “Billy  add  more  money  if  you  want  me  to  turn  this  case  upside  down.”  “Okay  tomorrow  will  solve  it  all.  I  shall  add  another  $200.” “Good  boy.  Be  sure  no  one  is  briefed  on  this  issue.”  Corruption  is  what  I  dislike  Mr  Stingy  had  mingle  himself  with  Billy.  Now  I  see  reason  that  will  make  me  believe  Billy  is  above  the  law.  I  told  Sandra  all.        Mr  Johnbull  drive  his  sport  car  gently  into  our  school  premises.  I  open  his  door  for  him  which  he  came out  thanking  me.  Sandra  had  warn  me  should  in  case  Mr  Johnbull  asked  me  if I  see  Mr  Stingy  I  should  decline  from  saying  I  saw  him  that  morning.  School  library  open  two  hours  after  school  assembly  I  went  straight  carrying  all  I  need  as  Sandra  accompanied  me.  I  met  a  girl  that  taught  me  ways  mathematics  is  solve  without  giving  you  problems.  She  saw  how  I  battle  for  an  answer.  Sandra  convince  her  I  can  do  it.  Jealousy  sprung  Sandra  to  know  that  difficult  side  so  that  putting  me  through  won’t  bring  second  party.  Lively  vicinity  around  took  off  anger  I  have  against  Mr  Stingy.  “Paul  very  soon  Mr  Stingy  would  be  sacked  from  his  duty.”  “Hallucination  as  I  can  say.”  “He  is  our  acting  headmaster.  The  school  owner  would  soon  be  back  from  Germany.”  Sandra  broke  my  thoughts  when  she  let  me  knew  an  acting  headmaster  is  in-charge  of  the  college  he  can’t  spearhead.  “Is  that  owner  a  foreigner?  I  don’t  think  so.  He  is  an  African.”                                               
“That  headmaster  of  ours  is  fast  to  do  whatever  he  wants  if  having  slight  opportunity.”  I  seems  confused  starting  from  the  moment  I  heard  Mr  Stingy  receiving  bribe  from  worst  of  all  student  in  any  college.  “Big  mistake  for  our  school  owner  handling  this  enormous  college  to  someone  avid.”  “Mr  Thomas  with  his  accent,  a  simple  man  when  addressing  us  very  early  on  assembly  ground.”  Without  coming  in  contact  with  Mr  Thomas  I  have  a  feel  he  should  be  best  college  owner  that  ever  exist  in  this  earth.  “Paul  Collins  you  prefer  reading  here.”  “Sandra  you  also  add  Collins  to  my  name?”  “Is  it  bad?”  “don’t  be  perplex  I  will  say  it  is  because  I  have  never  heard  you  called  me  Paul  Collins.”  “Funny  enough  as  you  say.  Paul  is  Mr  Collins  your  father?”  as  I   enjoy  solving  my  mathematics  I  became  lugubrious.  Sandra  want  an  explanation  from  this  heart breaking  question  difficult  for  me  replying.  “Secret.  Promise  me  you  won’t  reveal  it  to  even  the  ant.”  “Until  permission  is  granted  from  you.”  “Nice  hearing  that  Sandra.  Collins  is  not  my  father.  He  is  boss  I  worked  for.”  “Is  that  why  he  attached  Collins  to  your  name?”  “he  did  it  since  I  told  him  my  father  had  gone  to  Somalia.  Mr  Collins  believed  he  may  be  dead.”  “More.  More!”  “let  us  sit  under  that  tree  Sandra.”  “Yes  most  students  reading  beside  us  may  think  we  are  talkative.”  Our  day  is  interesting  while  discussing  with  one  another.  A  big  stone  heavy  to  lift  is  pushed  forward  by  me  and  Sandra.  Good  seat  as  I  may  say.  We  both  sat  mute  after  exercising  out  strengths.  “So?”  “Charles  son  is  me.”  “Who  is  Charles?”  “an  hustler  working  tirelessly  just  for  his  family.”  “Ouch!”  “hope  is  well?”  “yeah!”  “Sandra  I  ate  swine  faeces!”  “tell  me  the  truth!”           “Jerry  employed  me  as  his  worker  when  he  saw  how  desperate  I  was  searching  for  job  so  that  I  can  raise  money  for  mother’s  hospital  bill.”  “Where  is  Jerry  now?”  “dead.”  “How  comes?̒”  “snake  bite!”  “Jerry  allowed  you  to  eat  swine  faeces?”  “No.  Hunger  that  night  makes  it  easier  tasting  swine  faeces.”  “Paul  Collins  I  beg  your  pardon.  Did  Jerry  chase  you  away?”  “I  escaped  when  he  was  about  punishing  me  more  for  allowing  his  swine  to  escape  from  that  wooden  pen  house.”  “Escape?”  “I  went  far  after  my  father’s  friend  directed  me.”  “To  where?”  “Mr  Collins  his  brother’s  house.”  “I  am  touched!”  “housekeeper  job  I  did  passionately.  Mr  Collins  reasoned  with  his  wife  that  I  should  be  enrolled  in  a  school.”  “New  life  as  I  believe!”  “Work.  Work.  I  became  restless  serving  Mr  Collins.  I  can’t  complain  or  else  his  wife  would  send  me  packing.”  “Can  we  both  stroll  to  watch  basketball?  By  now  it  should  have  started.”  “There!”  “I  said  that.”  Ball  went  into  the  court.  Students  running  on  field  enjoying  warm  weather  brightening  their  day.  “This  is  best  game  for  me.”  “I  prefer  football.”  “Choice  is  hard  making,  with  time  this  basketball  game  would  be  yours  than  any.”  “Hmm.  I  can’t  concur.”  “Hi.  I  trained  all  boys  of  mine  rare  tactics.”      “School  basketball  coach!”  “you  know  better.  I  am  nicknamed  Sammy.”  Sandra  on  hearing  his  nickname  hugged  him.  She  longed  seeing  Sammy.  “That  is  your  favourite  game?”  “Yes  Sammy.”  “How  about  my  gentle  friend?”  “Paul  goes  for  football.”  “Convince  him  basketball  is  for  big  boys  and  girls.”  “Football  brings  honour,  fame  more  faster!”  “Paul  be  among  the  boys.  I  shall  gladly  make  you  more  famous  than  them.”  I  felt  a  surge  of  triumph  run  through  me.  I  focused  on  him  monitor  his  eyeballs;  sincerity  empty  in  him.  If  Sammy  word  can  be  trusted  definitely  him  as   well  should  be  greatest  basketball  coach  ever  existing.  “You  agree?”  “I  would  think  about  it.”  “Hold  this  ball.  Do  as  I  say.”  “Okay  Sammy.”  “Throw  it  up!”  Sandra  did  as  Sammy  ordered  her.  “Perfect!”  “Sandra  pays  more  attention,  Sammy.”  “So  that  is  what  you  bear?”  “yes  Sammy.”  “Fine.  On  Thursdays  meet  other  players,  learn  from  them  as  they  practice  near  the  court.”                                  “Sammy  Should  I  come  with  him?”  “Who?”  “Paul.”  “Why  not,  if  he  wish  following  you,  fine!”                                               “Sammy  expect  me  on  Thursdays  this  exact  time.”  “With  Paul  too.”  Sammy  waved  blankly  at  us.                                                                                                                
“Wonders.  Sammy  want  me  to  join  the  college  basketball  team.  He  can’t  decide  for  me.”  Evening  had  appeared  than  we  expect.  “Basketball  players  all  have  strange  tattoos  on  their  skins.”  “Is  that  your  belief  about  basketball  players?”  “I  dislike  basketball  Sandra.”  “Mr  Thomas  car.  I  said  so.  He  had  arrived  from  Germany.”  Happy  boys  and  girls  smiled  from  outset,  frowned  when  Mr  Thomas  dark  German  car  passed  them.  “Tomorrow  shall  be  a  tough  day  Paul  Collins.”   Birds  flew  to  their  nests.  I  turn  watching  how  jovial  day  ended  very  well.  “Paul  Collins  be  fast  we  should  be  at  our  rooms.”  Trekking  from  field  is  for  once  hard  explaining.  I  checked  my  wristwatch  every  five  minutes  of  walk.  “We  are  almost  close.”  As  I  came  close  to  my  room  I  could  feel  flowing  airs  around  me.  “We  see  early  Sandra.”  Sandra  open  her  room  door,  entered  inside.  “Mr  Stingy  I  smell  danger  around  you.  Your  boss  is  back.”  I  ate  sugarless  biscuits  I  left  in  my  box,  slept  happily.  “Who  is  that?  Is  morning?”  “Open.”  I  took  my  bathe  put  on  my  uniform;  wore  brown  sandals.  “I  have  finished  please!”  Immediately  I  step  out  I  quickly  locked  the  door.  “Assembly  had  started  Paul  Collins.”  Mr  Thomas  was  making  an  announcement  respectively.          I  saw  Mr  Stingy  absolve  in  fear.  “Fellow  students  this  morning  I  ordered  Mr  Stingy  to  expel  a  rude  boy  from  this  college.  Billy  is  what  they  called  him.  He  insulted  me  when  it  came  to  my  notice  he  had  offended  his  seniors.”  I  now  seems  more  happier  when  I  receive  live  news  I  wished  for.  Mr  Thomas  finished  making  his  announcement.  “Sandra  congrats!”  “for  what  Paul  Collins?”  “Billy  is  a  forgotten  student.”  “Remember  he  can  still  buy  his  way  in.”  “Mr  Thomas  does  not  accept  nonsense  for  Billy  it  is  over.”  “Hello  students  when  is  break-time  free  foods  await  everyone  of  you  at  school  buffet.  You  are  all  free  to  your  classes.”  Loud  chorus  make  Mr  Thomas  smiling.  Classroom  already  neat  than  ever  before.  Mr  Thomas  arrival  had  brought  good  changes  we  can’t  explain  just  in  a  day  everything  seems  like  dream  to  me.  While  we  receive  lecture  about  personal  health  the  college  time  keeper  jingled  the  bell.  “Break  time.  Break  time.”    It  was  fun  ending  what  we  should  had  known.  School  buffet  crowded  every  seconds.  Numbers  placed  on  each  seats.  Sandra  sat  closer  me.  “Today  our  oppressor  is  finally  expelled;  I  am  too  happy  Paul  Collins.”  “Which  food  do  you  prefer?”  the  hardworking  known  waitress  asked  calmly.  “General  food.”  “We  never  have  that  on  our  menu  lists.  Every  foods  had  names.  Look  through  the  lists,  select  best  one  you  prefer.”  “Rice  mixed  with  salads.”  Sandra  had  started  eating  hers  before  food  I  ordered  for  was  brought.  “Billy  is  here!”  A  cold  shrill  voice  from  Sandra  scared  me.  Simultaneous  punches  every  inch  around  signals  danger  to  school  buffet  owners  especially. Empty  bottles  of  soft  drinks  smashed  while  used  as  injuring  tools.  Gallant  security  men  fully  alert  took  Billy  away.  “Have  no  fear  as  you  both  eat.  Billy  would  face  full  wrath  of  the  law.” Grey  hairs  she  present  tells  more  of  her  age.  “I  had  been  insulted  by  children  I  can  give  birth  to.” An  indigent  old woman  speaking  lucid  language.  “Your  name  is …”  “Paul.”  “Mrs  Fabian  is  serving  you  now.”  “But  ma’am  your  children  suppose  to  be  assisting  you  whenever  you  are  called  for  assistance.”  I  showed  displease  with  Sandra  statement  towards  old  Mrs  Fabian. “I  married  almost  three  decades  ago  when  love  is  love.”  I  almost  burst  out  massive  laugh  as  I  see  she  is  still  interested  on  love.  “This  work  is  tedious;  most  important  hours  that  I  had  decided  is  for  my  children  is  consume  serving  college  students.”  College  ambience  is  calm  when  Mrs  Fabian  was  talking.  No  order  from  customers  waiting.  I  packed  all  dirty  plates,  spoon,  cups  for  thorough  washing.  The  work  I  engage  myself  into  is  laborious.  Sandra  assisted  me  in  washing  everything  I  packed  to  kitchen.  We  were  through  less  than  an  hour.  “Very  quick  Paul.”  “Is  there  more  Mrs  Fabian?”   “Yes.  I  will  do  that.  Thanks.  You  can  sit,  relax,  listen  about  my  past  interesting  years.”       “Sorry  I  am  about  to  interrupt  you,  tell  us  about  your  husband.”  Sandra  rustle  as  her  desire  was  accomplish  that  is  exactly  what  was  bothering  her  mind.  “Fabian  had  died  for  so  long.”  A  short  sting  surprise  ran  over  me  making  me  to  cough.  Doctor  coming  in  contact  with  me  firstly  would  think  I  am  diagnosed  of  tuberculosis.  “Want  some  water?”  “don’t  mind  Mrs  Fabian,”  I  said.  “My husband  was  a  loving  type  to  his  family  and  our  neighbours.  I  missed  my  Fabian  when  alone!” Keeping  close  eye  on  Mrs  Fabian  one  may  suggest  she  had  been  conned  so  many  times  by  crooks.  “Good  husband  who  performs  duty  of  an  house  wife.”  “Sorry  Mrs  Fabian  I  share  your  feelings!”  “I  lay  on  bed  beside  him,  admire  him  with  praises.  Fabian  keep  bad  friends  around  him.  He  even  got  drunk  often.  Day  came  when  things  began  getting  worst;  Fabian  could  not  take  worst  situations  as  it  come  he  beat  me  mercilessly  in  presence  of  the  children.”  “It  is  unbearable.  I  suppose  appropriate  authorities  should  had  been  informed.”  “Worst  thing  trying  if  Fabian  knows  then  I  am  finish.”  “If  it  is  possible  going  back  to  the  past  I  will  help  you  Mrs  Fabian.”  “You  are  not  born  then  definitely  it  is  impossible.”  “What  were  your  children  doing  when  your  late  husband  maltreated  you?”  “They  cried  pitifully,  as  their  tears  was  on  they  do  what  their  instinct  can  convince  them  doing.  Fabian  legs  were  seized.”  “I  love  that!  I  love  that!” “Fabian  got  angrier  beat  his  children  bruises  were  displaying  on  their  feeble  bodies.”  “Is  your  neighbours  unaware  of  what  was  going  on?”  “I  will  say  our  closest  neighbour  came  out  pleading  with  him  to  stop  beating  his  wife.”  “So  Mrs  Fabian  is  it  death  that  snatched  your  husband  away  that  allowed  you  to  be  a  waitress  in  this  college?”  “It  is  not  as  you  think.  I  can’t  feed  my  children  with  sands.  They  deserved  good  food  from  mother’s  hard  work.”  “Wait  Mrs  Fabian,  is  your  husband  keeping  an  affair  outside  his  matrimonial  home?”  “Yes.  I  remember  my  daughter  inform  me  that  her  father’s  phone  had  rang  continuously.”  “Did  you  told  her  to  give  it  to  her  father?”  “I  did.  She  came  back  telling  me  he  had  slept.”  “I—I  am  heartbroken  Mrs  Fabian.”           “I  read  text  forwarded  to  him.  One  thousand  messages  all  were  about  Love,  nothing  more  else  off  love.”  “If  it  is  me  I  will  wake  him  up.  He  deserved  an  answer.”  “I  did  that.  Fabian  snubbed  me  when  asked  about  that  text  sent  to  him.”  “He  should  be  found  guilty  if  he  is  tried  in  court,”  I  flushed.  “White  shirt  he  wore  was  blotched  with  red  substance  smelling  offensively.”     “I  guess  Mrs  Fabian  it  is  nothing  more  than  lipstick.”  “You  know  right.  It  is  true.” “Affair  with  a  girl.”  “He  is  suspected  for  philandering.  I  refuse  giving  him  his  phone;  mistakenly  I  dialled  one  number  which  later  provoked  him.  The  person  that  answered  me  seems  to  be  his  sugar  girl.”  “Hmm!”  “I  receive  insults  from  her  as  she  believes  it  is  Fabian’s  wife  she  was  speaking  to.  I  almost  ran  mad.”  “Mrs  Fabian  what  you  should  have  done  is to  warn  that  girl.” “I  warned  her  to  keep  off  from  Fabian  or  else  I  will  deal  with  her  publicly.  In  return  she  warned  me  to  get  ready  for  war.”  “Good  men  change  sometimes;  this  experience  I  have  heard  will  remain  fresh  in  my  mind.”  “Divorce  won’t  come  from  him  since  I  will  say,  he  did  not  threaten  you  with  divorce.”  “Fabian  did  that  my  daughter.”  “I  am  Sandra.”  Oh  yes.  Your  mother  knew  best  for  you.  Sandra  fit  you  as  a  name.”  “An  order?  I  can  serve  him!”  “leave  it  I  don’t  want  our  big  boss  wife  to  know  I  don’t  wish  serving  at  this  present  moment.”  Break-time  was  over  all  students  had  left  except  I  and  Sandra.  We  wish  to  hear  what  led  to  the  death  of  Mrs  Fabian’s  husband  that  made  her  hairs  grey  while  having  young  person  skin.  We  dodge  when  we  spotted  dark  car  coming  towards  our  direction.  Under  our  chairs  we  hid  watching  different  legs  passing  us  faster.  “Where  is  Sandra?  Where  is  Paul?  You  could  have  inform  me  before  leaving.”  “Mrs  Fabian  bend  down.”  She  stretch  herself  down,  catching  a  glimpse  of  our  welcoming  eyes.  “Come  out  and  sit.”
“I  hope  no  dark  car  is  cruising?”  “If  there  is  I  won’t  call  both  of  you  out.”  “Mr  Thomas  can  be  unpredictable.  If  he  discover  we  are  sitting  instead  of  being  in  our  classroom  he  will  forward  our  case.  That  means  we  will  be  expelled.”  “I  know  when  he  is  coming.  When  the  sun  is  at  its  scorching  stage  expect  him.”  “Sandra  be  alert.”  “Paul  Collins  don’t  rely  on  me.  Be  as  well  alert.”  “More  food  if  any  of  you  is  hungry.”  “Ah!  As  for  me  I  can  proudly  say  I  am  okay.”  “Selfish  ingrate.  You  forgot  I  am  here.  how  about  me?  You  seems  not  to  be  bothered  Paul  Collins?”  “That  is  enough  Sandra.”  “Silent  Paul.  Silent  Sandra!  Mr  Thomas  can  pass  unnoticed.  Do  you  both  wish  good  for  me?”  “Yes.  you  are  our  school  mother.”  “Em ... as  I  was  narrating,  I  went  reporting  that  matter  to  Fabian’s  friend.  Mr  Kobakoba  followed  me  directly  home.  He  knocked  before  I  open  the  door  and  led  him  in.  Fabian  questioned  appearance  of  his  friend  when  he  did  not  invite  him.” “Sandra  check  your  time  the  sun  will  soon  scorched.”  “Mr  Kobakoba  pretend  I  had  not  tell  him  anything.  I  smell  danger  when  Fabian  walked  his  friend  out  of  his  house.”  I  winked  Sandra  forcefully.  Mr  Thomas  pretend  he  was  making  an  important  call  from  his  handset.  Sandra  knelt  before  Mrs  Fabian  to  beg  if  asked  about  her  presence  and  that  of  mine.                                           Mrs  Fabian  promised  she  must  do  the  undo  so  that  we  will  not  be  expelled  from  the  college.   “I  passed  a  circular  informing  all  prefects  to  chase  unserious  students  away  if  the  bell  is  jingled.  This  two  what  are  their  problem?”  “Yes.  Yes.  she  is  lucky  you  came  quickly.  Sandra  is  battling  with  stomach  ache.”  “Is  that  what  led  her  to  kneel  down?”  “fear  must  be  the  cause  sir.”  “Hey  boy  is  there  also  problem  with  your  stomach?”  “No  sir.  I  directed  Sandra  to  school  clinic  but  she  insist  food  must  be  in  her  stomach  before  heading  to  clinic.”  “I  understand  boy.  Now  Sandra  do  you  prefer  your  meal  serve  in  school  clinic?”  “I  want  Mrs  Fabian  to  prepare  her  delicious  rice.”  “In  school  clinic  my  personal  cook  have  an  office  there.  She  is  a  good  cook.  I  don’t  need  monitoring  her  prowess  of  cooking.  All  I  need  from  her  is  delivering  in  services   she  likes  rendering.”  “I  have  phobia  for  people  I  never  knew.  If  I  eat  their  food  I  can  die  in  pain.”  “Mrs  Fabian  I  must  say  I  am  happy  you  hear  what  she  is  saying.  Tell  me  the  truth,  is  Sandra  really  okay?  Or  did  you  cast  a  spell  on  her?”  “Spell?  Whatever  Sandra  said  is  her  choice.      Stomach  is  sensitive,  therefore  eating  an  unknown  person  food  can  be  dangerous.”  “Mrs  Fabian hold  your  lips!”  “I  will  sir.  If  you  want  me  to  close  my  eyes  I  won’t  hesitate.”  “I  own  everything  in  this  college.  From  this  primary  section  to  secondary  section.  I  decide  for  you  and  your  boss.” “Mr  Thomas  I  beg  of  you,  avoid  telling  big  boss  wife.  As  for  Mr  Babs  he  will  forgive  me.”            I  whimpered  for  Mrs  Fabian.  Dismissing  her  should  not  be  welcome  from  either  side.  “Hold  that  tiny  lips  of  yours.”  “Sir  forgive  Mrs  Fabian.”  “Boy  even  in  Germany  I  don’t  tolerate.  Carry  your  cross  alone.  Mrs  Fabian  is  certain  not  to  escape  this  wrath  of  mine.”  “Stomach  pain!”  Facetious  Mr  Thomas  rub  his  smooth  palm  on  his  cheeks.  “Mrs  Fabian  go  now  bring  some  snacks.”  Sonorous  voice  of  Mr  Thomas  shows  his  passionate  feelings  towards  one  of  his  student.  “Boy   fear  not  Sandra  shall  be  strong  when  Mrs  Fabian  is  through  cooking  sweet  hot  rice.”  Closing  hour  is  drawing  nearer.  Mr  Thomas  try  bringing  an  idea  for  excusing  himself  from  attending  to  Sandra’s  health.  That  is  opportunity  we  wait  for  still  yet  he  find  it  difficult  to  come  out  with   tangible  reasons.  “Sandra  food  is  ready,”  Mrs  Fabian  informed.  “Eat  Sandra.  If  this  food  is  not  properly  cooked  well  tell  me  now.”  “Sweet  meal  Mrs  Fabian  is  too  good  to  be  elevated  as  chief  cook  in  this  college.”  “Chief  cook  I  shall  do  all  within  my  reach  as  Mrs  Fabian  has  bring  full  happiness  for  me  and  all  students.  Ill  health  here  is  something  your  parents  never  expect  for  once.  Mrs  Fabian  expect  your  promotion  letter  from  now.  I  shall  inform  Mr  Babs  right  now!”    
                                                                              CHAPTER  FIVE                                                                                                         
Horn  from  Mr  Thomas  dark  car  make  him  speedy  joining  his  personal  driver  directly  to  college  quarters  which  he  temporary  stay  before  he  heads  to  Germany.  “Is  this  real?  For  long  I  was  sideline  as  big  boss  wife  refused  promoting  me.  Chief  cook?”  “be  happy  Mrs  Fabian.  I  share  this  happy  day  with  you.”  “I  won’t  stop  to  thank  both  of  you.”  “How  can  I  convince  myself  that  it  is  our  school  mother  that  won  for  us.  We  can’t  be  afraid  of  expulsion.”  “Mr  Thomas  know  our  names.”  “Sandra  I  need  the  end  of  Mrs  Fabian  experience  when  she  was  married  before  becoming  widow.”  “Students  had  closed.”  “Leave  them,  besides,  Mrs  Fabian  is  not  complaining  we  are  here  disturbing  her.”  “Paul  Collins  I  wish  to  play  basketball  even  when  Sammy  had  not  give  me  go  ahead  to  join  the  college  basketball  team.”  “From  this  place  trust  me  we  would  both  watch  how  students  are  having  fun  around  basketball  court.”  “Serious?”  “why  not  Sandra.”  “Promise  is  a  debt.”  “Well  believe  me.  Mrs  Fabian  I  apologise  for  any  obstruction.”  “How  can  you?  Have  I  forget  your  contribution  towards  this  success  I  have  today?  The  answer  is  no!”            Sandra  smug  state  allowed  basketball  overtake  her.  “Fire  gutted  our  house  during  that  time  my  husband  is  already  asleep.”  “Oh  God!”  “his  body  burnt  beyond  recognition.”  “Mrs  Fabian  how  much  will  I  give  you  so  that  past  memories  won’t  hurt  your  personality?”  “Sandra  enough  of  that.  She  have  unlimited  freedom  so  avoid  stopping  her!”  “Mrs  Fabian  where  were  you  when  fire  gutted  the  house?”  “away  monitoring  business  I  have.”  “Which  type  of  business  do  you  do?”  “in  future  journalist  should  be  your  career.  Okay  selling  locally  made  cloths.”  “That  is  too  stressful.  Had  it  been  that  positioned  paid  workers  are  hired  by  you  something  wrong  may  not  have  happened.”  “Children  foresee  than  adults,  if  I  have  ability  to  see  as  the  way  they  see,  I  could  have  still  be  doing  business  by  now.  New  business  is  dangerous  entrusting  it  in  employees  hands.”  “Mistake.  Mistake.  Human  is  not  born  to  be  perfect.  Definitely  wrong  must  occur.”   “Sandra  no  one  is  above  mistake.”  “Mrs  Fabian  don’t  be  offended.  How  was  your  reaction  when  it  occurred  to  you  your  husband  is  dead?”  “sympathisers  pass  that  message  when  I  saw  huge  crowds  gathered  around  our  compound.  Atmosphere  thick  of  chronic  smoke  took  over  usual  air.”  I  remove  white  handkerchief  I  reserved  in  small  bag  in  pocket  of  mine,  cleaned  Mrs  Fabian  falling  tears.  “Widow  at  young  age  is  challenging  for  whoever  is  experiencing  it  presently.”                                          “When  boss  is  back  I  shall  assist  you  with  any  amount  I  can  get  from  him.”  “I  appreciate,  but  I  did  not  ask  for  that.”  “Consider  your  children  Mrs  Fabian.  Whatever  I  contribute  can  also  assist  them.”  “Me  too.  When  is  visitation  day  my  father,  a  trained  sailor  is  capable  of  giving  you  money  within  his  reach  if  I  complain  you  need  assistance.”  “I  should  be  satisfied  with  pittance  I  earned.  Five  girls  under  my  care  never  complain  one  day.”  “So  fast?  Time  is  against  us.  We  should  be  prepare  to  watch  basketball  players  practising.”  “How  happy  I  am.  When  I  get  home  the  good  news  I  shall  be  telling  everyone  is  nothing  more  than  Mr  Thomas  promise.  Chief  cook  too  big  for  me.”  “By  tomorrow  expect  I  alone.”  “How  about  Sandra?”  “maybe  she  may  come  as  well.”  “Expect  me  Mrs  Fabian.  Bye.”  Noises  along  road  towards  the  basketball  court  awake  our  spirit  to  high  esteem.  Sammy  voice  can  be  very  funny;  his  instructions  was  demanding.  “Sammy  is  it  today?”  “Thursday  is  not  good  for  my  players.  I  change  their  training  to  Tuesdays.  I  should  have  inform  you  yesterday.”  “Sammy  let  me  spin  the  ball.”  I  became  fascinated  watching  Sandra   swinging  herself  up  in  an  apparent  display  to  challenge  any  opponents.  Sammy  encouraged  other  players,  tapping  them  on  their  shoulders.  Three  hours  training  over.  Hostel  was  waiting  for  us.                                              
I  make  a  patter  on  pediment  fix  to  the  door  of  my  room.  Opposite  me  is  room-8  which  occupy  four  students  of  same  family.  “Can  we  help  you?  Sorry  it  is  you.”  “I  want  to  know  if  intruder     comes,  who  will  be  first  to  know?”  “we  of  course  in  room-8  if  room-9  occupant  is  not  around.”   “That  was  reason  of  me  tapping  room-9  door  so  that  room-8  occupants  can  burst  out  see  for  themselves  that  stranger  knocking  opposite  them.  If  it  is  your  room  you  won’t  behave  strange.”   “I  understand  you.  You  just  want  readiness  in  case  emergency  calls.”  “How  about  other  brothers’  of  yours?”  “trust  them  sleep  had  arrested  their  minds.”  “So  early?”  “their  day  was  tough.”  “I  reason,  mathematics  stress  them.”  “You  also  know?”  “our  mathematics  teacher  Mr  Sagastic  want  each  students  he  ever  taught  to  understand  his  subject.”  “I  had  it  in  mind  I  will  meet  him  one  on  one.  Do  you  hear?”  “hear  what?”  “entrance  examination  to  secondary  is  next  week  I  have  the  form  which  I  filled  just  now.”  “How  do  I  get  mine?”  “go  to  Mr  Stingy’s  office  very  early  when  he  is  in  office.  Tell  him  you  also  want  to  attempt  writing  entrance  examination.  If  he  ask  which  entrance  examination  just  say  the  one  of  secondary.”  “I  shall  do  that.”  “Paul  prepare  ahead  once  and  for  all.”  “Thanks  for  your  advice.  Goodnight  neighbour.”  “Henry  speaking  to  you.”  “Oh  Goodnight  Henry.”  I  leap  up,  push  the  door  fully  open,  close  back  the  door.  Cooking  sweet  rice  exactly  that  of  Mrs  Fabian  is  my  intention.  College  rules  still  stand  cooking  in  hostel  is  prohibited.  “Therefore  this  is  useless.  I  don’t  need  this  foodstuff,  stoves  I  brought  from  my  boss  house.  Food?  Who  brought  this?”  I  check  three  foiled  plate  hot  rice  is  in.  Each  is  having  morning,  afternoon,  night  and  room-9  is  pasted  on  it.  “That  is  good.  Mr  Thomas  had  eradicated  old  laws.  This  new  law  will  save  time,  energy.”  I  pull  drawer  spoons  I  kept  were,  took  one  spoon  remove  the  cover  sealing  the  foiled  plate.  “This  will  be  delicious.”  As  expected   aroma  from  the  food  allowed  me  eat  comfortably.  “One  plate  enough  for  only  me.  This  two  is  waste.”              I  crawl  to  my  idle  mattress.  “Bed?”  Mr  Thomas  countable  reign  had  again  changed  my  room.                                              I  expect  to  sleep  on  mattress  which  is  now  a  decorated  bed.  I  slept  so  early  cock  crow  awoke  me.  Reminding  myself  for  the  necessary  things  is  first  every  morning.  I  bathe  quickly,  put  on  my  uniform,  wore  my  sandals,  buckled  it.  “Fully  prepared.”  Mr  Stingy’s  office  played  host  to  me.    “Paul  Collins  can  I  do  something  for  you?”  “good  morning  sir.  I  came  to  make  an  enquiry  if  I  can  also  collect  the  form  for  the  entrance  examination.”  “Which  entrance  examination?”  “usual  entrance  examination  which  is  mandatory  to  write  for  students  gaining  admission  to  secondary.”                                  “You  trust  yourself?”  “I  do  sir.”  “Boy  where  you  not  the  one  I  saw  at  the  buffet?”  “right  sir.”                                      “Is  Sandra  fine?”  “yes  sir.”  “Mr  Thomas  this  boy  is  a  good  Samaritan.  If  not  for  him  that  girl  may  not  walk  to  eat  at  the  buffet.”  “He  is  son  to  Collins.”  “Collins.  Collins.  I  recall  that  rich  man?”  “he  came  when  you  were  in  Germany.”  “Did  he  ask  of  me?”  “too  hurry  to  even  talk  more. When  Collins  came  here  he  was  on  his  way  heading  for  Congo.”  “Collins  Jnr.”  “Paul  Collins  is  what  I  call  him.  Since  Collins  is  his  father.”  “Right.”  “Take  the  form  fill  it  now.”  I  filled  as  I  was  requested  to  do.  Next  week  dawn  quickly.  I  sat  in  examination  hall.  Wrote  what  I  know.  Mr  Adewale  test  is  next  in  my  agenda.  If  I  do  excellently  well  the  Safari  park  must  be  my  next  destination.  On  reaching  hostel  I  got  an  information  from  Henry  that  in  a  week  time  result  will  be  out.  For  over  six  days  I  had  not  set  my  eyes  on  Sandra  neither  did  she  came  to  check  me.   Reading  in  library  had  denied  me  going  to  class.  All  I  know  is  that  Mr  Adewale  test  cannot  pass  me  by.  Mrs  Fabian  must  have  ask  after  me.  I  won’t  keep  this  a  secret  if  ask.  As  school  mother  she  would  not  wish  bad  of  me.  “hold  on.”  A  bang  gear  me  up.  I  open  to  see  who  it  is.  “Sandra  how  is  everything.”  “Fine.  Your  name  appeared  on  the  list.”  “List  of  what?”  “you  are  asking  me?                                                           
have  you  forgotten  you  wrote  an  entrance  examination?”  “Oh!  I  made  it.  Sandra  rejoice  with  me.”  “Mrs  Fabian  had  already  heard  you  passed  excellently.  She  receive  her  letter  of  promotion as  chief  cook.”  “I  shall  be  in  secondary  section.  I  saw  Mr  Thomas  we  spoke  at  office  of  Mr  Stingy.”  “Mr  Thomas?  He  had  gone  for  his  Masters  Degree  Programme  in  Germany  today.”         “So  quick?  I  pray  he  should  not  stay  for  so  long.  Walk  faster  I  don’t  intend  going  late.”  The  school  sweepers  had  swept  every  floor,  some  were  washing  the  school  toilets,  others  were  cleaning  each  hostels  windows.  “Mr  Thomas  must  had  approve  this  before  travelling.”  “First  time  I  have  witness  such  in  this  place.”  Primary  four  students  discussing  how  one  of  their  own  will  soon  be  forgetting  all  about  primary.  “Paul  Collins  shake  me.”  “Bravo  I  must  do  that  even  if  I  am  stopped.  Bravo  be  the  class  monitor  from  now.”  “Me?  This  is  big  workload.”  “Take  things gradual  as  it  comes.  Secondary  section  is  a  reality  for  me.” “Mr  Adewale  is  in  class  Paul  Collins.”             “No  delay  students,  I  should  be  on  my  way  for  an  important  symposium.”  “Sir  your  test  when  is  it  commencing?”  “any  moment  in  three  weeks  time.  Paul  Collins  active  class  monitor.  Your  class  now  look  spic-and-span.”  “Bravo  is  class  monitor.”  “Is  it  this  naive  boy?”  “Bravo  fully  capable  sir.”  “Class  cooperate  with  your  new  class  monitor.  Besides,  how  did  votes  went  on  his  favour?”                                        “I  voted  him  sir.”  “Paul  Collins  I  am  delighted  on  your  success.  You  alone  passed  from  the  whole  primary  four  class.  I  shall  present  you  a  gift  when  I  return  from  the  symposium.”  “I  wish  you  safe  journey  sir.”  Mr  Adewale  started  his  teaching  by  explaining  how  a  good  environment  should  be  like.  As  it  is  common  of  him  he  drew  a  chart  on  the  board,  our  inquisitive  eyes  fixed  rectilinear.  “Safari  park  has  this  environment  I  drew  on  board  for  all  of  you  to  have  a  view  of.                 Class  work.  Bring  out  your  books .  List  ten  animals  that  is  easily  found  in  safari  park.  I  shall  give  only  twenty  seconds.”  I  created  a  version  of  thoughts;  animals  friendly,  fierce  ones,  I  listed  them  accordingly.  “Paul  Collins  sweats  over  your  body.  Simple  work  to  do.  Hasten  up  I  shall  mark  yours  first.”  “Nine  remaining  one.  This  is  it  sir.”  “Paul  Collins  consumed  thirteen  seconds  out  of  twenty  seconds  given.”  Mr  Adewale  rested  his  head  against  his  shoulder  as  he  smile  while  marking  my  work.  His  smile  shows  I  passed  his  class  work.  “Passed.  Get  set  for  safari  park.”          “Injustice!  Injustice!”  sixteen  students  that  their  work  was  rejected  protested.  “When  I  am  back  I                           should  have  your  luggage  set.”  “Sir.  Is  hired  helicopter  on  its  way?”  “Mr  Stingy  had  arranged  for  it.”  Mr  Adewale  wore  his  hat  on  his  head,  blew  off  dirt  taking  refuge  on  his  specs.  “Have  a  nice  day,”  he  said.  Bravo  snuffled  as  he  notice  Mr  Adewale  had  no  regard  for  other  of  the  students  in  class.  “Paul  Collins  do  what  you  can,  I  want  to  go  to  the  safari  park  with  you.”  “Class  monitor  does  not  focus  on  only  himself.”  This  was  a  hell  of  a  beginning  for  Bravo  as  I  vomit  my  mind  to  him.  “Paul  Collins  it  is  must  for  me  to  be  at  the  safari  park!”  “save  your  last  word  Bravo,”  Sandra  warned.  Four  teachers  taught  us  before  the  time  keeper  jingled  the  bell.  “Smile  Paul  Collins.  In  two  minutes  time  Mrs  Fabian  will  see  you.”  “My  children  is  coming!”  Mrs  Fabian  yelled.  “Sit  here  both  of  you.  As  chief  cook  all  salaries  I  shall  be  receiving  won’t  delay  for  once.”  “Mrs  Fabian  very  soon  I  shall  follow  Mr  Johnbull  to  safari  park.”  “So  Sandra  is  not  going  with  you?”  Sandra  jovial  mood  changed  when  Mrs  Fabian  asked  me  question  I  must  reply.           “Mr  Johnbull  mentioned  only  me.  I  shall  convince  him  when  he  is  back.”  “Bring  their  food!”                                       “where  you  aware  we  were  coming  Mrs  Fabian?”  “I  just  prepared  myself.  This  buffet  I  worked  now  has  another  branch  not  far  here.  Right  after  my  promotion  I  no  longer  cook  but  only  to  supervise.”  “Mrs  Fabian  why  the  noises  around?”  “Football  stadium.  Final  will  commence  exactly  ten.”  “I  apologise,  I  don’t  want  to  miss  little  of  the  game.  I  shall  come  back  with  Sandra.”         We  followed  other  students  at  their  back.  “Take  your  ticket.”  “Any  need  for  this?”  “yeah ...  differentiating  our  students  as  against  other  students  coming  is  the  reason  for  the  ticket  in  your  hand.”  “Sandra  hold  it.”  “Number  nine  seat  for  you.  For  the  girl  number  ten  seat  is  also  free.”    “I  have  heard  of  stadium  I  don’t  even  know  our  college  is  beside  this  enormous  fine  stadium.”  “Large  crowd?”  “So wide.”  The  gaudy  stadium  was  filled  to  its  capacity,  thrilling  songs  of  quick expectation  from  the  welcoming  crowd.  Above  us,  glow  weather  was  unpredictable.  “Jonathan  here  too?”  “I  don’t  want  to  be  told  how  the  match  ended.”  “So  it  is  just  starting?”  “you  came  after  ten  minutes  it  started.  One  goal  to  nil.  Our  college  football  team  is  playing  with  no  experience.  Mr  Adewale  is  our  college  coach.  Look  at  him  over  there  so  worried.”  “Oh!!”  our  fans  shouted  immediately  when  one  of  our  player  was  brought  down.  From  look  of  things  there is  a  flare  among  the  spectators.  “Our  strikers  seems  timid  scoring.”  “Paul  Collins.  I  search  for  you  everywhere.  Mr  Adewale  had  asked  for  you.  Can  you  strike?”  “Strike  what?”  “I  mean  play  as  a  striker.”  “Never  in  my  life  have  I  played  football  not  to  talk  of  playing  in  an  important  match  like  this.”  “Our  school  shall  be  disgrace  if  we  lose  this  match.”  “How  about  if  we  win?”  “each  players  on  winning  side  will  be  sponsored.”  “To  where?”  “football  academy.”  “Go  tell  Mr  Adewale  I  will  try  if  given  the  chance.”  “Wait  for  me  I  should  be  back  two  minutes  time.”  Sandra  is  a  lover  of  basketball  but  she  believe  since  I  prefer  football  than  basketball  I  can  spring  surprise when  tried  on  pitch.  I  left  her  promise  coming  back  after  final  whistle  is  blown.  I  jog  down,  on  my  way,  Michael  stopped  me  while  taking  me  to  meet  Mr  Adewale.  “Paul  Collins  put  on  this  jersey.”  “I  will  coach.”  “Substitution.  Substitution!”  a  worse  performing  player  changed,  I  got  in.   “Paul  Collins  play  well  upfront.”  “I  shall  not  let  my  college  down!”  not  too  long  I  kicked  the  ball  to  my  partner  gusty  rain  pour  violently.  I  became  imperceptible  by  the  opponents.  I  was  ready  in  case  direct  pass  come  to  me.  Direct  pass  came.  “Direct  Paul  Collins!”  my  firepower  goal  silent  the  opposition.  “Good  Paul  Collins.  I  need  more  goals.”  Mr  Adewale  jumped  around,  his  frowns  turn  to  happiness.  Again  ball  was  passed  to  me,  this  time  I  slobber  ten  players  with  evolution  knack,  the  goal  post  was  my  target  which  I  did  without  an  obstruction  from  the  slender  goalkeeper.  “Goal!”  drums  were  wildly  beaten  from  our  college  supporters  club.  Frothy  sweats  all  over  me.  “Latch onto  that  ball  Paul  Collins!”  Mr  Adewale  not  still  satisfied  with  the  two  goals.  My  filmy  posture  never  discouraged  Mr  Adewale  from  onset.  Flawed  and  fickle  human  reasoning  caused  defeat  for  the  opposing  team.  Final  whistle  blown  after  ninety  minutes  of  play. Knickerbockers  worn  by  the  defeated  team  coach  squeeze,  unbelievable  for  the  coach,  he  wept  angrily  against  his  players.  Gloomy  state  all  over  Mangrove  college  players,  supporters,  and  spectators  wishing  them  victory.  Mr  Adewale  ran,  lifted  me  up,  our  college  students  sang  happily.  An  emblem  of  victory  given  to  me,  dignitaries  coming  far  shook  hands  with  me.                                                    The  impartial  referee  shook  my  right  hand  wishing  better  days  ahead  for  me  if  I  wish  playing  football  as  a  player.  “Paul  Collins  gold  trophy  for  our  college;  Mr  Thomas  office  will  have  this  for  anyone  that  want  to  have  a  feel  of  it.”  “First  time  playing,  scoring,  winning  I  can’t  believe  what  just  happened  now.”  “You  can  hear  this?  Paul  Collins  had  not  even  kicked  a  ball  in  his  life  before  playing  today.”  Mr  Adewale  spoke  directly  against  my  team  mates.  “Paul  Collins  is  a  professional  player  that  don’t  need  any  coach.”  Booed  defeated  Mangrove  college  players  took  all  they  brought,  enter  the  waiting  bus.  Their  unhappy  driver  drove  off  as  he  is  instructed  to  go  immediately.  “If  you  are  hungry  Paul  Collins,  chief  cook  is  coming  soonest.  She  must  follow  five  other  women.”  “To  do  what?”  “serve  you  and  others  of  course.”  “Sir.  This  jersey  I  love  it.”     
 “It  is  now  your  own,  also  the  boot.”  “I  own  this?”  “is  it  too  big?”  “too  gorgeous.”  Tint  brown  coloured  jersey  Mr  Adewale  gave  me  shows  his  love  for  me  to  be  a  future  player.  “This  gold  trophy  will  last  for  two  years  under  our  care.  You  made  me  proud.  Our  national  dailies  first  headline  must  be  about  our  college  victory.  Mr  Stingy  should  have  heard  about  our  victory.     Our  college  is  best  in  Africa.”  “Paul  Collins  your  cloth.”  “Sandra  throw  it  to  me.”  “Paul  Collins   tell  me  the  truth.  You  were  a  striker  before?”  “never.”  “Then,  where  did  that  skills  of  yours  came  from?”  “God  surprised  me  when  I  need  him.  Watching  my  beloved  college  going  down  is  what  I  will  never  accept.”  “Hmm!”  “I  am  dedicating  my  emblem  to  my  late  mother.”  “How  did  it  happened?”  “I  got  to  this  city  by  chance.  I  search  for  job  desperately  that  was  why  I  am  sent  to  this  city.”  “Why  must  you  search  for  job  when  you  are  still  young?”  “mother  was  sick  so  I  need  money  to  keep  her  alive.”  “I  still  don’t  understand.  Where  is  your  father?”  “mother  told  me  he  had  travelled  to  Somalia.”  “He  should  not  have  when  he  had  family  behind.”  “I  would  say  I  am  desperate  to  meet  him  anywhere  in  this  world.”  “Somalia  is  distance  going  to.”  “Ship  can  go  there?”  “that  region  is  cold.  People  going  there  die  on  their  way.”  “Help  me  out  sir.  How  is  this  journey  going  to  be  if  I  embark  it?”  “sorrows,  sorrows  and  sorrows  if  you  refuse  me.”  “I  must  be  patient  sir.”  “What  type  of  job  did  you  finally  got?”  “housekeeping  job!”  “Wonders.  Continue  Paul  Collins.”  “This  is  where  result  of  my  hard  work  brought  me.”  “I  still  don’t  understand.  Who  brought  you  to  this  college?”  “Mr  Collins  my  boss.”  “That  your  boss  is  a  good  person.  He  cherished  you.”  “Education  is  best  legacy  for  him,  working  as  housekeeper  can’t  make  me  educated,  Mr  Collins  knew  that.”  “Can  I  meet  him?”  “he  is  in  Congo.”  “Is  he  a  Congolese?”  “No.  A  business  man  going  for  regional  meeting  annually  in  Congo.”  “Chief  cook  is  here.  We  have  waited  so  long  Mrs  Fabian.”  “Mr  Adewale  sorry  for  the  delay.”  “Paul  Collins  is  now  an  hero.”  “Paul  Collins  hug  me.  I  hate  defeat.  That  college  deserved  whatever  happen  to  them.”  “They  were  more  prepared  than  our  team.  Luck  is  just  against  them.”  “Serve  him  food  before  it  get  cold  Sade,”  Mrs  Fabian  commanded  one  of  her  co-worker.  Spices  on  food  served  discourage  me  from  eating  because  I  dislike  spices.  “It  seems  you  are  not  hungry  Paul  Collins?”                                    “too  much  spices  is  on  this  food.”  “Chief  cook  why  did  much  spices  appeared  on  this  food?”        “students  coming  to  eat  at  the  buffet  enjoy  spices  in  their  snacks.  Mr  Stingy  told  my  boss  that  we  should  not  be  serving  snacks  alone  but  also  to  cook  rice  and  any  meal,  that  prompt  me  to add  more  spices  on  food  students  demand.”  “Buffet  is  where  snacks  are  served.  Now  explain  where  this  rice  came  from?”  “restaurant  inside  the  buffet.”  “Is  Mr  Stingy  aware  of  it?”  “Mr  Thomas  knew  about  it.”  “What  was  his  reaction?”  “well  he  did  not  say  anything  about  that.”                                     “Sir.  Don’t  forward  this  issue.”  “Paul  Collins  there  is  no  problem.  It  came  as  a  surprise  to  see  rice  served  instead  of  snacks  and  soft  drinks.”  “I  may  not  play  ball  for  the  primary  again.  How  I   wish  such  competitions  are  organised  for  secondary  students.”  “We  must  see  the  organisers  privately  when  they  come  for  their  trophy.”  “Sir.  This  is  my  school  mother.”  “You  should  have  told  me  when  I  am  confronting  her.”  “I  suppose  but  I  want  you  to  finish  talking  with  her.”                 “Mrs  Fabian  sorry  for  hurting  you.”  “No.  No.  As  assistant  acting  headmaster  has  right  his  boss  has.”  I  stared  eating  when  I  have  my  appetite.  Soonest  all  food  in  my  plate  finished.  “Delicious  meal.  Can  I  get  some  more?”  “Sade,  is  there  more  rice?”  “I  cooked  food  that  is  enough  for  two  hundred  students.”  “Paul  Collins  my  son,  Sade  would  serve  you.  Meet  her.”  “I  trust  you  mom.”           “Mr  Stingy  is  around.”  “Gold  trophy  in  my  tenure,  forever  I  won’t  forget  this  victory. Paul  Collins  it  had  been  long  we  had  battled  so  tough  like  today.  We  almost  come  close  two  years  ago.”                                                                    “Life  is  not  friendly  with  me  two  years  ago.  Besides,  I  focused  more  on  this  small  stomach  of  mine  and  my  mother.”  “Poor  boy  mama’s  pet.  Prize  money  for  this  gold  trophy  is  doubled  two  years  ago.”  “Players  that  played  two  years  ago  where  they  sad  when  our  college  crashed  out?”  “I  whipped  them  on  assembly  ground.  I  got  a  call  before  last  two  years  final  was  played.  An  unknown  caller  told  me  our  college  players  had  danced  all  night  with  ladies  in  Addis  Ababa.”   “Maybe  the  opponents  framed  it.”  “I  called  a  friend  of  mine  which  I  saw  during  when  I  visited  them  on  pitch  on  semi-final  day.  He  confirmed  it  is  true  our  college  players  had  gone  to  night  club.”  “Did  college  coach  supported  them?”  “he  claimed  it  is  a  big  lie.”  “That  is  weird.” “I  tabled  the  issue  before  Mr  Thomas.”  “So?”  “that  unserious  coach  was  changed  then  Mr  Adewale  was  appointed  college  football  coach  with  immediate  effect.”  “That  place  you  mentioned  is  not  far  from  where  my  father  is.  I  could  had  done  the  worst.  I  may  had  search  about  for  my  father.”   “Is  his  address  with  you?”  “I  will  ask  even  a  tiny  creature  I  met  if  he  knew  Charles  a  good  man.”  “Fatal  mistake  it  could  had  been.”  “But  someone  may  had  seen  him  before.”  “Is  it  easy  to  leave  your  country,  go  far  east  Africa  asking  about  someone  you  can’t  even  describe?”  “Frustration  can  cause  that  sir.”  Large  crowd  stadium  I  played  became  silent  after  ninety  minutes  of  play.  No  tone  recorded  everywhere  calmed.  Decorations  had  been  blown  away  by  low  friendly  breeze.  Stadium  maintenance  had  given  authority  to  all  sweeping  groups  to  start  making  both  seats  neat  and  the  carpet  grass  should  be  rid  of  dirt.  I  joined  workers ,  working  tirelessly.  I  never  intend  collecting  anything  from  whoever  shall  be  paying  them.  Mr  Stingy  sat  on  stadium  carpet  grass  wishing  doing  same  but  he  was  not  allowed  based  on  his  personality.  Mrs  Fabian  had  packed  every  plates  used  for  eating.  She  had  left  with  her  co-workers.  Students  had  rushed  asking  for  me  from  securities  watching  over  the  stadium.  I  saw  Bravo  coming  forcefully,  I  dodged  him  if  not  he  could  had  asked  for  that  trophy  given  to  me.  I  mopped  seat  number  nine.  For  years  to  come  that  seat  shall  be  special  for  me  as  a  spectator.  Rain  had  soften  hard  part  difficult  cleaning  in  stadium.  Mr  Stingy  pinched  his  jaw  wondering  such  victory  in  a  large  stadium  he  was  standing  in.  Mammoth  crowd  had  waited  patiently  for  me  in  college.  Football  academy  certain  but  I  don’t  want  it  mentioned.  Stampede  almost  occurred  when  I  lifted  the  gold  trophy  for  viewing.  Jersey  I  worn  demanded,  I  was  almost  like  a  worldwide  football  star.  College  securities  denied  access  to  whoever   wants  to  touch  our  college  gold  trophy  that  is  newly  born.  “Paul  Collins  shift  back!”  Mr  Stingy  warned.  Most  muscular  students  overpowered  courageous  security  men.  Mr  Stingy  flicked  me,  I  backtrack  running  for  my  life  with  Mr  Stingy  doing  same.  Infighting  occurred  which  turns  bloody.  I  hid  in  college  toilet.  Mr  Stingy  was  also  at  my  back  panting  for  his  life.  “I  left  my  shoes  while  running  away.”  “Can  I  get  it  for  you  sir?”    “angry  students  are  unpredictable.  Some  may  be  dangerous  don’t  take  this  risk.”  “Sir.  Prowlers    stay  calm.”  Situations  protean  from  bad  to  worse.  College  windows  smashed  beyond  recognition. “Paul  Collins  I  can’t  harm  you.  I  want  to  speak  with  you.”  “Bravo  first  assure  me  everything  will  be  in  control!”  “trust  me  no  one  shall  hurt  you!”  “he  is  lying  Paul  Collins.”  Mr  Stingy  assured. “Here  I  am  Bravo.”  “Where  is  that  coward?”  “he  had  run  away.”  “Where  is  our  gold  trophy?”    “is  with  Mr  Stingy.”  “The  seniors  in  secondary  section  had  gone  for  one  week  break.  Anyone  you  ask  when  they  are  back  will  tell  you  I  am  good  in  boxing.  Mr  Stingy  snubbed  me  after  I  told  him  I  need  a  ring  in  this  place.”  I  flatter  Bravo  just  to  lessen  his  angry  mood.  “Bravo  I  shall  tell  him  myself,  boxing  ring  can  promote  talented  students.  I  know  you  wished  to  win  gold  trophy  for  our  college.”  “I  must  do  all  to  follow  you.”  “As  footballer?”  “As  happy  traveller.”                                                                                                        
“Mr  Adewale  must  be  aware  that  your  presence  in  safari  park  is  necessary.  When  he  comes  I  shall  convince  him  we  can  work  together  in  whatever  he  want  us  to  do.”  “This  is  a  very  good  assurance  coming  from  you.  I  believe  I  can’t  trust  anyone  but  you.”  “Dialogue  is  best  option  to  untold  disagreement.”  “Paul  Collins  you  reasoned  like  an  old  man.”  I  sympathised  with  him,  for  once  Bravo  was  not  a  troublesome  type.  All  his  fury,  anger  happened  because  his  request  was   rejected.  “Are  you  a  lover  of  peace?”  “I  want  it  always.  I  hate  chaos.”  “Bravo  can  you  assure  me  all  your  supporters  will  stop  their  violent  noises?”  “I  can  hundred  percent  assure  you  everything  would  be  calm.  All  those  supporters  of  mine  you  see  there,  enjoy  football  and  boxing.”  “I  don’t  need  you  to  tell  me  this.  I  know  that.”  “I  practiced  every  day,  doctors  at  home  once  prescribed  sleeping  pills  for  me  due  to  my  serious  insomnia  condition.”  “Rest  for  a  while,  your  health  should  come  first,  Mr  Stingy  will  look  into  this  issue.”  “You  think  so?”  “Yes.  Now  he  talks  to  me  as  if  I  am  his  lovely  son.”  “The  gold  trophy  our  College  won  makes  him  see  you  so  important.”  Worried  by  the  menacing  manner  of  approaching  students  I  hurriedly  call off discussions  with  Bravo.  “Wait,  I  have  negotiated  for  Paul  Collins  to  bring  coward  Mr  Stingy  out  from  his  hiding  place.”  Bravo  deceived  the  worried  students.  “I  have  a  word  for  them.”  I  lessen  deep  fear  I  had  living  inside  me.  “Hello  students  this  is  Paul  Collins.  Problems  we  have  I  can  reduce  it.  The  school  managements  will  solve  it.”  “Paul  Collins!  Paul  Collins!!”  they  toned.          “Mr  Stingy  promised  coming  out  only  when  situations  is  calmed.  Peace  first  then  negotiating  table  will  be  open.”  I  summarily  counted  number  of  them.  If  it  was  a  campaign  ground  I  have  won  their  mind.  Impatient  ran  over  them  as  my  words  were  long,  boring,  since  what  majority  of  them  wants  hearing  is  sports  facilities  must  be  created  urgently.  “Football!  Football!”  I  know  denying  them  what  they  wished  for  fresh  trouble  might  occur.  “Bravo  get  it  for  me!”  I  ordered.   Less  than  a  minute,  Bravo  appeared  with  the  lucky  football  that  brought  goal  for  our  college.  “Yes  O!  Yes  O!!”  agreed  celebration  declared.  “Paul  Collins  show  them  that  style  of  yours  Mangrove  college  can’t  ever  forget.”  Bravo  want  peace.  He  wanted  me  contributing  more.           To  him  skills  I  posses  can  melt  hostilities.  I  stare  at  them,  I  now  understand  how  eager  they  want  drama.  I  made  an  acrobatic  moves,  swing  the  ball  to  my  head.  For  hours  ball  rested  on  my  head  which  raises  concern  by  the  students  that  I  might  as  well  be  a  guru.  Such  drama  had  never  happened  in  our  college.  “Prodigy!  Prodigy!”  they  shouted.  Raining  me  with  lots  of  names  make  me  happy.  I  now  posed  warmly.  “Tomorrow  we  should  all  meet  at  college  field,  Mr Stingy  shall  make  a  very  important  announcement.”  I  convinced  them.  “Situations  as  this  is  brittle  when  room  for  dialogue  is  permitted.  Can  we  go  back  now?”  “Paul  Collins  leave  them,  each  of  them  will  go  back  happily.”  Choruses  arrested  any  hidden  agenda  from  the  students.  “Paul  Collins  is  our  man!”  Bravo  said  passionately.  “Thank  God  this  place  is  free.”  “Prolix  speech  almost  rend  this  situation  at  hand.”  “Paul  Collins,  I  want  problem  solver  to  be  attached  to  your  name.”  “That  is  enough  Bravo.  You  almost  make  the  situation  worst.”  “Don’t  think  so.  Mr  stingy  prevaricate  when  being  ask  about  the  way  forward.  This  is  lesson  he  had  learnt.”  “Bravo  you  can  go  now,  I  should  be  on  my  way  to  join  you  in  a  minute.”  Bravo  left,  I  went  straight  to  see  Mr  Stingy  in  where  he  was  hiding.  Fortunately,  he  was  in  good  state.  “have  they  all  gone?”     Mr  Stingy  asked.  “I  promised  them  an  address  will  be  made  on  our  college  field.”  “Have  you  gone  out  of  your  senses?  How  can  I  address  them  when  you  know  how  brutal  they  can  be.”  “Tell  them  the  truth  sir.”  “What  truth?”  “no  sporting  facilities  can  be  created  until  they  show  seriousness  on  sports.”  “That  reminds  me,  I  disapproved  any  sporting  facilities  since  last  year.” 
“Why  sir?”  “gold  trophy  slipped  away  when  we  suppose  winning  it  two  years  ago.”  “I  disagree  sir.  Disapproving  sporting  facilities  can  be  a  setback.  Change  your  mind  sir.”  “We  spent  large  sum  of  amount.  In  fact,  this  year  amount  spent  is  the  smallest.”  “Money  attached  to  the  gold  trophy  should  be  used  for  sporting  facilities,  sir.”  “What  type  of  facilities?”  “football   and  boxing  is  necessary  to  be  encourage.  Good  pitch,  boxing  ring,  is  their  demands.”  “I  shall  check  cost  before  embarking  on  such  projects.  Mr  Thomas  must  know  about  it.”  “This  money  with  you  can  do  all.  No  need  for  consultation.”  “Paul  Collins  $30000 money  prize  given  for  this  gold  trophy  is  for  me.  I  am  acting  headmaster.  Even  the  principal  heading  the  secondary  section  won’t  have  a  dime.”  “Sir.  This  is  not  encouraging.”  “Very  soon  the  helicopter  will  land.  At  least,  $15000 is  going  to  the  pilot.”  Mr  Stingy  confirmation  about  that  helicopter  I  was  waiting  for  increased  my  hope.  “Can  I  call  the  cops  to  dismiss  them?”  “to  call  cops  to  dismiss  your  students  is  wrong  when  their  rights  are  denied. ”  “Is  true.  Let  us  get  into  my  car,  I  shall  take  this  trophy  to  a  safe  place.”  I  ran  into  turmoil  of  thoughts  on  how  it  can  be  dangerous  if  my  fellow  students  see  me  in  their  enemy’s  car.  “Sir.  I  will  go  alone.  Bravo  is  waiting  for  me.”  “Respect  me,  do  as  I  say.”  We  ran  backward,  Mr  Stingy  opened  his  car  door,  we  both  entered.  “Don’t  be  offended  sir.  I  read  almost  all  the  students  minds.  To  see  me  in  your  car  means  you  have  bribed  me.”  “Just  an  assistance.”  Mr  Stingy  drove  roughly,  not  minding  whoever  is  passing.  “Too  dangerous  sir.”  “Paul  Collins  you  called  this  dangerous...?”  “An  animal  sir!”  “where?”  “You  just  hit  an  animal.” “That  is  even  the  smallest  I  hit  daily.”  “You  had  just  beat  a  traffic  regulation.”  “I  do  that  daily.”  “Wrong  sir.”  Speed  was  much,  I  noticed  tears  coming  out  from  my  eyes,  it  began  dropping  on  my  lap.  “I  have  gotten  there!”  “get  down,  Paul  Collins.  Be  ready  to  accompany  me  to  the  college  field  very  early.”  “I  shall  prepare  myself  sir.  Bye.”  I  was  too  weak  running.  I  forced  myself  to  walk  further.  After  three  minutes  walk,  I  got  to  my  college  hostel.  “Is  there  problem?”  Jonathan  who  had  been  watching  me  walking  weakly  asked.  “Mr  Stingy  drove  roughly  just  now.” “Did  he  threw  you  away  out  of  his  car?”  “he  almost  with  the  way  he  drove.”  “Paul  Collins  go  and  have  good  rest.  I  love  that  way  you  use  calming  the  angry  students.”  “It  is  mandatory  doing  that.  Meet  me  early  tomorrow  at  the  field.”  “I  will  do  that.”  I  entered  into  my  room  not long  after  talking  with  Jonathan.  I  slept  snoring.  As  usual  dozens  foods  were  kept  for  me  by  the  hostels  cook.  I  woke  up  late,  began  eating  wildly.  “I  would  solve  more  problem  if  given  that  chance.”  I  said  to  myself.  I  watch  birds  coalescing  beside  the  entrance  of  my  room.  “Why  can’t  they  sleep?”   I  recalled  when  I  play  with  pigeon,  feeding  them  whenever  they  come  playing  with  me.  Mother  take  it  as  surprise.  Manor  is  what  I  named  my  pigeon  my  mother  bought  for  me.    Harsh  cold  killed  Manor  after  staying  with  me  for  six  years.  As  unwelcome  birds  come  closer  the  hostel,  I  continue  to  remember  Manor.  “Oh  Manor  when  I  get  to  heaven  I  shall  see  you!”  as  if  the  birds  knew  I  was  talking  to  Manor  that  can’t  hear  me,  they  begin  to  use  their  beaks  to  knock  my  door.  I  flashed  the  torch,  they  refuse  flying  away.  I  now  know  they  want  comfort.                                           I  took  all  food  I  can’t  eat,  gave  them  one  by  one.  I  gave  each  enough  water.  Dew  on  grasses  signals  morning  is  by  the  corner.  I  started  sweeping,  singing  about  my  late  mother.  Henry  open  his  door,  shook  his  head,  close  back  the  door.  I  continue  to  sing  until  tears  dropped.  “Mother   I  won’t  forget  you!”  that  ended  the  lyrics.  I  kissed  amulet  Mr  Silas  gave  me.  Safari  park  is  all  I  think  about.  Mr  Adewale  must  be  expecting  full  preparations  from  me.  I  ironed  all  cloths  of  mine, arranged  them  neatly  in  my  travelling  bag  Mr  Collins  bought  for  me.  Students  had  started  their  morning  prayers.  Still  the  birds  won’t  go.  I  chase  them  as  they  battled  to  enter  my  room.     
As  morning  fully  appeared  they  flew  away.  “I  should  not  had  chase  them  in  first  place.”  I  shut  door  of  my  room,  engage  into  morning  prayer.  Henry  and  his  shy  brothers  were  busy  also  praying.  I  finish  as  planned.  I  went  knocking  all  room  door,  calling  every  students  out.  Every  seconds  produce  crowded  students  beyond  my  imagination.  “Paul  Collins  you  have  something  for  us?”  I  turn  about  trying  to  notice  where  that  question  came  from  I  could  not  find  the  student  that  asked  me.  “Good  morning  everyone,  sorry  for  the  inconveniences  I  may  had  caused,  Mr  Stingy  shall  make  an  announcement  about  sporting  facilities  that  will  be  created  soonest.”  “Another  lie  again.  We  have  heard  all  sort  of  lies,  if  this  comes  again  as  another  lie,  I  myself  will  set  this  college  ablaze.”  His  threat  brought  big  boost  among  the  students.  Not  too  long,  each  students  in  hostel  run  amok.  “Is  he  part  of  us?”  “he  was  voted  as  hostel  students  representative.”  “Sandra,  I  had  not  see  such  face  before.”  “That  is  Gomik.  He  has  so  much  supports.”  “Follow  me  Sandra.”  I  scrabbled  cheek  of  mine,  reasoned  deeper  how  I  can  avoid  another  clash  when  it  comes.  “Have  something  to  say?”  “Sandra  I  believe  Mr  Stingy  does  not  have  answers  to  questions  students  may  ask.  Sporting  facilities  is  a  big  project,  I  don’t  think  the  money  for  that  is  available.”  “Your  life  is  in  jeopardy.  Paul  Collins  expose  him  before  is  too  late.”  “Expose  Mr  Stingy?  If  it  happens,  I  am  expelled  already.”  “Stand  for  truth  and  nothing  more  than  that.”  “I  betrayed  students  that  placed  their  trust  on  me.”  “How  could  you  in  first  place  conspired  to  tell  lies.”  “I  never  did  as  you  think,  Sandra.”  “Paul  Collins  everywhere  your  name  is  been  mentioned  as  champion.  Most  students  talking  about  our  victory  against  Mangrove  college  never  stop  to  mention  dollars  attached  to  that  trophy.”  “Hold  it  there  Sandra.  That  is  your  plan  against  me?  To  rob  me?”  “Paul  Collins  why  you?  I  can’t  do  that  for  once!”  “$30000 I  received  for  our  team  is  not  with  me.  Mr  Stingy  collected  it,  promised  using  $15000 to  pay  the  pilot  coming  to  take  me  and  others  to  safari  park.  $15000 remaining  shall  go  for  sporting  facilities  projects.”  “Mr  Stingy  told  you  that?”  “yes  Sandra!”  “that  is  extortion.  Big  crime  I  may  say ...”  “I  have  no  choice  but  to  give  him  the  money.”  “Paul  Collins  tell  your  supporters  what  he  did.”  “This  is  not  an  issue  Sandra.”  “Other  players  that  took  part  in  that  game  thinks  money  they  expect  is  right  with  you.”  “Mr  Adewale  knew  what  happened.  He  will  explain  everything,  but  I  also  know  he  shall  warn  them  not  to  tell  anyone.”  “Money  for  sporting  projects  should  come  direct  from  Mr  Thomas.  Mr  Thomas  loved  football  than  any  other  sports.”  “Actually  Money  had  been  approved  for  sports.  Mr  Stingy  enforced  a  veto  against  the  approval.”  “That  man  I  pray  he  should  not  be  toppled  before  Mr  Thomas  is  back.”  “Any  plan  against  him  comes  directly  to  his  office.”  “Paul  Collins,  his  closeness  with  you  signifies  something  unexplainable.”  “Snitch?  I  will  reject  doing  that  a  million  times.  Mr  Stingy  won’t  hire  me  as  one  of  his  boys.”  “He  has  already,  his  conversations  with  you  tells  more.”  “Okay.  I  trust  myself.”  “I  have  a  sweet  chocolate  inside  my  pocket.  Do  you  wish  eating?”  “bring  it.”  “It  had  been  with  me  for  almost  one  month.  Our  neighbour  back  home  gave  it  to  me  on  the  day  of  my  departure.”  “Chocolate  as  gift?”  “Yes.  Box  of  chocolates.  I  eat  it  regularly.  It  makes  me  to  forget  people  I  missed  back  home.”  “Even  your  parents?”  “that  is  only  people  I  can’t  forget  when  eating  it.”  “Really?  so  if  it  happens  Mr  Adewale  list  you  among  other  students  going,  box  of  chocolates  will  also  go  with  you?”  “it  will.”  “Chocolate  girl,  your  wish  is  to  follow  me.”  “I  won’t  change  it  for  once.”  “Bravo  also  hope  to  be  with  me  there.”  “Bravo?  He  will  cause  problems  for  everyone.  Mr  Adewale knows  that.”  “Sandra  guess,  who  else  will  go  with  me?”  “I,  number  two,  then  others.”  “Others  like  who?”  “maybe  Jonathan,  maybe  Michael.  I  dreamt  about  it.”  “I  shall  wait  till  that  day.”       
A  ghastly  smile  Sandra  present  shows  her  dream  might  come  to  pass.  “Big  challenge  is  easy  solving  if  only  all  wiles  in  your  brain  can  be  tactically  used.  The  special  ball  is  last  minute  tactic  I  used  to  deceive  all  students  protesting  to  have  sporting  facilities.  As  situation  tensed  Mr  Stingy  already  preparing  to  vanish.”  “Putting  your  precious  life  at  risk.  Mr  Stingy  did  not  even  care  about  you.”  “When  boss  return  I  must  brief  him  of  situations  here.”  “Paul  Collins  wait  till  you  return  from  safari  park  before  thinking  of  telling  your  boss.”  “Why  Sandra?”  “he  won’t  delay  changing  you  to  another  college  more  safer.”  “I  must  keep  this  as  a  secret  when  he  returns.”  “Here  since?  We  can  go  to  field  now.”  “Sandra  let  us  wait  a  while  in  my  room.  I  can’t  go  to  class  when  back  from  field.”  “Class?  I  too.”  Sandra  followed  me  as  I  demanded.  We  both  start  reading  in  my  room.  “Bell  must  be  jingled  before  all  students  assembled  on  college  field.”              “This  book  is  interesting  Paul  Collins.”  “It  talks  about  animals,  their  characters   and  relationship  they  have  with  humans.”  “I  can’t  wait  to  take  this  book  along  with  me!”  “to  where?”  “of  course  safari  park.”  “Chocolate  girl,  you  are  not  even  assured  to  go  along  with me.”  “Stop  that  Paul  Collins.”  “Most  animals  I  will  see  is  listed  on  the  book.”  “I  expect  you  to  say  most  animals  we  shall  both  see  in  safari  park  is  in  this  book.”  “Sorry  if  I  wrong  you.”  “Paul  Collins ... no!”  “Sandra  our  food  is  coming  soonest.”  “Yes.  That  is  all  I  want.  Including  both  of  us  as  one.”  As  I  sank  deeper  reading  curiously,  a  knock  on  my  door  allowed  me  opening  the  door  halfway.  “Oh,  I  am  Sorry.  I  had  forgot  it  is  you.”  I  collected  usual  food  I  was  entitled  to.  “Sandra  it  has  come.    Take  this  spoon,  eat  as  much  as  you  can.”  “I  eat  not  long  ago.”  “Eat  what?”  “chocolates,  grape,   and  I  drain  chilled  water.”  “Chocolate  girl,  that  can’t  satisfy  your  stomach.”  “I  will  eat  little.”  Sandra  swallowed  full  spoon  of  hot  rice.  “Hmm.. sweet  food?”  “That  means  for  long  you  had  not  taste  the  hostel  cooks  food?”  “confession  time!”  “what  confession?”  “most  ladies  cooking  for  our  hostel  never  stop  setting  their  eyes  on  you.  I  decided  within  me,  I  will  not  eat  their  food.”  “So ... you  had  been  monitoring  them?  Sandra  do  you  concur  this  is  jealousy?”  “I  don’t  trust  all  of  them,  that  is  all!”  “end  this  rubbish  from  now!”  “then,  warn  them  to  keep  their  eyes  away,  from  you.”  “I  hate  to  jeopardize  citizens  human  rights!”  “human  rights?  Lust,  best  way  to  say  this.”  “Sandra  continue  eating.”  “Appetite  limited.”  “Is  it  because  of  what  I  said?”  “don’t  go  far  Paul  Collins.”  “Chocolate  girl,  bring  it  I  must  finish  it.”  I  had  read  her  mind,  she  take  offence  when  told  the  truth.  I  could  not  persuade  her  to  smile,  she  can  be  provoked.  “Paul  Collins  I  must  change.  I  easily  get  angry.  I  am  temperamental!”  “Sandra  animals  had  languages  unknown  to  man.  That  book  on  your  hand  tells  more  of  that.  Animals  in  safari  park  understands  nothing  more  than  their  own  language.”  “I  shall  speak  their  languages  to  them.  Tamed  animals  shall  comprehend  my  communications.”  “Your  communications  should  be  simple  to  them.  Some  of  them  are  inquisitive.”  “Which  one  exactly?”  “the  cheetah.  Fastest  land  animal  of  the  cat  family.”  “It  can  chase  us,  if  it  does  not  understand  us.”  “There  is  fully  alert  guards  holding  rifles  full  of  bullets.  Wild  animals  can’t  be  seen,  if  at  all  tamed  animals  turn  against  everyone  they  see,  just  run  for  your  life.”  “Before  running,  I  must  cling  your  left  hand.”  “Why  not  right  hand?”  “difficult  running  holding  someone’s  right  hand.”  “How  did  you  arrived  at  that?”  “My  brother  told  me.   He  is  an  athlete.  A  dedicated  sports  man.”  “Is  he  your  younger  brother?”  “I  just  know  that  we  are  twins.”  “For  that  fact,  your  brother  suppose  to  be  here.”  “He  is  schooling  abroad  on  scholarship.  A  bookworm  unlike  me.”  “What  scholarship  is  he  on?”  “Athletic  scholarship.  His  former  school  back  home  sponsored  him  to  learn  more  outside  his  country.”  “One  on  one,  I  shall  discuss  this  with  Mr  Thomas.  Good  athlete  is  also  in  this  college.  They  jogged  daily.”         “On  field  daily,  they  practice  during  evening.”  “So  you  also  had  been, seeing  them?”  “Paul  Collins  if  I  don’t,  then  who  will ...?”  “Sandra  you  are  not  even  serious  about  practicing  with  Sammy  and  the  others.  Maybe  when  you  have  left,  Sammy  may  be  looking  for  you.”  Her  face  redden  as  she had  one  choice,  either  to  practice  basketball  with  other  students  and  forget  safari  park  or  go  to  safari  park  and  forget  to  train  basketball.  “I  had  decided  to  suspend  any  plan  of  going  to  train  basketball  with  others.  Safari  park  is  what  I  will  never  stop  dreaming  of,  the  ambience,  colourful  birds,  rare  plants,  monkeys  hopping  on  trees.  Mr  Adewale  is  my  last  hope  to  make  that  dream  of  mine  a  reality.”  “Sandra,  take  a  look  at  this  knapsack.  It  is  used  for  short  journey.”  “Where  do  you  get  it  from?”  “In  my  travelling  box,  I  saw  it.”  “I  need  one  if  you  can  help  me.”  “I  only  had  one.  I  don’t  know  where  to  help  you  get  one.”  “I  salute  you  Paul  Collins.”  “For  what?”  “all  you  need  for  that  journey  is  already  positioned.”  “I  prepared  in  case  emergency  comes.  Yes,  this  torch,  is  necessary.  Matchstick  is  useful  when  battery  for  this  torch  fails.”  “Paul  Collins,  hang  your  knapsack  to  the  field.”  “I  can  see  you  reasoned  like  me.  Today  might  be  that  day  I  had  been  waiting  for.  Mr  Adewale  promised  me  the  helicopter  shall  come  soonest.”  “Can  I  also  go  and  arrange  travelling  bags  of  mine?”  “go  in  time  Sandra,  bell  will  be  jingled  soonest.”  Sandra  left,  came  back  exactly  twenty  minutes.  “I  am  ready  as  well.”  9: 00  on the dot.  College  bell  jingled.  All  students  ran  out  of  their  rooms,  preparing  for  another  showdown  at  the  field  in  case  they  hear  another  lies.  Each  rooms  were  shut  to  prevent  an  intruder.  Sandra  and  I  walked  alone  thirty  minutes  after  college  bell  jingled.  From  afar,  crops  of  students  making  hullabaloos.  “Paul  Collins  I  hope  you  have  what  to  say?”  “Trust  me  Sandra!”  on  noticing  me,  the  students  start  shouting  my  name.  I  could  not  believe  it  is  me;  a  president  of  a  country  was  never  given  such   an  ovation.  I  spotted  Mr  Stingy’s  car  coming,  I  was  now  happy  he  never  disappointed.  “Mr  Stingy  is  calling  you!”  Sandra  been  a  smart  girl  noticed  Mr  Stingy  trying  to  signal  me  to  come  and  meet  him.  I  went  responding  to  him.  “Is  situations  under  control?”  He  asked.  “Yes  sir.  I  am  happy  because  today  shall  be  a  special  day  to  remember,  sir!”  “what  can  be  special  about  today?  Do  you  know  how  I  feel  hotness  within  me?”  that  word  alone,  hammered  me.  Mr  Stingy  is  someone  not  to  trust.  He  had  no  offer  that  one  can  rely  on.  “Paul  Collins  where  are  you?”  worried  students  shouted.  I  could  hear  some  students  talking  in  bad-tempered  tone.  Knapsack  hung  on  my  shoulder  about  falling,  I  pulled  it  up.  Students  watching  me  thought  I  want  to  train  them  football.  Some  knew  what  brought  me  and  them.  I  was  about  talking  to  Sandra   when  Mr  Stingy  started  his  speech  unexpectedly.  “Hello  students  of  Wisdom  college,  I  shall  be  snappy  in  what  I  want  to  say.  Paul  Collins  open  my  car  boot,  something  is  inside.  Bring  it  for  me.”  I  went  as  I  was  instructed.  I  ransacked  inside  the  boot.  I  remove  boxing  gloves,  footballs,  goal  post  nets.  Accolades  from  students  increases  as  I  brought  what  is  necessary.  “What  is  this  signifying? It  is  all  about  sports.  Facilities  shall  be  put  in  place.”  “Mr  Adewale  coming  here  with  boxes  of  cloths?”  Sandra  alert.  A  stormy  noise  of  an  helicopter  was  approaching  us  from  above  distance. “Helicopter!  Helicopter!!”  students  shouting  as  if  something  bad  is  about  happening.  Whirl  noises  everywhere.  Mr  Adewale  spoke  silently  to  Mr  Stingy,  both  shook  their  heads.  Mr  Stingy  called  me,  Sandra,  Jonathan  and  Michael.  He  told  every  students,  four  of  us  did  well  in  Mr  Adewale’s  test.  Sandra  screamed  out  joy,  her  dream  came  to  pass.  “Paul  Collins!”  Mr  Adewale  called  me.                                    I  was  ordered  to  carry  all  boxes.  I  took  every  boxes  inside  the  waiting  helicopter.  “Mr  Johnbull  suppose  to  follow  five  of  us  along,  he  is  not  coming  for  now.  I  am  head,  do  as  I  say.”  We  were  in,  the  pilot  take  off,  students   waved  emotionally.  “4500 km  to  safari  park,”  the  pilot  said.    
                                                                                 CHAPTER  SIX                                                                    
“Kenya  is  a  lovely  place  to  be.  Students,  right  choice  to  make!”  “Kenya!”  it appeared  as  big  surprise  when  our  pilot  mentioned  our  unknown  exact  destination.  “Mr  Adewale,  your  students  seems  surprised.”  “I  was  warned  not  to  reveal  where  we  are  heading  to.  Paul  Collins  this  is  a  precious  gift  I  have  for  you.  I  promised  giving  you  when  I  am  back  from  symposium.”  “Precious  book.”  “So... your  $15000 is  beside  your  seat  corner,  Mr  Pilot.”  “Orube!”  “Oh,  accept  my  apology  Orube.”  “I  can  see  we  both  negotiated  well  Mr  Adewale.”  “Sandra  hold  my  knapsack.”  I  alerted  her.  “Okay  Paul  Collins.”  “I  taught  first  time  when  I  came  to  your  class  Paul  Collins.”  “I  was  told  you  were  appointed  college  coach.” “Yes.  I  specialised  in  teaming  up  with  the  management  for  students  to  write  a  short  test  so  as  to  travel  to  place  they  may  not  have  heard  or seen  before.”    “Sir,  Is  this  first  time  students  of  our  college  will  travel  to  Kenya?”  “you  have  said  it.  First  in  history.  You  all  are  fortunate.  I  will  say  gold  trophy  you  won  assured  our  journey.”  “Like  how?”     “The  $30000 prize  reward  helped  us  to  raise  $15000  for  this  journey.”  “That  means  there  was  no  money  travelling  to  Kenya  until  our  college  sprang  surprise?”  “Kenya  was  not  our  destination.  We  were  heading  to  the  northern  part  of  our  country  before.”  “Paul  Collins  thank  you  very ...  much!”  my  classmates  present.  “Bravo  must  unleashed  vengeance,  to  him,  he  believes  he  is  wrongfully  dropped  just  for  his  role  in  the  violent  protests.”  “I  did  that.  Bravo  name  is  swapped  for  Michael.”  “I  am  fortunate!”  Michael  vibrates.  “Son  of  a  pauper  parents  would  never  imagine  himself  in  an  helicopter,”  I  voiced  out.  Journey  air  is  sweet,  kiting  birds  playing  with  one  another.  I  checked  images  through  narrow  porthole;  I  became  puzzled  seeing  creatures  of  earth  turning  to  midget.  Mr  Adewale  brought  a  folded  map  from  his  pocket,  spread  it  widely  and  show  us  countries  of  each  continent.  “This  is  Kenya  on  east  African  region.”  “Which  class  are  they?”  our  pilot  asked  Mr  Adewale.  “Primary  four.”  “I  have  a  son  also  in  primary  school,  but  he  is  in  primary  three.”  We  enjoyed  cool  weather  on  the  way.  “Retirement  soonest!”  “I  share  your  gladness,”  Mr  Adewale  said  eagerly.  The  pilot  tap  control  buttons  facing  him  and  speed  from  our  helicopter  increases.  “Good  engine.  It  can  never  fail  me.”  This  time  again,  a  gear  was  shift  up;  our  helicopter  blades  swung  more  louder.  Strong  breeze  pulled  Sandra  off  her  seat.  She  screamed  to  survive  her  gory  encounter.  When  look  from  far,  one  might  conclude  she  is  of  a  Rastafarian  family.  “Fasten  your  belt!”  our  pilot  ordered.  “Two  decades  of  piloting  is  not  a  day  job.  I  shall  not  lose  anyone  of  you.”  Mr  Adewale  took  all  blames  as  his  while  he  held  Sandra  tight.  “Your  saving  grace  is  your  belt  you  mistakenly  ignored.”  Jonathan  woke  up  after  having  a  little  sleep.  “I  hope  no  problem?”  “everything  is  in  control,”  our  pilot  gave  out.  “Brave  Maasai  cherished  their  cattle.  Don’t  for  once  kill  any  of  their  cattle.”  “As  I  am  with  them  they  won’t.”    Mr  Adewale  reminiscent  us  of  our  reason  for  coming  so  far.  “Map  reading  can  save  anyone  in  case  something  wrong  is  about  happening  in  a  strange  land.  Approach  it  with  calm  and  it  will  give  all  you  need.”  “Can  I  land  on  rock  when  we  get  to  Kenya?”  “O,  no  change  that  plan  sir.”    I  remark.  “When  viewing  animals  stand  on  rock  to  keep  off  from  danger.  I  tell  you  this  because  as  a  pilot  I  have  seen  a  lot.”  I  rest  head  of  mine  on  back  seat  where  our  pilot  sat.  I  think  of  Bravo  how  decisive  he  might  be  as  class  monitor.  Boss  also  in  my  mind;  when  back  from  Congo  he  won’t  hesitate  seeing  me.  “Paul  Collins  sit  up.”  “Sandra  I  want  to  eat  some  chocolates,  do  you  have  any?”  “I  have  one,  take  it.”  I  remove  the  wrap,  eat  anxiously.  I  wondered  if  our  helicopter  can deliver;  14hours  had  gone  still  there  is  no  hope  we  can  get  to  Kenya  before  dark.  While  on  air,  evening  turned  into  night.  “Bring  out  your  torch  if  you  have  Paul  Collins.  I  can’t  find  mine,  I  may  have  forgot  it.”  I  flashed  to  direction  of  each  portholes.  I  quietly  licked  lips  of  mine  due  to  fear.  “Map  with  me  is  not  useful  for  now.  When  everywhere  is  bright  I  would  not  hesitate  using  it.”  Mr  Adewale  declared.  “Students,  they  could  prove  to  be  too  tired  when  travelling  far.  As  pilot  I  must  stay  awake  in  case  of  danger.”  No  image  shows  to  guide  us  to  the  exact  location  to  land.  “Landing  in  a  dangerous  zone  can  be  dangerous,  sir  be  careful!”  “This  money  is  for  going  and  coming.  I  must  get  back  to  lift  all  of  you,  be  fully  ready,  any  place  I  land  should  be  that  place  I  want  you  all  to  wait  for  me  when  I  am  back.”  “We  shall  wait  till  your  arrival.  I  told  the  headmaster  in  a  week  time,  we  must  have  land  back.”  “I  hope  there  is  enough  money  for  all  upkeep?”  “more  than  enough  is  with  me.”  “Good  luck  to  you  all.”  I  sang  just  to  make  our  state  lively,  sleep  slow  my  music  to  its  barest  minimum.  Sandra  continue  as  she  noticed  I  am  becoming  too  weak  to  push  on.  I  resisted  sleeping,  now  focusing  on  button  directing  our  helicopter.  All  I  needed  is  becoming  familiar  with  each  button  so  as  preventing  calamity  when  something  goes  wrong.  “Almost  close!”  the  stressed  helicopter  touched  down  lately.  Looking  through  the  porthole,  I  almost  fainted,  gloomy  atmosphere  contributed  to  my  fear.  Noisy  blade  still  swinging  harder.  “Get  down  gradually,”  the  pilot  instructed.  “Be  all  careful  since  there  is  no  one  to  speak  to.  But  I  suggest  there  may  be  somewhere  safe  to  rest  until  the  morning  appears.”  “No  problem  in  that.  I  shall  handle  every  situations.  You  can  now  go.”  The  helicopter  stopped,  started  again,  lift  up  and  continue  its  journey  as  programmed.  “Globetrotter  hard  to  find.  Paul  Collins  focus  your  torch  on  our  route.  Snakes  can  be  hiding  closer  here.  Do  you  hear  that?  Something  hissed.”  Unseen  crickets  chirps  around  us.  “Most  animals  in  safari  park  are  sleeping  by  now.  I  don’t  know  exact  location  of  the  safari  park,  trust  friendly  Kenyans,  they  must  show  us  that  place.”  “I  am  tired,  I  need  rest,”  Sandra  pleaded.  “Hold  your  hands  like  a  team!”  Mr  Adewale  never  showed  tiredness  throughout  our  journey.  “Once  spotting  any  good  place  fit  to  rest  don’t  waste  time  alerting  me,  Paul  Collins.”  “I  will  sir.”  “Yes,  this  should  be  okay  for  now!”  a  grassy  area  free  from  poisonous  reptiles  was  our  right  place  for  the  night.  Tall  grasses  tempted  Mr  Adewale,  he  hesitated  not  in  cutting  the  grasses  within  his  reach.  He  put  it  into  his  small  bag.  “Your  knapsack  can’t  take  all  this,  Paul  Collins.”  As  we  rested,  I  brought  out  all  the  grasses,  twisted  it  and  form  a  local  roof  to  guard  our  heads.  Thick  part  of  it  is  used  as  pillow.  “Good  boy,  I  cherished  your  creativity.”  We  laid  closer,  distancing  ourselves  is  last  thing  in  our  minds.  Troublesome  mosquitoes  flushed  themselves  to  disturb  each  of  us.  I  refused  sleeping.  Noise  of  mosquitoes  around  Mr  Adewale  led  him  slapping  himself.  “I  dislike  this  noise.   Emm... is  anyone  of  you  hungry?”  “no!”  we  expressed.  “I  have  pack  of  biscuits  in  my  box.  Paul  Collins  where  is  my  boxes?”  “beside  me  sir.”  “Oh!  So  close,  pardon  me  is  stress.”  Sandra  pushed  herself  up,  use  her  warm  jacket  to  cover  herself  fully  as  cold  in  Kenya  shifted  to  our  place.  I  crawled  facing  Sandra.  She  was  backing  me,  I  pinched  her,  she  screamed.  Sandra  taught  it  is  snake  that  bite  her.  Mr  Adewale  watching  me  while  drinking  a  bottle  of  water.  “Paul  Collins  why  now?”  “I  want  her  to  be  ready  for  the  worst.”  Sandra  got  annoyed  with  me,  pushed  me  away.  “I  want  you  to  apologise  for  your  wrongdoing.”  I  apologised  not  long,  things  became  normal  again.  I  faced  the  moon,  stars,  watched  how  they  moved  simultaneously.  “Our  college  is  not  cool  as  this  place.”  Mr  Adewale  strike  the  matchstick  to  its  matchbox,  flames  burnt  remnant  of  idle  grasses  on  ground  beside  me.  I  shifted  to  feel  that  warmth  heat  I  refuse  missing.  “Sleep  all  of  you.  Snakes  hate  coming  closer  to  flames.  I  promise  you  nothing  can  come  and  attack.”    
 Hooting  push  louder  at  deep  end.  I  panic  for  our  lives,  I  recalled  I  had  heard  brave  Maasai  tribesmen  join  hands  to  save  travellers  attacked  by  lions.  “Paul  Collins  try  sing  for  us  to  sleep.”   Pressure  seems  to  be  growing  on  me  to  act  when  my  service  is  needed.  “I  have  a  song.”  “Title  first!”  “Do  you  all  wish  knowing  the  title?”  empty  response  from  my  classmates  led  me  to  delay  singing.  I  adjusted  myself,  stand  erect  in  an  open  posture,  my  head  held  high,  my  chest  raised,  forehead,  lips,  and  mouth  relaxed.  After  a  brief  fictitious  name  of  mine;  I  lunched  into  a  much  anticipated  tone.  “This  music  I  had  intend  singing  is  titled—SWEET  MOTHER!”  “start,  I  am  losing  patient.”  My  saliva  running  dry  as  I  sang  minute  by  minute.  How  could  I  say  of  my  classmates,  my  teacher  who  were  weeping  profusely  as  they  imagined  such  music  still  exist.  “I  can’t  cope. This  music  is  reducing  my  happiness,”  Sandra  warned.  Sandra  fold  her  hands  backward,  walked  down  distance,  my  music  refreshed  her  memory  back  to  what  is  only  known  to  her.  Quickly,  Mr  Adewale  pulled  out  his  sharp-edged  knife,  to  him,  he  noticed  an  hidden  person  calling  Sandra.       I  stopped  singing,  shout  back  Sandra  to  come.  Echoes  still  wallowed  in  deep  end.  We  ran  hastily  grabbing  Sandra  down  as  she  force  for  freedom.  She  overpowered  us,  stood  up,  flung  her  hands  crying  as  she  confessed  my  music  allowed  her  remembering  her  mother.  “Sandra  we  are  going  to  stay  not  long,  your  mother  shall  see  you,  don’t  panic.”  Mr  Adewale  said.  Getting  back,  I  sat,  refusing  a  dime  of  sleep.  Rattling  noises  around  each  corners  is  a  preparation  for  any  attack.  Mr  Adewale  opened  one  of  his  boxes,  brought  out  a  light  blanket,  covered  our  bodies.  I  stretched comfortably.  “Breath  silently!”  Mr  Adewale  advised.  “Safari  park  is  closer.  Friendly  Maasai  grazing  their  cattle  must  lead  me  there.”  “Sir;  can  we  trust  them?”  “why  not!”  at  expected,  we  all  slept closer.  Our  sleep  was  sliced  down  by  croaking  from  the  frogs.  “Water  front  us?  Morning  so ...  fast?  Damn!”  “be  all  ready.  Look  over  there!”  gigantic  colourful  peacock  dancing  near  a  grassy  field.  “It  is  welcoming  us  to  Kenya!”  I  announced.  “Bamboo  is  necessary,  we  shall  walk  around  to  cut  as  many.  Local  thatched  house  is  good  to  live  in.”  It  came  like  an  hunting  game  as  I  ransacked  all  tall  grasses  distracting  me  from  noticing  a  bamboo  tree.  “Here!  Here!”  I  traced  the  tree  to  its  roots.  “Start  cutting  it!”  I  climbed,  cling  to  the  bamboo  tree  and  pushed  four  trunks  down.  Work  was  in  progress,  I  walked  barefoot,  carried  heavy  bamboo  on  head  of  mine.  I  pant  heavily,  as  I  took  each  log  of  bamboos  to  site  of  use.  Others  hit  down  their  bamboos  not  long  I  arrived.  Quadruple  quagmire  swallowed  heap  sands  we  poured  on  the  specified  site  good  to  live.                                                             Sandra  looked  at  me  glassily,  I  understand  she  needs  water,  rill  distance  from  our  home  had  enough  water  for  drinking;  I  fetched  water  with  a  plastic  bowl,  carried  it  home  so  that  our  strength  can  increase.  I  slopped  my  water  on  our  temporal  house.  Drained  from  the  plastic  bowl.  “What  do  we  eat  now?  Paul  Collins  have  an  idea?”  “bush  animal!”  “Yeah  good  idea.      Get  set,  hunting  hour!”  I  and  Mr  Adewale  hold  a  sharp  mouthed  filmy  bamboo  as  a  spear  for  hunting.  Home  is  far  reaching  as  we  walked  distance.  “Nairobi  had  impressive  lands,  this  is  one  of  it.  Over  there  is  two  significant  African  landmarks.  To  the  north  lies  Mount  Kenya,  at  5,199  meters  the  nation  highest  mountain  and  second  highest  in  Africa.  Slight  chance  can  allow  us  to  south.”  “To  see  what?”  I  asked.  “Mount  Kilimanjaro,  highest  mountain  in  Africa,  of  a  5,895  meters.  Snow  ice  on  it.”  “Sir,  the  Maasai  can  take  us  there.”  “Not  here  for  that.  Hunting  game  brought  you  and  I  here.”  An  hungry  squirrel  hopped  from  a  baobab  tree.  Mr  Adewale  caught  it  by  the  tail.  Thirty-minutes  walking  home  easy  since  none  of  us  spoke  while  walking.  “Dry  wood,  Jonathan  set  it,”  Mr  Adewale  instructed.  I  pull  of  the  skin  of  the  timid  squirrel,  roasted  it  alive.  Scent  of  burnt  meats  raise  our  appetite.  We  ate  hungrily  leaving  behind  no  traces  of  bones.*                                              
“Peg  is  going  to  be  useful.  I  must  get  one.”  Mr  Adewale  smooth  a  fat  bamboo  trunk  to  a  size.   “Now  hang  your  cloths  on  it!”  the  peg  went  deep  into  the  sand;  only  top  of  it  faced  up.  “Brush  your  teeth  one  after  the  other.  Wash  yourself  with  that  water  in  that  bowl,  please  look  good;  today  is  that  day  we  had  been  waiting  for.  Safari  park  is  not  far.”  I  was  excited,  what  I  wait  hearing  is  enough  to  believe  I  did  not  come  far  to  a  wrong  place.  I  droop  all  cloths  on  the  standing  peg.  “Ready  sir.”  “So  quick  all  of  you?  Are  you  sure  you  all  wash  yourselves?”  “Yes!”  we  yelled.  “That  direction  is  a  fast  route.  Hold  this  map  Sandra!”  Mr  Adewale  focused  on  a  district  that  will  easy  our  journey.  “Move!”  marching  to  safari  park  is  strenuous,  four  hours  of  walk  weakened  me.  “River!”  sprawling  slums  beside  the  river  make  it  hard  diving  to  swim.          “I  want  to  swim!”  “Paul  Collins  is  everything  okay  with  you?”  “yeah.”  “You  can  but  be  careful.”    I  dip  myself  into  the  nearby  slum.  Everyone  watch  as  they  see  how  prowess  I  had  with  slum. Cool  river  in  Nairobi  good  swimming.  “Paul  Collins  be  careful!”  Michael  warned.  “Something,  I  can  hear  violent  slashing!”  “come  out  Paul  Collins!  Come  out!”  “it  is  crocodile.  I  don’t  want  to  die,  help  me!”  “stay  where  you  are,  I  am  coming!”  Mr  Adewale  save  me  unhurt,  I  was  grateful  to  him  for  his  quick  response.  “Many  gigantic  crocodiles  inside  there.”  “Your  fault,  lucky  enough  crocodiles  didn’t  harm  you.”  “Hills!”  “Jonathan  that  is  exact  place  I  want  to  feel.”  Till  now  there  is  not  even  one  person  we  came  in  contact  with.  Cattles  feed  on  dry  grasses,  some  of  them  running  for  their  dear  life  as  they  noticed  our  appearance.  Climbing  the  hills  melt  my  mind.     Sandy  holes  breaking  crunchily.  “Careful  or  else  something  unpleasant  might  occur.”  “Yes.  Yes  master.”  Distant  animals  seen  easily  from  the  hills,  I  still  search  for  one  single  person. No  Maasai  guiding  their  cattle.  “Can  we  live  here?”  “Paul  Collins  if  yes,  wrong  decision  to  make.”  “This  is  my  second  house.  I  won’t  go  back  to  that  shanty  place.”  “Maasai  tribesmen  rest  on  hills,  if  they  spotted  us  they  might  think  we  are  poachers.”  “Paul  Collins  take,  study  this  map  very  well.  Quick!”  map  I  expect  is  different  from  the  one  I  saw.  “This  is  map  of  Kenya.  World  map  with  me  can’t  help.  It  is  useless  for  now!”  animals  running  away  never  knew  we  are  on  top  of  the  hills.  As  I  peek  towards  map  of  Kenya,  something  tells  me  we  are  far  from  where  we  prayed  to  see.  “Sir.  Long  way  going,  this  is  route  to  Kenya-Tanzania  border.  Kilimanjaro  is  not  too  far.”   “O,  the  pilot  land  on  wrong  place.  How  do  I  call  for  rescue?  He  won’t  even  come  now.”  “You  paid  him  sir.  He  has  all  right  to  come  and  complete  his  mission.”  “What  mission  again?” “taking  us  to  safari  park  with  no  stress.”  “Let  me  call  him!” Mr  Adewale  dialled  hurriedly  as  he  frowned.  “No  service.  I  need  to  get  down.”  “Keep  trying  sir.”  “Umm,  no  matter  how  I  persist  network  can’t  be  good  here.”  Mr  Adewale  about  getting  down,  noticed  a  man  carrying  firewood  on  his  head.  “First  person!”  I  start  imagining  how  possible  it  is  for  me  flying  down,  so  that,  that  man  can  show  us  route  to  safari  park.  Mr  Adewale  seems  predicting  what  I  intend  doing.  “It  will  be  a  fatal  blow  if  you  die  this  way!”  I  changed  my  mind.  “He  has  gone,  forget  about  him,  another  person  can  show  up.”  Mr  Adewale  encouraged.  “That  idiot  pilot,  he  must  apologise  when  he  come  back  for  us.  Safari  park  is  not  even  around  here.  Oh  my  God!”  “Paul  Collins  don’t  create  panic  around  your  classmates.”  “He  is  speaking  angrily  because  he  thinks  that  pilot  betrayed  not  only  himself  but  we  as  well.”  “That  is  enough.  Let  us  work  towards  success,  we  didn’t  come  far  to  trade  blames.”  Self  mistrust  rammed  into  everyone,  making   our  state  dolorous.  “Bravo  may  not  wished  me  well.  I  scored  same  mark  with  him;  I  was  selected  instead  of  him  on  favouritism.      I  won’t  smile  until  I  leave  here.”  “Is  this  a  blame?  I  brought  you  based  on  your  intelligent  way  of  doing  things;  besides,  you  have  one  mark  ahead  of  Bravo.  I  prefer  you  instead,  anyway!”  
“Paul  Collins  can  you  have  a  stroll  with  me?”  “stroll  on  hill?  wild  animals  can  attack  us!”  Mr  Adewale  impossible  to  explain  his  mind,  rather,  he  deposited  a  sharp  knife  with  me  in  case  wild  animal  attack.  Strange  hills  we  were  seems  unpredictable.  Eyes  from  classmates  of  mine  stared  on  me  especially  as  if  I  was  going  to  death  mission.  Careful  as  we  were,  I  walked  down  silently,  held  Sandra  closer  by  her  arm.  “Be  careful  Sandra!”  she  pant,  stopped,  continue  fighting  down  beside  me.  Sandra’s  sore  eyes  is  a  worry  to  me,  I  refused  to  ask  her  boredom  questions  that  is  enough  to  add  injury  to  her  concerned  state.  “I  think  of  dad,  mom  and  my  siblings  especially.”     “In  a  moment  time,  our  mission  is  going  to  be  accomplished,  have  you  ever  imagined  to  see  yourself  take  photograph  near  series  of  uncommon  animals?  Mr  Adewale  had  his  personal  small  camera  with  him.”  “Paul  Collins  you  stand  on  my  way  as  I  have  made  decision  of  turning  back.”    “4500  km  is  not  a  day  job.  Are  you  planning  to  trek?”  “I  only  need  one  horse  to  accomplished  that  task  of  getting  back  home.”  “So,  you  conclude  walking  anywhere  to  find  concerned  Maasai  that  will  assist  you?”  “cool  water!”  “I-I  suggest  we  both  go  to  rest  beside  it.”  Easy  climbing  hills  change  its  kind  nature,  turned  cruel  by  denying  us  down.  “This  route  Sandra.”  “No.  That  route,  is  easier  there,  than  here.”  We  rambled  down  successfully.  “Shallow  water.  Crocodiles  can’t  hide.  Water  not  deep.”  Beneath  the  hills,  entrance  to  a  place  where  people  may  be  living  was  seen.  “Paul  Collins  someone  helpful  may  be  living  inside!”  “Brave  Maasai,  you  want  to  say.”  “Hello...  is  someone  in?  We  need  your  help!”  “Sh-shut  up  Sandra.  Don’t  jeopardize  our  lives!”  “As  for  me, best  way  to  express  myself  is  what  I  did.”  Safari  park  excursion  had  placed  a  mistrust  on  me  within.  “What  is  this  Paul  Collins?”  “billboard!”  “Welcome  To  Nairobi.  A  place  of  cool  waters!”    “O,  how  delighted  I  am  to  see  sign  of  possibility  of  getting  closer.”  “Safari  park  is  not  situated  near  this  endless  field.  It  can  be  in  the  city.”  I  write  on  sand  to  show  that  visitors  came,  left  a  mark  showing  they  were  not  descendant  of  Kenyans.  “Sing  that  music  Paul  Collins!”  “you  mean  sweet  mother?”  “of  course.”  I  sat  in  the  shallow  water,  Sandra  sat  on  sand  guiding  the  water.    I  start  singing.  I  could  hear  Mr  Adewale  harsh  voice,  shouting  us  back.  While  catching  fun  on  strange  land  we  met,  night  descended  and  spread  her  gentle  dark  thickness  everywhere.  “Are  my  dreaming?  Night?”  “here  is  better  than  there.  Only  that  Mr  Adewale  would  unleashed  his  anger  upon  us.”  “Michael,  funny  boy.”  Sandra  introduced  another  discussion,  eager  to  leave  behind  bunchy  sorrows.  “Yeah.  I  recalled  he  teased  me  in  mood  of  anger.  Believe  me,  I  just  laughed.”  “Dad  saw  how  funny  Michael  is,  last  buck  on  him  went  to  funny  Michael.”  “Dad.  How  do  I  see  him?”  “my  dad?”  “who  else?”  “on  patrol  mission  as  naval  officer.”  “I  shall  one  day  be  a  navy.”  “Intelligent  person  you  are,  not  brave,  your  eyeballs  had  shown  that.”  “Judge  me  not  by  my  eyeballs.  I  am  confident  I  will  serve  my  country!”  “by  then,  I  would  have  been  trained  pilot  flying  across  Africa.”  “Appreciating  choice.  Work  towards  it.”  “Aviation  school  is  next  college  I  must  go  to.  I  enjoyed  watching  airplane  moving  on  air.”  “Roaring  lions.  Hide  beside  this  place.”  Unseen  lions  roaring  not  far  from  where  we  hid.  I  set  the  knife  Mr  Adewale  deposited  with  me.    “Kill  it  if  it  comes  Paul  Collins!”  “trust  me.”  Sandra  watched  to  see  how  courageous  I  can  be  since  I  lay  out  my  intention  of  becoming  a  navy.  “First  test  joining  the  navy  is  braveness.  Show  that  braveness  of  yours.”  Chance  to  survive  is  little  when  faced  with  wild  lion,  I  had  not  even  see  how  mighty  the  lions  are,  full  confidence  rain  on  me.  Mr  Adewale  is  that  person  not  good  to  disobey.  He  won’t  stopped  me  from  going  anywhere.  I  took  that  as  an  advantage,  now,  I  bear  the  consequence  with  Sandra.  Minutes  action  ended,  no  lions  attacked.  I  breath  relief.       “It  had  gone!”  “funny  Michael  he  had  voice  to  mislead  lions  away.”  “Whoa!” “but  he  lies  much.” 
“Michael?”  “one  you  know.  He  argued  that  Mr  Adewale  eats  three  full  grown  turkeys  daily.  I  didn’t  agree  that.  How  can  such  man  having  small  stomach  consumes  three  full  turkeys ?”  “trust  yourself,  don’t  speak  for  others.”  Possibility  of  vision  is  denied,  I  flashed  another  torch  I  carried  along  with  me.  “Dry  woods.  This  matches  may  disappoint,  let  me  give  a  trial!” fire  spread  out,  I  now  hope  is  easy  for  Mr  Adewale  to  locate  where  we  are.  Hours  after  fire  was  set,  the  flames  pushed  up,  gradually  portending  danger.  “Chocolate  girl.  Have  some  chocolates  for  me?”  “I  left  it  behind.”  “Where  actually?”  “bamboo  house.”  “Eh!”  “is  true.”  “Supposing  we  can’t  find  our  way  so  you  mean  we  are  dying  here  of  hunger?”  “chocolates  is  not  enough  to  satisfied  anyone  far  away.”  “But  what  of  if  that  is  the  last  option?”  “it  won’t  still  satisfy.”  “Sandra,  I  believe  you  have  it  in  your  pocket.”  “Check  it  yourself  since  you  have  doubt.”  “Trespass,  I  won’t  do  that.”      “Paul  Collins  ask  me  what!”  “what  Sandra?”  “all  my  packets  of  chocolates  is  for  you!”  “caring  girl,  very  soon,  I  shall  be  having  mouth  pain.”  “I  can  change  my  mind.”  “Change  it  when  I  have  had  consumed  it.”  “Too  many  chocolates  is  harmful.  Finish  two  pieces  no  matter  how  long  we  stay.”  “If  days  past  nothing  change,  definitely  chocolates  shall  be  only  food  I  will  eat.”  “Ask  me  what  again?”  “what?”  “bleeding  gums  traced  to  much  consumption  of  chocolates!”  “another  new  tale.  This  must  come  from  Sandra  TV  network  in  Nairobi.”  “Seriously  it  is  true.  Much  of  it  is  bad.  Even  me,  I  eat  one  piece  weekly.”  “I  learn  new  things  daily.  One  life  I  have  is  prevented  from  going  due  to  ignorance.”  “Wait,  Paul  Collins.  Imagine  if  where  our  pilot  dropped  us  is abode  for  cannibals.  How  do  we  do?”  “moment  of  landing  will  tell.  Strange  creatures  will  gather  to  touch  the  helicopter.  That  would  be  beginning  of  display,  rolling  blades  will  slice  them  quick.     Attack  can  come  immediately  as  the  pilot  departs.”  “Something  tells  me  be  prepared  Sandra!”    “I  will  stay  awake  till  daylight.”  “Tell  me  something  I  longed  to  hear.”  “Cassava.  I  almost  eat  it  daily  during  the  time  I  was  with  mom.  I  chew  raw  cassava,  sometimes,  I  roast  rotten  cassava  as  hungry  increases.  Mom  always  warn  me  of  severe  consequences  of  eating  rotten  cassava.”      “Are  you  farming  before?”  “why  do  you  ask?”  “farmers  badly  hungry  eat  rotten  cassava  on  their  farm.”  “No  money  to  eat  desired  food.  Mom  sleep  hungry  five  times  weekly.”  “And  you  sleep  with  roasted  rotten  or  raw  cassava  in  your  stomach.”  “I  cooked  cassava  during  the  time  our   neighbours  are  through  cooking.”  “Worst  poverty  to  experienced.  Cooking  on  neighbours  fire.”        “I  had  all  sorts  of  names.  Some  neighbours  even  send  me  to  wash  their  dirty  plates.”  “Such  neighbours  are  callous.”  “I  get  chased  with  brooms  for  mistakes.”  “Is  mom  aware  of  that?”  “mom  always  cry,  later,  she  go  pleading  with  the  neighbour  I  offended.”  “Mom  had  bear  pains  for  you  her  son.”  “Sandra,  I  discovered  mom  body  so  wet,  one  evening,  neighbours  did  that.”    “Pour  water  on  mom’s  body?”  “for  me  to  refused  to  heed  to  instructions.”  “Instructions  about  what?”  “carefully  handling  breakable  plates.”  “You  broke  all?”  “I  broke  dozens  of  it.  Working  to  satisfy  twenty-three  neighbours  led  to  that.”  “Is  that  a  charity  work?”  “must  work  if  I  want  remnant  food.”  “Is  mom  aware  dozens  plates  were  broken?”  “I  almost  told  her,  but  during midnight,  she  had  slept.”  “Next  day?”  “I  conclude  it  is  irrelevant.”  “Then,  did  you  embarked  on  vengeance  mission?”  “Sandra,  I  refused  to  work  for  that  neighbour  that  treated  mom  so  low.”    “So  Paul  Collins, if  mom  was  beaten,  that  would  had  been  the  end?”  “Sandra.  Our  neighbours  know  how  quiet  mom  was.  I  caused  it.  That  water  could  had  wet  me,  but  I  wasn’t  around.”  “Any  contributions  during  mom’s  illness?”  “neighbours  that  contributed  gave  me  severe  beaten   if  I  did  an  unpleasant  job  not  worthy.”  “Mom  illness  resulted  them  to  do  that?”  “Yeah!  Yeah!”          “Shit!”  “Sandra  I  can’t  tell  more  of  my  past.  Mom  suffered  pains  I  won’t  forget  easily.  Mom!”                                 
 Disturbing  insects  kept  stinging  me.  Words  were  not  enough,  I  had  to  sleep  since  I  am  short  of  words.  “Paul  Collins  you  got  me  so  annoyed.  I  hate  to  be  troubled.  How  do  I  explain  this  to  my  boss  that  you  and  Sandra  went  without  coming  back?”  Mr  Adewale  ready  for  task  ahead,  his  combat-shorts  were  rough,  dirty,  squeezed.  “Follow  me!”  he  ordered.  “Sandra.  Sandra!”  as  she  heard  her  name  been  called  she  ran,  sleep  were  not  off  her.  “Wait.  It  is  me!”  Sandra  came  begging  for  her  role  she  played.  “I  have  forgiven  both  of  you.  To  the  bamboo  house.”  Much  drama  await  everyone  at  bamboo  house.  Jonathan  turned  wrestler,  tumbling  Michael  to  the  ground.  “Hey,  end  this  nonsense.  I  found  them!”  “Welcome,  Paul  Collins.  Welcome  Sandra.  I  alone  went  far  looking  for  both  of  you.”  “Thanks  Jonathan.”  I  said.  “Michael  are  you  okay?”  worried  Michael  lie  speechless,  he  held  his  head  tightly.  “Broken  bone.  Jonathan  had  broken  the  only  bone  that  gives  me  strength.”  “Hold  on,  I  can  massage  your  bone.  Turn!”  “I  can’t.  I  can’t.”      Mr  Adewale  stretched  Michael  hands,  he  shouted  painfully,  allowing  flock  of  birds  to  run  for  safety.  “Eat,  rest,  I  don’t  think  you  can  follow  us  along.”  Sober  mood  I  put  forward  really  touched  Mr  Adewale.  “I  caused  it.  Michael  had  never  told  me  he  loved  wrestling.  Idled  mind    led  him  to  try  it.”  “Sorry  Michael.  If  I  caused  a  fracture  forgive  me!”  “give  me  that  blanket,  we  need  to  keep  him  away  from  cold.  He  is  weak.”  “How  do  I  get  food  for  him,  sir?”  “I  plucked  lots  of  fruits,  before  I  left  to  look  for  you,  I  told  Michael  to  eat  more  for  enough  strength.”    Mr  Adewale  ironically  abusing  Michael  for  his  sleazy  strength.  “He  shall  be  fine,  I  hope  so.”    “Go  inside  Paul  Collins.  Fruits  await  you  and  Sandra.  Eat.  Eat.”  In,  piled  fruits,  ripe  for  eating  arranged  according  to  its  colour.  “Is  there  fruits  tree  here?  I  am  baffled.”  “Me  also.”  “Maybe  someone  brought  this.”  “Mr  Adewale  would  have  told  you.”  “Why  not  you  Sandra.”  “He  can’t.  Mr  Adewale  prefer  talking  to  you.”  “What  I  did  really  touched  him.  Supposing  I  was  around,  me  and  him  could  had  gone  plucking  this  fruits.”  Twelve  fruits  I  ate  satisfied  me  more  than  eating  five  plates  of  rice.  “Shift  Paul  Collins.  Michael  needs  rest.”  Mr  Adewale  carried  Michael  like  a  baby,  put  him  down.  “Where  is  Jonathan  sir?”  “I  ordered  him  to  stay  alert  in  case  he  noticed  something  strange  coming.”  “Can  I  assist  Jonathan  outside?”  “yes.”  “Sandra  satisfied?”  “Okay  for  now.”  “Assist  me  outside.  Me,  Jonathan  can’t  do  it  alone.”  “Come  together,  let  us  pray.”  As  prayer  goes  on;  Michael  began  turning  side  by  side.  “Michael  is  there  something  bothering  you?”  Michael  refuse  answering  Mr  Adewale.  “Prayer  is  key  to  his  speedy  recovery.  Now,  I  must  increase  the  prayer.”  As  prayer  increased,  Michael  stood  up,  forcing  himself  outside.  “Wonders.  Michael  is  perfectly  okay.  You  can  see,  it  works.”  I  was  unable  to  think  clearly,  it  came  as  big  surprise.  Hag-ridden  state  Michael  present  is  now  over.  “Paul  Collins  is  this  spear  preferable?”   “God  sent  it  here?”  I  asked.  “Searching  for  fruits  made  me  to  see  it.  Brave  Maasai  left  it  beside  that  fruits  tree.”  “My  boss  brother,  Mr  Silas  had  exactly  this  spear.”  “Paul  Collins,  is  your  boss  brother  a  hunter?”  “skilful  hunter.”  “Did  he  taught  you  how  to  use  it?”  “he  never.  Mr  Silas  had  interest  in  me,  he  may  not  want  me  hunting.”  “Precious  spear.  Paul  Collins  I  noticed  one  thing. Royal  mark  on  this  spear.  Only  King  had  mark  on  their  spear.”  “Sir.  I  can’t  argue  what  you  said  but  I  doubt  if  is  true.”  “Take  a  look  at  this.”  Nine  letters  written  in  Kenyan  language.  “Read  it  out  Paul  Collins.”  “I  don’t  understand  Kenyan  language.”  “It  Says—King  Erodo.”  “Sir.  There  is  a  big  problem!”  “no  problem.”  “This  spear  is  for  the  King  of  Maasai.  He  must  come  to  take  it  any  moment.”  “Leave  that  to  me.  King  Erodo  should  ask  himself  how  comes  his  spear  is  beside  the  tall  fruits  tree.”  “A  King  spear.  This  is  splendid.  King  Erodo  must  be  a  great  King.”  “One  day  Paul   Collins.  Do  you  hope  of  becoming  a  powerful  King  with  a  spear  like  this?”  “No—sir!”         “Tie  this  rope  around  the  edge,  hang  it  when  through.”  “Sir.  It  is  heavier.”  “Maasai  warriors  pay  that  price.  Months,  spear  is  with  them.”  “I  now  share  their  burdens.  I  don’t  mind  since  we  are  both  Africans.”  “Good  of  you.  I  wait  to  hear  that.  Up  Sandra,  come  along,  location  of  safari  park  is  our  mission.”  “But  sir,  I  am  inactive.”  “Try  Sandra.  No.  To  leave  you  alone  here  is  big  risk.”                            “Sandra  please  understand.  Stand  up  and  follow  me.”  How  delighted  I  was  to  see  Sandra  forcing  herself  up.  I  wedge  entrance  of  the  bamboo  house  with  a  circular  stone.  Jonathan  stood  in  wait.  His  eyes  focused  on  dancing  trees  afar.  I  checked  around  to  catch  a  full  of  Michael.  Surprisingly,  Michael  had  engaged  himself  in  an  assignment  known  to  him.  “Jonathan,  is  he  alright?”  Mr  Adewale  asked.  “He  needs  clues  about  this  place.  Imagine  sir,  one  person,  by  mistake  hadn’t  pass.  Is  this  ghost  city  I  had  been  hearing  about?  Sir.  Let  us  work  out  solutions.”        “I  had  concern  too.  This  whistle,  take  it.  As  we  walk,  anything  you  spot  by  chance,  don’t  waste  time  to  blew  it.  Paul  Collins  use  this  spear  very  well  in  case  something  happened  to  me.       Guide  everyone  safely  when  I  am  no  more.”  “Nothing  whatsoever  shall  forced  your  life  out.                                   I  must  surrender  my  life  instead  of  yours.”  “Paul  Collins  fight  bravery  when  I  die.”  “I  came  here  for  one  thing,  to  catch  glimpse  of  tamed  animals.  Again,  not  here  to  see  your  end.  I  must  fight  along  for  everyone’s  victory.”  “Got  it  right.  Leader  also  get  injured  as  battle  tensed.  So  carry  on  if  I  fail  to  act.”  “I  found  something!”  Michael  brought  bow  and  arrow  he  removed  from  a  strange  hole  facing  our  bamboo  house.  Arrow  Michael  hold  had  ancient  inscriptions.  “Is  this  place  a  forest  before?”  “mysterious  things  are  still  hiding.  Calmly  it  would  surfaced.”  “Shoo!  Shoo!  Is  this  colourful  bird  sent?”  “either  the  bow  or  arrow  is  rare  sign.”  “It  should  be  good  sign.  King  Erodo  may  had  sent  this  bird  to  monitor  his  ancestral  spear.”  “Bad  sign  if  that  is  it.”  “Paul  Collins  lead  at  the  back.”  Thick  bush  gave  way  as  we  dipped  far.  Slithering  on  marshy  soil  erupted  fear  on  everyone.  “Careful.  Traps  can  be  within.”  “Hamlets!”  I  celebrated  with  my  classmates  as  I  saw  what  humans  lived  in.  Mr  Adewale  collected  bow  and  arrow  from  Michael.  He  set  it  while  moving  forward.  “Paul  Collins  get  in!”  Mr  Adewale  ordered.  Hut  I  entered  was  shabby.  Eroded  mat  on  ground  is  an  eyesore  for  any  stranger.  Elephants  ivories  drooped  helter-skelter.  “Inscribed  words  on  wall.  Kenyan  language.  It  is  a  salutation  to  King  Erodo.”  “What  do  we  do  sir?”  “we  must  avoid  touching  it.  Take  a  look  at  it  rectilinear.”  Mr  Adewale  removed  his  small  camera  from  his  hip  pocket,  snapped  the  ivories,  also,  he  snapped  the  inscribed  words  directed  to  King  Erodo.  “Back  home  I  shall  dwell  in  money.  This  images  in  my  camera  are  worth  dollars.”  “Someone  ran  shortly.”  “Ready  your  spear.  Michael  hold  this  for  me!”  Michael  collected  the  camera  and  watched  images  just  taken.  “Is  there  somebody  trying  something  funny.  I  can  proudly  say  we  here  are  fully  loaded.  I  would  count  one  to  three.  After  that  I  would  shoot.”   Mr  Adewale  Counted  time  expired.  Prowling  owner  of  hut  we  temporally  dwelled  in  refused  to  appeared.  “Certain  clues  can  be  found.  Paul  Collins,  check  next  hut.  Use  your  spear  if  you  are  attacked.”  First  hut  I  entered  linked  to  twenty  huts.  I  was  left  with  my  fate.  Broken  tiny  calabashes  untidy  third  hut  I  entered.  “Have  you  found  anything  Paul  Collins?”  “I  am  still  searching  earnestly.”  Putrid  breathtaking  odour  limit  my  concentration  as  I  get  ready  for  the  unexpected.  “Broken  calabashes  sir!”  “come  out  immediately.  Quick.  Quick!”  I  tumbled  in  a  war-like  way  against  any  planned  attack.  “Figure  it  out  yourself  Paul  Collins.  Tell  me  is  this  hamlets  cursed?”  “cursed  by  who  sir?”  “the  Maasai.”  “For  what  reason  sir?”  “someone  might  had  stole  or  killed  their  cattle.  That  would  prompt  them  to  curse  the  villagers.”  “Are  the  Maasai  fetish?”           “they  lived  a  modest  life.”  “I  understand.  Villagers  dwelling  in  this  hamlets  may  be  hiding.”          
“No.  Paul  Collins;  villagers  dwelling  in  this  hamlets  had  days  meeting  holds.  Meetings  might       be  holding  somewhere  unknown  to  first-timers.”  “Sir,  can’t  we  just  leave  here  and  continue  searching  around  for  safari  park  we  had  been  looking  for?”  “Sandra.  Villagers  is  useful,  to  ignore  them  is  worst  mistake  to  try.  Whether  is  Maasai  or  not,  one  person  I  need  would  be  our  saving  grace.”  “Ho!”  “boys  check  around  gradually;  be  careful,  some  villagers  might  hide  in  midst  of  trash.  Paul  Collins,  be  on  the  lead!”  “consider  it  done  sir.”  We  splay,  as  that  is  best  way  of  achieving  success  when  on  a  mission.  On  my  own,  I  saw  first  clue  that  signified  human  existence  in  that  hamlets.  Fresh  cows  skins  spread  on  dozens  of  clay  pot.  Firewood  kept  at  a  corner  makes  me  again  to  believe  my  guess  is  good  as  right.  Luckily,  I  found  confirmation  of  human  inscription  written  in  English  hailing  King  Erodo  dynasty.  I  bowed,  begging  forward  to  see  the  King.  “Paul  Collins  have  anything  in  your  possession?”  Mr  Adewale  question  farer  is  wanton.  “Not  even  a  sand.  I  am  eagerly  ransacking  wherever  I  can.”  Alone  brings  full  concentration.  Fresh  animals  skins  I  found  tells  more.  Someone  spread  the  skins  not  quite  long  before  we  arrived.  Dry  bones  in  wooden  box  scared  me.  Opening  it,  I  discovered  cattle  bones  were  the  bones  inside  wooden  box  I  found.  Jonathan  walked  by  my  side;  unnoticed  to  him,  I  hid  to  prevent  distractions.  Sheets  of  notes  on  a  small  bench  I  found  in  clandestine  room  also  tells  more,  it  says:  “celebration  for  our  Maasai  King  is  held  annually.  As  demanded  by  my  King,  I  must  leave  a  note  down  when  celebration  is  going  on  somewhere.  This  note  I  write  is  an  honour  to  my  King.  Great  King  ruling  over  the  Maasai,  may  you  live  long!”  the  letter  on  the  bench  create  deep  fear  in  me.  Insults  it  might  be  when  the  King  is  briefed  that  a  stranger  first  touch  the  letter  that  he  should  have  touched.  Convincing  Mr  Adewale  to  change  his  mind  and  stop  us  from  going  further  would  be  irrelevant  since  his  mind  is  already  fixed  to  the  strange  hamlets.  King  Erodo  golden  spear  is  sign  of  respect  to  his  kingdom.  I  hold  it  carefully.  I  could  hear  people  yodelling  happily  in  deep  end  on  broad  daylight.  Codices  in  brown  clay  pot  near  a  semi-  small  room.  “Paul  Collins  be  inquisitive;  clues  is  whatever  you  might  come  across!”  Jonathan  cross-checking  rooms  I  had  entered.  Sticky  cobwebs  glued  my  body  as  quest  continued.  I  was  out  on  a  store  field.  Fresh  milks  lined  up  as  if  it  is  displayed  for  sale.  “Where  are  this  locals?”  Mr  Adewale  asked.  “Sir.  Happy  you  came  before  me.”  “Voices  in  moods  of  dramatic  celebration  encouraged  me  to  sniff  around.  Field,  only  what  I  see.”  “But  sir,  I  can  disguise  and  trace  this  voices  I  had  heard  also?”  “I  like  your  uncommon  courage.  Paul  Collins  I  refuse  to  concur  to  your  request.”  “Where  is  Sandra?”  Mr  Adewale  compelled  me  to  direct  Sandra  to  where  we  were.  Jonathan  accompanied  me;  while  Michael  is  left  with  Mr  Adewale.  Before  I  had  checked  two  huts,  Sandra  appeared  from  nowhere,  scaring  me  by  clasping  her  fist.  “Come  quickly,  this  is  dangerous  game  Sandra.  Full  grown  lions  may  attack  if  you  stay  here  alone.  Follow  me.”  “Is  there  something  I  needed  to  see?”  “Mr  Adewale  instructed  that,  I  should  lead  you  to  the  field.”                “An  old  Maasai  woman  gave  me  milk  in  a  clay  pot.  She  said,  Maasai  called  it  Kule!”  “Sandra  O,  it  might  be  poison.  Tell  me,  where  is  her?”  “I  can’t  say  here,  nor  there.”  Tensions  were  pretty  high.  Mr  Adewale  delighted  to  see  Sandra.  “Stupid  joke  Sandra.  Did  someone  lured  you?”  “old  Maasai  woman  entertained  me.  This  fresh  milk  I  had  drank  had  gotten  me  satisfied.  I  promised  her  I  would  come  back.”  “Paul  Collins  is  it  true?”  “she  also  told  me.  I  never  saw  that  old  Maasai  woman.”  “Celebrations  going  on  would  soon  stop.  The  locals  shall  come  to  their  huts.”     “Their  milks  should  be  left  intact.  Otherwise,  we  can  be  incarcerated.”  “I  support  encouraging  decisions  so  embracing.”  “She  first  called  me  a  poacher.  I  convinced  her  I  am  a  good  student.”     
“How  about  we,  Sandra?”  “trust  me  sir,  I  refused  even  though  I  was  forced  to  mention  names  of  people  with  me.”  “Good  girl.”  “One  suggestion  sir.  As  it  is  now,  let  us  abandon  this  hamlets and  continue  our  mission.”  “Paul  Collins,  yes,  right  immediately!”  hurriedly,  there  is  noticeable  wooden  bridge  facing  a  canal;  Mr  Adewale  pointed  the  easiest  direction  of  climbing  the  bridge.  Gradually  on  it,  I  pant  alongside  my  classmates.  “Easy  boys.  Sandra  be  careful.”  Dead  end  faced  us.  Water  below  flows  violently,  smashing  itself  angrily.  “Am  scared.  I  can’t  continue  moving!”  “Sandra  continue!”  Mr  Adewale  shouted.  Premonition  surfaced  around  everyone.  Current  is  a  good  watch.  Suppose  the  water  needed  single  person,  it  won’t  hesitate  selecting  me  as  right  person.  “Look  elsewhere.  It  is  dangerous,  Paul  Collins!”  long  road  ahead  shortened,  continued  walking  makes  journey  easier.  “Boy  washing  his  cloths  in  river!”  “how  happy  it  is  to  me,  first  Kenyan  boy!”  “Paul  Collins  fix  this  over  there.  Hinge,  they  called  it.”  I  did  as  instructed.  We  swing  down.  “Hey  boy,  shake  me.”  Our  presence  scared  him;  still,  he  continued  as  planned.      “Mr  Adewale  my  name.  This  are  all  my  students  back  home.”  “Kibai.  Kibai.  Your  way  straight,” he  said.  “I  know  Kibai.  All  I  need  from  you  is  assurance.  Is  those  voices  farer  from  a  human?” “Maasai  day.  Join  them  before  it  end.”  “Umm.. is  safari  park  closer?”  “Maasai  can  show  you  that.  Check  that  community  over  there.  Maasai  lives  there.”  “Did  they  have  guns?”  “against  poachers.”  “Strangers  about  to  visit  them.”  “from  far  community?”  “from  far  Kenya.” “Great  day;  King  Erodo  must  be  informed.  I  am  coming.  Wait  for  me.”  Kibai  ran  calling  for  the  King.  “Danger  sir.  Maasai  celebrating  mustn’t  have  us  as  prisoners.”  “He  is  part  to  their  kingdom.”  Vanishing  is  next  thing  doing.  Mr  Adewale  didn’t  delay  that.  Overcoming  all  sums  of  fears  is  possible;  achievement  escaping  death,  Mr  Adewale  knows  waiting  for  Kibai  is  highest  form  of  stupidity.  “Communities.”  Different  women  cooking  evening  food  laugh  near  a  sleeping  dog.      “Sir,  approach  that  tall  woman  sitting  on  bench.”  “Wait  here.  In  case  bad  happens  run  for  your  lives.  That  with  you  is  useful.”  “Bow  and  arrow?  Not  this  place.  Hold  it  Paul  Collins.”  Spear,  bow,  arrow,  short  knife  in  my  pocket  is  a  big  assurance  that  I  alone  may  win  when  attacked. “Jonathan  follow  master  quietly.”  “He  said  we  should  wait  here.”  “I  lead  for  now.  Do  as  I  say.” “Two  captains  don’t  run  a  ship.  Mr  Adewale  is  our  leader  not  you.”  “I  said  do  what  I  want.”     “Is  this  your  ship?  Besides,  if  this  is  your  ship,  Mr  Captain  I  won’t  obey  one  of  that  your  shit  word!”  “cooperation  please.  Disagreement  would  cause  big  setback.  Jonathan  obey  him  now!”   Mr  Adewale  talking  as  if  lecturing  in  a  classroom.  It  seems  most  women  he  spoke  to  never  understand  his  language.  Mr  Adewale  faced  me,  signalling  me  all  is  well.  “Best  opportunity, Jonathan,  we  wait  for  this  moment.  Go!”  Mr  Adewale  sat  talking  with  the  women  refusing  to  understand  his  motives.  “Michael  hold  it.  Be  ready  to  free  it  if  Jonathan  signals.”  “Yes.  Acting  master  I  must  do  as  you  instructed.”  “Sandra  your  knife.  Anything  may  sprung  up.”  “Paul  Collins       I  recognise  your  temporal  leadership.  I  must  act  eagerly  if  you  ordered.”  I  held  a  stick  firmly.      “Weakest  weapon  Paul  Collins.  Use  mine  instead  of  yours.”  “Locals  melt  when  they  are  attacked  with  dry  stick.”  “Locals  fear  guns  than  any  weapon.  It  kills  faster.”  “This  gun  can  kill  ten  people  at  a  shot.”  “Stick  gun.  Where  do  bullet  hide?”  “It  does  not  use  bullets.  It  brings  silent  sound.”    “Mr  Adewale  eating  food  from  locals?  Stop  him  Paul  Collins.”  “Beyond  my  power.  He  said  if  something  goes  wrong  we  should  run.  I  must  fight  to  the  end.”  “Act  fast  Paul  Collins.  Master  is  eating  locals  poison.”  “Master  is  wiser  than  you.  Leave  him  alone.”  Jonathan  also  joined  eating  hungrily.  “Locals  food  can  be  delicious.  Sandra  go,  have  your  share  also.”  “Poison  share,  never.”  Sandra  rejection  a  welcome  appreciation.  Michael  had  even  joined  them  before  I  noticed.          
“Clear  images.  I  must  snap  again.”  “Sandra  you  have  the  camera.  Give  it  to  me.”  “Mr  Adewale  left  it  with  me.  I  am  in  custody  of  it.”  “Sandra  it  is  still  same  you.  Hand  it  unconditionally  to  me.”  “Promise  me  Mr  Adewale  won’t  know  I  had  negative.”  “Which  negative?”  “any  snap  I  take,  negative  of  it  is  with  me.”  “Yes.  keep  snapping  as  you  can.  Trust  me  Sandra  this  is  a  secret  between  I  and  you.”  “Snap  yours  also.”  “Yeah.  Yeah.  Our  leader  in  midst  of  locals.  Best  picture  of  the  week.”  “Mine  should  be  best  picture  for  the  week.”  “Yours  is  all  about  trees,  flowers,  and  distant  images.”  “Wrong.  It  is  about  Mr  Adewale  sitting  near  a  big  cooking  pot  while  he  laughed.”  “Mean  it?”  “of  course.”  “I  need  another  one  instead.  Record  breaking  is  good.”  “Forget  Paul  Collins  I  won.  To  snap  something  like  that  may  take  two  hours.”  “I  shall  delete  yours,  replaced  it  with  mine.”  “Return  Mr  Adewale  camera  to  me.”  “I  won.  I  can’t  give  this  to  you.”  Sandra  forced  it  away  from  me,  camera  we  argued  for  fell  down.  “It  has  broke  Sandra.”   “That  is  what  you  desired.  You  have  it.”  “We  both  desired  it.  We  both  have  it.”  “Carry  it.  Mr  Adewale  can  know  you  broke  his  precious  camera.”  “Set  up  Sandra.  You  lose.  Mr  Adewale  camera  had  been  in  your  care.  I  won  again.”  “In  my  care,  you  forced  it  off  me.  I  again  won.”    “50.  50.  Draw  game!  Blames  is  on  both  of  us.  How  do  we  do  now?”  “good  question  Paul  Collins.  Mr  Adewale  must  definitely  asked  of  his  camera.  Back  me  up  Paul  Collins,  we  shall  lied  that  wild  animals  attacked.”  “Attacked  only  his  camera?”  “okay,  let  me  put  it  this  way.  Wild  animals  chased  us,  his  camera  fell  from  my  pocket.  He  would  believe  if  yes  came  from  you.”     “I  won’t  lie  Sandra.”  “No  choice  Paul  Collins.  Lying  only  possible  option.”  “Camera  how  could  you  break  yourself?”  “broken  camera  can’t  hear.  Do  as  I  say,  that  is  all.”  “Sandra,  proofs  had  vanished.  Dollars  Mr  Adewale  could  had  made  had  gone.”  “Your  fault  Paul  Collins.”  “Why  blaming  me  Sandra?”  “you  did  not  act  maturely.”  “That  is  enough  Sandra.  Our  faults,  our  puerile  manners  is  to  blame.”  “Paul  Collins  master  is  not  there!”  “where  would  he  had  gone?”  “I  can’t  figure  out  where  exactly.”  “In  that  hut,  I  can  hear  his  voice.”  “Michael  signalled.”  “Danger  or  safe?”  “Signalled  safe.”  “Maasai  women  may  think  Mr  Adewale  lost  his  route  in  Nairobi.  A  way  of  assisting  him  together  with  others.”  “Maasai  is  nice  being  with.  This  alone  had  prove  beyond  doubt.”  “Safari  park  we  earnestly  search  for,  Maasai  knows  where  exactly  the  park  is.”  “Not  all  can  have  full  description  of  there.  Maasai  women  may  think  is  all  about  forest.”  “Learned  ones  can  understand  what  that  park  is  all  about.  Yeah!  Schools  students  go  on  an  excursion  to  view  tamed  animals.  So,  the  learned  ones  may  had  gone  compulsorily.”  “How  did  you  know?”  quick  discussions  had  distract  me  from  watching  over  Mr  Adewale  safety  especially.  I  was  nervous  of  Mr  Adewale’s  broken  camera.  He  won’t  take  it  likely  with  Sandra  if  he  knew  about  his  broken  camera.  Mr  Adewale  had  rare  images  he  snapped,  if  presented  for  auctioning  he  would  be  richest  college  coach,  and  tourist  to  have  such  rare  images,  images  of  rare  inscriptions.  I  forced  myself  to  smile.  Difficult  to  smile  when  in  terrible  situation,  I  finally  smiled  all  is  well.  “Answer  me  Paul  Collins!”  “safari  park  is  well  known  by  learners  in  schools.”  “Paul  Collins,  don’t  tell  me  you  were  in  Kenya  before.”  “Whether  before  or  not;  I  am  standing  on  Kenyan  soil.”  “Is  the  soil  good  to  that  of  your  country?”  “excellent  with  that  of  our  country.”  “Supposing  King  of  Maasai  promised  making  you  his  son  to  succeed  him  so  as  to  forget  your  country  would  you  hesitate?”         “Home  is  home.  I  love  my  country  in  West  Africa.”  “Paul  Collins,  King  governing  Maasai  people  would  feel  unhappy.”  “I  can  accept  his  juicy  kingship  only  when  I  am  in  my  country.”  “Money,  lands,  donkeys,  horses,  houses,  cattle,  lots  of  body-guards  would  be  given  to  you.  If  it  is  real  so  you  mean  all  would  be  rejected?”  “on  my  country  soil  I  need  it  but  not  on  Kenyan  soil.”
                                                                            CHAPTER  SEVEN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
“Paul  Collins  I  sneaked  out.  Follow  me  in.”  “Can  I?”  “Yes  Sandra!”  Mr  Adewale  appearance  signified  more.  From  his  calmed  look,  I  agreed  all  is  well.  “She  had  slept.  Jonathan  is  constant  monitoring  her.”  “How  about  Michael  sir?”  “pretending  he  is  sleeping  to  know  all  motives  of  the  women  in  case  they  are  eavesdropping.”  Dark  room  we  packed  ourselves  never  cooled.  As  if  sleeping  hour  is  when  clock  struck.  Women  discussing  earlier  had  started  snoring  harder.  “Sir,  I  broke  your  camera.  Forgive  me.”  “Ouch!”  Mr  Adewale  expressed  pain  in  his  mood  of  curiosity.  “I  could  had  snapped  another  tribe.”  Next  move  been  planned.  Jonathan  monitors  any  strange  movement  around.  “Now,  I  lied  we  are  Kenyans  coming  for  regular  visits  to  check  various  homes  in  various  communities.  Those  voices  from  far  would  soon  end.”  “She  is  in  deep  sleep.”  “Leave  her,  listen  to  me.  From  this  window,  whoever  is  passing  we  can  see  easily.  Understand  this,  Kibai  would  do  all  just  to  show  Maasai  where  we  are.  If  brave  Maasai  come  hunting  for  us  believe  me,  we  have  advantage  over  them.”  “What  advantage  over  people  having  dangerous  weapons  for  animals?  Kibai  may  had  narrate  he  saw  us  holding  ancient  Maasai  spear.”  “You  know  something?  Striking  before  your  enemy  gives  you  victory.  Watch  how  I  shall  strike  against  that  person  that  conclude  we  are  here  for  poaching.”  “Change  your  plan,  sir,  cooperation  can  bring  success  to  all  of  us.  Maasai  that  would  attack  may  want  cooperation  before  attacking.”  “Well,  I  shall  monitored  situations  before  trying  something  funny.”  I  swallowed  my  saliva  in  happy  mood.  “Compass.  I  remember.”  Mr  Adewale  dipped  out  his  round  small  compass  checking  for  slim  route  we  can  pass  without  been  noticed.  “I  am  baffled.  She  said  lions  hunt  humans  on  broad  daylight.  Lions  killed  an  old  Maasai  man  taking  care  of  cattle.  From  that  moment,  locals  hunt  wild  lions.  King  Erodo  became  the  first  warrior,  killing  two  lions  with  an  ancient  spear.  Maasai  proclaimed  him  King  because  of  his  bravery.”  “Hmm... I  suggest  I  return  it  back  to  where  I  saw  it.”  “Leave  this  for  me.”  Handling  issues  with  levity  I  hate  so  much.  Mr  Adewale  remain  relaxed  despite  danger  approaching  not  only  the  community  we  hid  but  we  as  well.  “Paul  Collins  knapsack  can’t  leave  him.  I  like  that.”  “Useful  in  case  of  emergency.”  “Golden  necklace  from  where?”  “Amulet.  An  hunter  gave  me.”  “Sign!”  “about  what?”  “Paul  Collins  check  Jonathan  outside.”  Less  than  a  minute,  Jonathan  entered  telling  something  different.  “Who  are  this  two?”  “This,  Paul  Collins,  that  Sandra.”  “Beautiful  Kenyan  girl.  Sit  on  that  chair,  you  deserved  royal  chair,  manage  that.”  “I  greet  you  in  Kenyan  way  for  your  kind  gesture.”  “Kenyan  citizens  don’t  greet  the  way  you  greeted.  I  doubt  if  really  your  origin  is  from  Kenya.”  Fear  rammed  me  coldly.  Mr  Adewale  short  of  words  makes  him  defeated  to  defend  his  earlier  lies  he  present  to  the  sensible  Kenyan  woman.  “I  am  delighted  being  in  this  room.”  “Maasai  spear?  Maasai  bow  and  arrow?  Every  communities  talked  about  this  missing  weapons.  Return  it  back  this  very  moment.  Pack  things  you  people  brought,  leave  my  room.  Maasai  shall  punish  me  for  betraying  them.”     “Why  not  tomorrow  ma?”  “out  of  my  room!”  I  carried  Maasai  weapons  with  me,  adjust  flexible  knapsack  hanging  on  my  shoulders.  “Paul  Collins  that  is  sign  your  amulet  signals.”  I  can’t  even  speak.  I  launched  into  tears.  “Which  road  exactly?  Compass.  Compass  fail  me  not.”  Direction  of  Mr  Adewale  compass  point  right.  “Hurry.”  “Lions  would  attack.  I  won’t  move  an  inch.”  “Be  in  middle  Sandra!”  ten  hours  walk  challenging;  images  sprung  out  in  an  ambush  way.  “Thirsty?”    Mr  Adewale  himself  in  dire  need  of  water.  “Stream  water  sir!”  “Drain  as  much  all  of  you.”                                              On  my  knees,  I  sank  my  weak  hands  pushing  water  into  my  dried  throat.  Strengths  developed.                         
“Students  another  hill  awaits  everyone.  That  is  only  egress!”  in  college  supposing  a  priest  put  forward  his  visions  concerning  five  frustrating  days  I  would  have  in  Nairobi  I  won’t  delay  snubbing  his  or  her  vision.  Frustrating  days  could  be  ahead;  still,  I  encouraged  myself.  Farmers  had  already  start  to  plough  ridges.  “Thank  God.  One  farmer  among  them  would  be  familiar  with  safari  park  we  search  for.”  Mr  Adewale  is  pliable  so,  I  was  determined  challenging  his  decisions.  “Good  morning  sir.  Sorry  to  have  disturb  each  one  of  you.  We  are  on  an  excursion,  we  toiled  for  one  thing.  Please  where  exactly  is  safari  park  located?”  “from  Mombasa?”  “exactly!”  Mr  Adewale  quickly  answered  to  clear  any  doubts  that  is  capable  of  raising  fears.  “Safari  park  I  had  been  there  for  a  long  time.  Big  animals  play  around  in  freedom.  Is  your  tickets  having  address? Check  it  carefully.”  “I  understand  what  you  mean.  Our  mission  is  to  purchase  tickets  to  gain  access  to  watch  animals.”  “Hold  on,  no  tickets?”  “for  now.”  “I  purchased  my  ticket  four  months  before  becoming  a  guest  to  watch  animals.  Try  to  get  there  as  possible,  in  five  months  time,  your  turns  to  watch  animals.”  “Why  is  there  delays?”  “crowd  all  over  the  world  shower  themselves  for  all  time  memory.  Some  had  purchased  their  ticket  over  a  year  now.”  “Is  there  little  hope  we  can  get  tickets  when  getting  there?”  “Choice  in  a  thin  line.  Is  possible  only  when  quick.”  “Which  direction  to  get  there?”  “that  way!”  “I  am  grateful.”  On  porous  ground  we  move  ditto.  “Climb  gradually.”  “Termites!”  circled  by  termites,  I  looked  around  if  divine  help  can  come.        “It  is  stinging  my  ankle!”  Mr  Adewale  lighter  was  quick,  termites  about  weakening  my  ankle  smell  flames  spreading  out  on  dry  grass  Mr  Adewale  pushed  to  their  direction.  Hurtful  termites  confused  while  fighting  for  survival.  “Should  I  chase  after  them?”  “for  what  reason?  Journey  is    fresh.”  Tempting  crest  sweet  to  rest.  Mr  Adewale  took  an  object  like  telescope  pushing  it  to  his  left  eye.  “Man  feeding  his  cattle.  Arid  lands  surrounded  by  thick  bushes.  Yes,  this  direction.  Fast!”  journey  route  easy  for  once.  Mr  Adewale  confirmed  what  he  saw.  “Hello!”  “How  can  I  help  you?”  “safari  park  closer?”  “look  through  the  eyes  of  this  animals.”  Mr  Adewale  rub  his  palm  on  a  cow  facing  him.  “I  need  your  help.  For  days  it  had  been  difficult  finding  safari  park.”     “Do  as  I  say.”  “No  need.”  “Listen  carefully.  This  five  cattle  are  ill.  All  I  want  is  an  assistance.  Can  you  understand  animals  mind  through  their  eyes?”  “Job  of  Vet  doctor.  Take  them  there  before  they  die.”  “I  will  do  all  I  know.”  “Who  is  this  boy?”  “My  intelligent  student  too  smart.”  “Moo!  Moo!”  Cattle  watching  me  replied.  “How  often  do  they  eat  daily?”  “three  times.”  “Feed  them  five  times.  Their  reply  shows  five  of  their  silent  cattle  are  sick.”  “Surprise,  for  months  this  cattle  had  never  utter  any  sounds.  Such  an  amazing  person  you  are.  Your  name?”  “Paul  Collins.” “Vet  doctor?”  “college  student!”  “have  experience  with  animals?”  “during  the  time  I  was  with  my  mother.  Lots  of  animals  are  under  my  care.  I  learnt  their  various  languages.”  “what  do  you  aspire  to  become  in  life?”  “I  want  to  be  a  seaman.  Protecting  my  country  waterway  from  oil  theft,  piracy  at  all  cost  is  all  I  want.”  “Your  dream  shall  come  to  pass.  So,  I  don’t  know  where   I  can  get  a  Vet  doctor.”  “Early  morning  grass  would  cure  their  illness.”  “No  cost?”  “that  is  all.”  “Safari  park  is  2  miles  away.  I  am  part  of  Maasai  tribes  men.  Kakenya  is  my  name.  Poachers  comes  unexpectedly  to  steal  our  cattle.  We  Maasai  say  no  to  poaching.  By  chance  have  any  of  you  come  across  poachers?”  “not  even  one.”  “King  Erodo  had  placed  a  reward  for  whoever  catches  poachers.”  “Trust  us,  we  won’t  delay  to  report  presence  of  poachers  on  your  lands.”  First  Maasai  man  we  came  across  waved  as  we  continued  our  mission.  “Paul  Collins  that  was  clever  of  you.  He  begged  for  answer;  you  gave  him  all  he  want.  I  see  animals  understand  communications.  Animals  loved  someone  that  reads  their  minds.  Give  me  a  warm  handshake.”        “Dirty  hands,  you  deserved  clean  hands  to  shake  you.”  Avoiding  myself  from  shaking  Mr  Adewale  burst  out  unexpectedly.  “Wash  your  dirty  hands,  Paul  Collins.”  “If  coming  across  water   I  must  wash  my  hands,  thereupon,  I  shall  shake  you  sir,  if  given  that  rare  chance.”  Reason  for  refusing  to  have  a  warm  handshake  with  Mr  Adewale  is  his  slow  thinking.  The  first  Maasai  man  we  met  is  sensible.  If  I  didn’t  use  my  discretion,  he  would  concur  we  came  poaching.  “Wrong  way,  we  need  to  get  back  over  there.  An  image  stand  far  away.  This  telescope  can’t  be  wrong.”  Journey  is  strenuous  any  moment  Mr  Adewale  led.  Days  had  diminished;  taking  bathe  something  of  the  past.  Snakes,  lions,  tigers  or  any  creeping  animals  would  prevent  any  of  us  from  doing  the  mandatory.  “Paul  Collins  take  a  look,  confirm  it  yourself.”  “Gigantic  statue  of  a  Maasai  man.   Michael  see  for  yourself.”  Three  of  us  were  right,  an  image  afar  shows  humans  are  living  not  too  close  from  where  we  are  getting  to.  Focused  eyes  were  restless,  short  expectations  high.          In  our  minds  having  same  thought  that  very  moment  is  reasonably  welcomed.  “Sir,  ambush  is  closer.  People  in  this  communities  desperately  hunting  for  poachers.”  “Shut  your  mouth  Paul  Collins.  Poaching,  a  criminal  offence  I  know  that.  Not  here  to  poach.  I  must  defend  everyone       of  us.”  “But  sir,  spear  owned  by  King  of  Maasai  had  been  too  long  with  me.  Explaining  how  it  got  to  my  hand,  I  can’t.  Maasai  hunting  for  poachers  may  be  prowess  in  catching  their  enemies.               Legendary  spear  with  me  would  put  me  in  trouble.  I  need  to  throw  it  away.”  “Try  it  and  see  the  other  side  of  me.”  Two  offence  we  carried;  first  is  suspected  offence  to  poach  on  Kenyan  soil.  Second  is  offence  of  stealing  King  Erodo’s  spear,  his  bow  and  arrow.  “Somebody  kept  that  image  as  a  trap.  Trick  too  late  trying.  Poachers  would  fall  easily  for  that  precious  image.  As  for  us,  here  on  an  excursion.”  Speculated  image  of  Maasai  stand  unshakeable  while  I  stand  for  almost  thirty  minutes  watching.  “This  is  awesome!”  “Kenyans  are  great.  Such... precious  image?  How  I  wish  camera  was  with  me.  I  would  had  snapped  fifty  of  it,  making  me  famous  tourist  having  rare  photos.”  “C-Caravan!”  “Paul  Collins  where  did  it  lain?”  “fifty  walk  from  here.”  Mr  Adewale  ran,  making  me  to  walk  faster  just  to  catch  up  with  him.  “I  can’t  believe  this.  Well  built.  Come  in  time.”  Mr  Adewale  called  rest  of  his  students  as  he  get  fully  set  to  confront  any  attack.  “Pull  off  your  shoes.  It  is  sacrilege  coming  with  shoes  on  this  soil.  “One  minute  after  I  have  had  entered.  Paul  Collins  open  to  see  if  I  am  being  held  captive.”  “Sir.  Wait,  is  anybody  in?  We  need  help!”  “Owner  of  this  caravan  may  be  dead.  Waste  of  time  shouting  Paul  Collins.”   “I  don’t  think  so.”  Sandra  spoke  in  clerical  voice.  Suspicious  caravan  hide  in  between  fresh  tall  grasses.  Mr  Adewale  entered  undisturbed.  Our  sharp  wide  open  eyes  fixed  at  the  entrance  of  the  caravan.  “Come  inside.  Come  inside.  Beautiful  home  to  live!”  Mr  Adewale  yelled.  Dark  settees  arranged  for  visitors  on  one  side.  Dwellers  settees  beside  two  rooms  facing  each  others.  “Temporal  home  for  twelve  hours.”  “Safari  park  not  in  my  mind  for  now.  I  love  Nairobi.  I  must   stay  even  helicopter  arrives.”  “Michael,  mission  must  be  accomplished.  Beautiful  place  like  this  won’t  deter  me  from  achieving  our  desired  goals.”  “Master.  I  found  this  rifle.”  “Then  who  is  in  control  of  this  caravan?”  “Maasai.  I  believe  it  is  them.”  “Paul  Collins  show  me  how  smart  to  use  this  rifle.”  “Tweak  here,  bullet  will  go  straight  to  the  right  target.”  “Liquor  sir.  Big  back  pocket  attached  to  each  settees  had  liquors.”  “Let  me  read  instructions  about  this  liquor.  99%  alcoholic.  Punctured  cap.  Taste  it.”  “I  don’t  sir.”  Mr  Adewale  poured  massive  liquor  into  his  mouth;  he  is  gradually  listless  in  journey  ahead.  “Join  in  this  merriment.”  “What  merriment  sir?”  “No  ambush  from  anyone.  Drink  Paul  Collins.”  Leader  I  trusted  betrayed  full  trust  I  had  for  him.  Nobody  far   home  must  know  Mr  Adewale  drank  alcohol  in  Nairobi.  “Sir,  stop  drinking  it.  It  is—wrong!”  
I  was  flustered.  Speaking  to  Mr  Adewale  doesn’t  worth  it.  I  shook  my  head,  about  coming  with  a  pensive  idea.  “Michael,  he  is  drowsy  what  can  I  do?”  “tired  man,  allow  him  to  rest.  He  is  unable  to  withstand  such  prolonged  journey.”  I  stand  at  my  elbow  while  pulling  a  long  face.        I  licked  my  lips  focus  at  him,  he  was  gradually  dossing.  “Team  work  would  be  needed.  Michael  monitor  each  movement.  Blink  of  any,  don’t  hesitate  signalling  me.”  Crack  shelf  beside  the  right  settees  carried  documents  too  many  to  read.  Closer,  there  laid  a  big  artwork,  intricate  designs  attractive  to  watch  for  decades.  Liquor  Mr  Adewale  drunk  really  baffled  everyone.  Mysterious  caravan  dwelled  alone  undisturbed  on  coarse  ground.  “What  a  beautiful  picture  of  Maasai  man?  Is  this  King  we  await  to  see?”  “He  is.  I  believe  he  is  the  one.”  “Is  this  planned  work?  King  Erodo  residing  in  caravan?”  “problem  with  that?”  “just  surprised.”  “Where  is  this  rifle?”  “on  Mr  Adewale’s  lap.”  “Protecting  ourselves  should  be  major  priority.  Did  you  heard?”  “heard  what?” “Clasp  of  hands.”  “Each  locals  rushing.”  “To  where?”  “inside  caravan.”  “Enter  fast  as  you  can!”     “Mr  Adewale  should  be  informed.”  “Wake  him!”  I  instructed.  Mr  Adewale  not  affable,  his  face  soaked  with  sweats.  I  hurtled,  hid,  using  cotton  demarcating  two  rooms  the  caravan  had.  Scary  blast  hit  the  entrance  door.  I  melt  in  fear.  “Open  or  else  we  shall  force  it  open!”  “identify  yourselves!”  “authorities  against  intruders.”  “Michael  should  I?”  I  asked.  “Zero  choice.  We  better  open  before  our  punishment  increases.”  In  fearful  state  I  opened  boldly.  “People  stealing  our  animals.  Our  ancestors  had  placed  heavy  wrath  on  all  of  you!”  I  snuffled  all  for  sake  of  Mr  Adewale.  “Check  that  room  if  someone  is  hiding!”  warble  tone  each  henchmen  displayed  really  cool  down  my  state.  “One  only.”  “Bring  him  out!”  Doubts  doubled  in  their  minds.  Destruction  begun  to  confirm  no  one  is  hiding.  “Intruders,  poachers  dwelling  on  our  land  our  King  must  decide  your  fates.  Start  praying  in  little  minutes  remaining.  Once  judgement  is  pronounced  I  for  long  never  see  that  persons  like  riffraff  watching  me  escaping  severe  punishment.”  He  gave  his  short  provocative  barking  laugh  after  end  of  speech.  Open  discussions  among  the  henchmen  panic  Sandra.  As  only  girl  we  carried  along  fear  had  been  building  deeper  in  her  since  our  arrival  in  Nairobi.  Mr  Adewale  awoke,  discovered  strange  muscular  men  surround  him  eagerly.    “Reality  show.  Wonderful  statures.”  “Leader,  wild  lions  prefer  eating,  sleeping  vagabond!  Reserve  another  sleep  till  when  each  lions  fights  to  have  you  in  their  belly.”  I  remained  where  I  was.  Plans  of  escaping  can’t  be  reached.  Muscular  henchmen  numbering  twelve  beat  their  chests  and  held  live  celebrations.  “Tie  their  hands  backward!”  their  curious  leader  instructed.  “For  what?”    Mr  Adewale  got  his  slap  of  his  life  for  asking  question  increasing  his  offence.  “Stars.  Stars.  This  is  what  I  see.”  Mr  Adewale  could  bear  the  pain  alone.  “For  decades  we  had  desperately  tried  catching  poachers.  I  set  this  caravan,  positioned  liquors  at  back  of  each  settees.  I  advised  our  King  liquor  can  be  of  help.  This  is  it.  it  worked!”  another  celebrations  another  happiness  took  their  day.  Mr  Adewale  recovered  seeing  clearly.  He  eyed  me.  He  gazed  around  for  escape  route.  “That  would  be  difficult.  I  can  read  your  mind.  I  am  a  mind-reader!”  youngest  one  among  them  declared  his  profession.  “Move  forward!”  innocent  slaves  on  a  neutral  soil  I  wept  silently.  Route  easier  since  we  were  guarded  by  brave  muscular  henchmen  determined  slaying  wild  animals.         “I  forgot  something  Korinko.”  “Get  it  as  fast!”  we  stopped  till  he  arrived.  “Where  did  this  came  from?”  Korinko  asked.  “From  the  caravan!”  “is  it  for  you?”  “Yes.  No.  For  someone.”  “Criminal!  King  Erodo  owned  it.  Stealing,  offence  number  three.”  “Mercy.  Show  mercy.  Allow  this  innocent  ones  to  go.”  “Be  silent  or  I  silence  you!”  I  frowned  pretending  to  watch  Sandra’s  plight.  “Gourd  I  carried  is  filled  with  water.  Who  is  thirsty  amongst  you?”  none  of  us  replied  joyous  Korinko.      Many  children  jumped,  some  were  impassioned  in  the  community  leading  to  palace  of  King  Erodo.  “Poachers  tormenting  our  cattle.  Children  have  them.  Do  something  against  them!”  “Change  your  decision  Korinko.  King  Erodo  would  launched  his  blames  upon  you  if  this  offenders  are  injured.”  Excited  children  in  community  we  were  rubbed  their  palms  on  our  back.  “Let  your  heart  beat  faster  now.  King  Erodo  palace,  here  we  come.”  Coming  closer,  a  fascinating  beats  of  gong  almost  deaf  each  eardrum  we  have.  Korinko  prostrate  before  a  man  been  decorated  with  monarchical  apparel.  Golden  crown  fixed  on  his  head.  “Your  majesty,  we  have  them  in  our  hands.”  “Tell  me  degree  of  offence  this  quiet,  panicked  people  had  committed.”  “Speak  for  yourself  intruders!”  Korinko  yelled.  “Actually ... no  crime  is  committed.”  “Stupid  idiot.  Addressed  the  King  as  your  majesty.”  “Pardon  me,  your  majesty!”  surprised  King  Erodo  shook  his  head.                                        “Your  majesty.  Far  distance  we  came  from.  I  am  a  Nigerian.  This  students  also  citizens  of  Nigeria.  Excursion  brought  us  here.”  “Your  majesty  their  leader  is  lying.  Check  this  your  majesty.  It  is  your  spear.  Your  bow  and  arrow  giving  to  you  after  that  big  lion  you  killed.  Of  course  your  majesty.  This  spear  especially  is  mandatory  to  show  each  communities  whenever  annual  celebrations  is  held  for  your  reigns.”  “Feathers.  Where  can  I  locate  their  feathers.”  “Your  majesty  which  feathers?”  “Korinko.”  “Yes  your  majesty.”  “That  feathers  this  people  used  to  fly  from  their  country  to  Nairobi.”  Pang  destabilised  Mr  Adewale’s  face.  “I  understand  your  majesty.  Maybe  they  came  through  airplane.”  “Korinko.”  “Yes  your  majesty.”  “Is  it  that  thing  that  move  on  the  air.”  “Your  majesty  as  if  you  knew  it  better  than  me.”  “Ask  them,  what  brought  them  from  their  country  to  Nairobi?”  “I  obey  your  courage  your  majesty.  Head  of  intruders.  Where  is  your  means  of  transportation?”  “helicopter  brought  all  of  us  here.”  “Helicopter?  Where  is  it  now?  Tell  me  so  that  I  can  free  all  of  you.”  “It  has  gone  back  home.”  “For  this  lie,  I  promise  this  shall  lead  you  all  direct  to  dungeon.  Truth  can  set  you  free.”  “Soonest,  helicopter  will  come,  carrying  us  back  home.”  “Eh,  stop  that.  You  all  shall  be  highest  prisoners  in  dungeon  kept  for  offenders.  I  forgot  your  majesty!”  “forgot  what  Korinko?”  “to  say  they  poach  also.”  “Poachers?  I  must  placed  severe  judgement  on  them.  Ask  them  Korinko,  did  one  of  them  sneaked  into  my  well  guarded  kingdom  to  steal  this  spear,  bow,  arrow?”  “long  live  your  majesty.  Precious  spear  on  your  servant  hand  is  seen  resting  beside  one  tall  fruit  tree.  I  honoured  your  spear  I  can  call  also  a  sword.”  “Amulet  on  his  neck?”  “youngest  one  among  them  wore  amulet  surprising  me.”                         “Untie  them  Korinko.  Young  great  boy.  Amulet  worn  by  only  one  prince.  Who  are  you  young  boy?”  “Paul  Collins.”  “Is  this  man  poaching  our  animals?”  “Mr  Adewale  cannot  do  that.  He  is  trusted  fellow.”  “Excursion  where  exactly  to?”  “safari  park.”  “Am  so  sorry.  I  now  bear  blame  for  this  misunderstanding.  Korinko.  Take  them  into  my  palace.  Treat  them  like  our  own.”  “I  will  your  majesty.”  King  Erodo’s  last  word  led  to  a  crescendo.  “Here,  sit,  relax,  food  would  be  ready  by  now.”  Local  milk  in  rotund  bowl  brought  before  us.  “Korinko  doing  work  five  servants  can  do.  King  Erodo  loved  animals.  He  must  follow  you  people  to  watch  animals  playing.”  “Korinko!”    “long  live  your  majesty.”  “Excuse  me.  I  want  secret  talk  with  my  guests.”  Korinko  left  King  Erodo’s  guest  room.  “Mr  Adewale  confident  leader.  Have  you  heard  that  word  Maasai  before?”  “Of  course  your  majesty.”  “That  spear,  also  serving  as  sword  had  written  inscription.  Kenyan  language  only  Kenyans  can  understand.”  “Interesting.”  “Paul  Collins.  I  want  someone  like  you  be  as  brave  as  me.  Timid  ones  don’t  put  on  amulet.  Maasai  warrior  you  would  be.  Sit  closer  me.”           Sumptuous  animals  skins  already  on  floor  I  sat.  Fine  animals  decorations  really  interest  my  stay.*        “Kenya  beautiful  place  in  Africa.  Place  of  cool  water,  Nairobi  beautiful  city  to  dwell  in  anytime.”  Korinko  dashed  bowing  before  the  king.  “Sorry  to  disturb  you  your  majesty.”  “Go  on  Korinko.”  “Entertainers  prepared  for  traditional  music.  Can  they  come  in?”  “Guests,  Maasai  musicians  wants  to  entertain  you  people  with  Maasai  songs.  Give  them  this  hour,  believe  me,  Maasai  musicians  would  be  best  musicians  music  you  all  will  ever  heard.”  King  Erodo  did  not  know  I  can  sing.  Unforgettable  music  I  sang  in  Kenya,  titled  sweet  mother  cannot  easily  erased  from  my  classmates  memory.  Mullet-styled  Maasai  entertainers  entered,  all  head  low  in  presence  of  the  king.  Low  tone  Maasai  musician  commenced,  clapping  their  palms  in  appreciation.  Each  Maasai  musicians  apprise  our  presence  in  Nairobi.  “Our  guests,  their  music  is  talking  about  history  of  Maasai.”  Short  hilarious  Maasai  women  impressive  in  skills  with  viva voice.  Large  earrings  pendent  on  their  noses.  While  progressing  with  their  melody,  a  chap  make  an  acrobat,  holding  six  tambourines.  He  kept  it  beside  the  Maasai  singing  passionately.  Melody  tambourines  in a trice  thrilled  my  night.  Prancing  Maasai  musicians  smiled  warmly.  Two  guards  stand  at  back  of  King  Erodo  fanning  him  with  big  needled  feathers  of  peacock.  “I  want  good  rest  guests.  Hence,  I  must  rest  in  my  palace  room.”  King  Erodo  chamberlains  led  him  into  his  room.  Guards  also  follow  King  Erodo  further.  Weakness  fast  harder  on  King  Erodo’s  face.  His  old  age  slows  words  from  his  abated  mouth.  Weary  state  King  Erodo  is  battling  with  slow  his  steps.  Maasai  musicians  ended  as  wall  clock  struck.  Korinko  dropped  some  coins  into  their  open  palms.  They  took  their  small  tambourines  and  left.  “Hot  meals  before  sleeping.  Servers  bring  it  in!”  appetizing  meals  served  in  trays.  One  swallow  alone;  I  felt  I  could  forget  what  brought  me  to  Kenya.  Mr  Adewale  subdued  his  meal,  sweating  profusely.  “Korinko  this  meal  is  delicious.  I  ate  such  meal  in  Nigeria,  my  country.  Can  I  ask  for  something?”  “as  our  kingdom  guest,  free  to  ask.”  “More  meal  left?”  “servers  must  bring  another  one.  Demand  more  as  you  can.  Paul  Collins  still  want  more?”  Korinko  had  been  keeping  close  at  me.  He  want  more  satisfaction  for  me.  “I  need  more.   delicious  meal  I  won’t  forget  easily.”  “Girl  another  plate?”  Mr  Adewale  responded  pronouncing  Sandra’s  name.  Korinko  amazed  Sandra  had  wonderful  name.  “I  prefer  more.”  “Servers  bring  more!”  more  meals  were  served  so  piled  up  as  if  our  stomachs  was  having  drums.  Within  short  minutes  of  consumption  we  back off.  Korinko  never  sat  until  he  see  full  satisfaction  on  us.  “Fine  room  for  guests.  Follow  me  I  will  show  it  to  each  of  you.”  I  judged  the  Maasai  as  local  tribes;    but  temporal  room  assigned  to  me  really  speak  volume  about  Maasai.  Well  placed  rug,  plain  white  clothes,  soft  pillows,  spreading  mosquitoes  net,  standing  cupboards,  TV  set  baffled  me.                                      “Maasai  prince  enjoy  your  room,  don’t  hesitate  to  call  me  in  case  you  need  something  I  can  be  of  help.”  “Thank  King  Erodo  for  this.  How  about  others,  do  they  have  good  room  as  I  have?”                                “King  Erodo  ordered  I  should  assign  his  prince  this  room.  Paul  Collins  your  room  is  the  best.                                Others  have  a  bit  okay  room.”  “Not  as  beautiful  as  this?”  “not  as!”  “okay  thanks.”  “We  see  next  day  Paul  Collins,  prince  of  Maasai.”  “I  appreciate.”  Korinko  left  eagerly  making  me  believe  he  has  another  assignment  with  King  Erodo.  In  amazement  I  walked  round  quadruple  corners  comparing  beauty  I  saw  with  that  of  my  master’s  room.*  Maasai  drawings  disapprove  sleep  that  refuse  coming.  King  Erodo  is  a  clever  king,  he  must  do  within  his  reach  for  him  to  make  me  his  prince,  Korinko  face  exposed  all.  Thud  knock  sliced  another  amazing  drawings  I  about  watching.  “Korinko  back  for  an  information?”  “Paul  Collins  is  me!”  Mr  Adewale  traced  room  I  was,  sniff  round,  shook  himself  approvingly.  “Paul  Collins,  prince  deserved  this  room.”  “Sir.  King  Erodo  instructed  Korinko  to  give  me  this  room.  He  called  me  his  prince.”  “Lucky  boy.  Amulet  on  this  thin  neck  of  yours  saved  us.  I  can’t  stop  thanking  you.  See  you  next  day!”  Mr  Adewale  left.               He  closed  the  room  quietly.  Sleeping  as  prince  on  bed,  praying  for  more  stay  in  Nairobi,  I  love  to  see.  Exactly  9:00 on  broad  morning  I  jumped  off  my  feet,  ran  checking  if  I  was  actually  on  another  dream.  I  smiled  since  it  is  a  reality.  “Such  can’t  be  a  dream.  Live  experience!”  “How  was  your  night,  prince?”  “Korinko  from  where?”  Surprisingly  King  Erodo  stood  in  middle  of  doorway.  “Paul  Collins  elephants  is  waiting.  Inform  others  to  get  ready  for  safari  park.”  “I  greet  you  sir,  your  majesty.”  King  Erodo  stretched  his  hands  to  accept  greeting  from  me.  It  took  me  two  minutes  getting  myself  ready.  I  try  to  meet  up  with  King  Erodo’s  preparedness;  I  looked  about  for  Mr  Adewale.  “Paul  Collins.  King  Erodo  is  waiting  for  you.”  “Can  I  inform  others?”         “I  have  inform  them.  For  now  they  are  fully  ready  on  their  elephants.”  Coming  outside,  giants  elephants  shaking  to  move.  “Korinko  lift  him  on  his  elephant.”  I  sat  grinning,  wondering  how  our  elephants  can  take  us  far.  “Sandra  don’t  panic!”  King  Erodo  begged.  Korinko  with  four  others  guarding  King  Erodo  as  his  elephant  move.  King  Erodo  talking  to  his  colourful  parrot  standing  on  his  left  shoulder.  On  elephant  I  catch  welcome  sights  of  nomadic  communities.  Movement  is  slow  as  we  approached  dead  end.  “Look!”  I  turn  left  to  see  what  alerted  Sandra.  A  bleak, swampy  stretch  soggy  landscape,  wind-swept,  devoid  of  human  habitation  of  any  sort.  Coming  closer,  resort  of running  animals  of  same  family  catch  everyone’s  attention.  Something  baffles  me,  there  was  trace  of  human  existing  there  before,  tall  signpost  really  tells  of  that.  I  sighed  deeper.  Korinko  walked  straight  to  King  Erodo.  Silent  discussions  going  on  between  King  Erodo  and  Korinko.  “Get  down  from  your  elephant!  My  king  has  said  he  want  his  prince  and  others  to  see  rocks  welcoming  strangers!”  carefully,  I  jumped  down  helping  others.  Mr  Adewale  walked  to  the  dusty  trails  leading  to  the  rocks.  “This  crevice  is  dangerous  for  anyone  to  sit  on,  the  crust has  expose  the  crack  part.”  “Mr  Adewale  sit  on  your  elephant.  Others  do  the  same.”  King  Erodo  has  given  orders  to  Korinko  for  us  to  move.  On  elephants,  excitement  grew  higher.  In  a  minute;  rocks  we  near  to  gaze  at  became  bigger.  Our  elephants  boom  from  anger.  “Size  of  each  rocks  panicking  them.”  King  Erodo  explained.  “How  long  is  this  rocks  existing?”  again,  each  elephants  boom  while  shifting  back.  “Two  hundred  years  ago.”  “Students.  It  seems  fauna,  flora  might  be  existing  on  this  rocks  about  cracking  off.”  Mr  Adewale  statement  were  lucid.  “King  Erodo  have  important  thing  to  say.”  “Tourist.  Mount  Kilimanjaro  not  far.  Time  may  not  permit  me  to  give  others  to  Korinko,  he  knows  there.”  Sandra  mute  still  watching  each  rocks.  Mr  Adewale  forced  down  accosted  by  Korinko  to  be  careful.  “Students  watch  as  I  go  under  this  particular  rock.”        I  rub  myself  fearing  for  Mr  Adewale’s  life.  I  knew  if  something  happens,  King  Erodo  would  want  me  and  others  to  stay  forever  in  Nairobi.  Mr  Adewale  crawled  out  unhurt.  He  threw  a  small  stone  up  the  rock.  His  target  is  his  explanation.  We  understand  what  he  meant.  Foundation  of  that  rock  he  just  came  out  under  is  too  strong.  “Fast  Mr  Adewale.  King  Erodo  is  exhausted.”  Loyal  Korinko  said.  Weather  was  humid  on  road  to  safari  park.  “Your  majesty;  hold  on.  Hold  on.  I  should  be  through  in  next  couple  of  minutes!”  Mr  Adewale  shouted  alerting  King  Erodo  of  his  willingness  to  finish  in  due  minutes.  “Sir.  King  Erodo  is  too  old  to  stay  hesitantly  in  sun.”  “Paul  Collins  I  agree  with  you.  Am  so  tired.  Give  me  an  handkerchief.”  Near  from  our  spot,  clasp  of  hands  from  Korinko  showed  a  clear  signal.  It  is  right  time  to  move.  Mr  Adewale  carried  himself  up,  sat  on  his  elephant. King  Erodo  had  lose  patience in  Mr  Adewale  teachings.  Camera  snapshot  would  have  been  great  benefit  supposing  we  have  one.  Our  elephants  ride  on  smoothly.  Korinko  passed  water  to  me,  I  signalled  him  I  was  okay.  He  went  straight  giving  Sandra  and  others  water  to  quench  their  taste.  “Korinko.  This  elephants  need  water  also.”  “Stream  not  too  far.”       Last  elephant  walking  majestically  was  elephant  I  sat  on.  Slowly;  our  elephants  trumpet  scarily  making  King  Erodo  gasping  for  breath.  Sandra’s  elephant  displayed  final  weakness  by  refusing  to  proceed  forward.  “Sandra  just  sit,  don’t  shake!”  I  pull  down  in  desperate  mood.  I  never  allowed  Korinko  to  show  delay  concern;  rather,  I  hold  Sandra  down  taking  her  up  my  elephant.  Bland  journey  became  worry  for  me.  “Stream.  Down  from  your  elephants,  direct  them  to  drunk  litres  of  water.”  Clean  stream  tempt  me.  I  bent  lower  swallowing  water  my  stomach  can  carry.  “Korinko  move  on!”  once  King  Erodo  commanded  his  trusted  henchman,  it  is  final.  Korinko  obey cautiously.  Journey  continue  immediately  Korinko  moved. Harrowing  journey  make  me  sobbed  out  legendary  tears  in  which  I  can’t  explain  cause  of  it.  King  Erodo  pat  his  elephant  to  stop.  Korinko  ran  inquiring  reason  for  his  King  stopping.  “Prince.  I  feel  your  tears.”  He  snarled.  King  Erodo  would  not  stop  calling  me  his  prince.  I  imagined  if  he  really  had  a  son.  “Korinko  important  personal  word  with  the  prince.  Help  me  down.”  Four  others  assisted  Korinko  lifting  down  King  Erodo  from  his  exhausted  elephant.  King  Erodo  walked  towards  me,  paused,  shook  himself. “I  have  a  boy  not  bold  as  you.  Soonest,  where  I  rule  we  shall  both  get  there.”  “Your  majesty. Son?  Tell  me  something.  Why  do  you  prefer  to  call  me  your  prince  instead?”  “right  from  when  I  saw  your  amulet.  I  concluded  you  shall  rule  before  him.”  “How  about  the  queen,  your  majesty?”    “she  is  in  main  palace  with  timid  son  of  mine.”  “Which  location  is  that  palace?”  “two  minutes  walk,  we  shall  be  there.”  King  Erodo  want  us  firstly  in  his  main  palace  before  he  tells  us  where  safari  park  lies.  “Paul  Collins  smile,  almost  there.”  King  Erodo  on  his  elephant  as  he  lead  briskly.  Nearer,  I  smell  presence  of  villages.  A  tall  darker  in  complexion  haggard  old  man  on  colourful  wrapper  waiting  to  welcome  the  king.  Bald  head,  big  ear-rings  on  his  nose,  he  hold  a  tall  bent  stick  which  I  believe  he  is  Maasai.  “Lekufon  standing  to  welcome  his  king.”  King  Erodo  voiced. “He  has  arrived! He  has  arrived!”  Grosses  villagers  trooped  out,  eager  to  welcome  their  only  king  controlling  Maasai  kingdom.  I  refrain  from  coming  down  until  I  get  full  assurance  that  villagers  coming  towards  us  won’t  attack.  Conga  beats  all  over  as  King  Erodo  came  down  happily.  “Paul  Collins  follow  me.”  I  now  forced  down  after  others  had  been  waiting  to  see  me  land  down. “Is  he  one  of  us?”  Lekufon  asked.  “On  an  excursion  from  Nigeria.”  Lekufon  growls.  “How  is  my  queen?”  “doing  well.”  “Lemasolai?”  “prince  Lemasolai  is  doing  well  also.”  Lined  up  elephants  that  carried  us  squeaked.  Maasai  elders  in  squabble;  opportunity  walking  to  see  situations  around.  Somehow,  while  gazing  around,  one  Maasai  elder  saw  shining  amulet  on  my  neck  swinging.       “He  is  prince  linked  to  a  kingdom.”  He  shouted  alerting  Lemasolai  and  the  queen.  “Prostrate  before  him.  Two  prince  in  our  kingdom.”  King  Erodo  welcomed  by  his  son,  wife  and  servants.  “Your  majesty  who  is  this  boy  that  put  on  amulet?”  “prince.”  “But  Lemasolai  also  have  same  amulet  with  him?”  “Yes.  Two  prince  would  succeed  me.”  “Second  prince  I  welcome  you.  From  where?”  she  asked.  “From  Nigeria.”  Maasai  queen  jealousy  grew  wilder.  “Korinko  prepare  five  rooms  for  them.”  “I  will  your  majesty.” King  Erodo  snuggled  me,  kissed  me. “Rain  fall  seven  years  ago.  Your  coming  here  would  bring  luck.”  Mr  Adewale  not  recognised  like  I.  Any  short  statement  he  is  about  making  would  be  snubbed  by  King  Erodo.  “Crops  refuse  growing.  Farmers  had  shed  their  frustrations.  Advice  me,  what  is  next  option?”  “rain  would  fall.  Farmers  would  laugh.”  Thunder  screams,  an  heavy  downpour  took  over  the  village.  Korinko  used  light  umbrella  to  protect  us  including  his  king.  Palace  guards  wait,  directing  King  Erodo  to  sit  on  his  royal  chair. “Our  crops  would  grow.  Paul  Collins  prince  of  Maasai  you  are  great!”  queen  of  Maasai  frowns  at  me.  Her  son  who  is  direct  prince  never  bothered,  he  sat  with  me  on same  embroidered  mat.   “Your  majesty,  jubilations!”  “Korinko.  Farmers  are  expressing  much  happiness.  Leave  them,  I  know  they  must  parade  themselves  to  meet  me  in  my   palace.”  Stupendous  night  for  King  Erodo,  farmers  flushed  in  rapidly  all  prostrating  front  of  King  Erodo.  “Meitikini  head  of  farmer  this  day  a  reality  you  wished  for. Celebrate  anyway,  age  is  not  friendly  with  you.”  “Your  majesty, Strange.  This  strangers  brought  luck  to  our  entire  villages.”  “See  him.  He  is  the  one  that  predict  rain.  Another  thing  Meitikini,  Paul  Collins,  prince  of  Maasai  promised  farmers  would  laugh.  I  can  see  that.”  “Our  women  had  stored  enough  water  for  days  ahead.  Empty  pails  had  brimmed  your  majesty.  Thank  you  for  allowing  our  strangers  to  come  to  your  palace.”  “Meitikini  greet  other  farmers.  Make  them  understand  I  also  share  their  happiness.”  Meitikini  left  warmly.  “Korinko  flute.  Entertain  our  prince,  also  our  strangers.”  Flute  played  on  orders  from  King  of  Maasai. I  glance  watching  how  Korinko  was  displaying  his  talents.  Pellucid  sounds  led  dozens  villagers  in.  Villagers  passim  expressing  their  gratitude.  Loud  celebrations  continued  till  next  day.  King  Erodo  had  left  his  royal  chair  to  take  his  bathe.  Korinko  led  each  of  us  to  the  bathroom.  I  finished  bathing,  wearing  a  Maasai  apparel.  Mr  Adewale  funny  in  his  Maasai  apparel.  Korinko  played  flute  for  King  Erodo  as  he  sat  on  his  elephant.  Randomly  set  as  we  sat  on  well  fed  elephants. “Safari  park,  oh  I  must  visit  there  again!”  King  Erodo  expressed.  Proximity  of  safari  park  not  far,  King  Erodo  eyeball  tells  that.  His  smiles  make  me  join  him  smiling.  Eddies  of  wind  blew.  Like  itinerant  with  no  fixed  destination;  King  Erodo  direct  his  elephant  timely.  Pusillanimous  Sandra  losing  interest  on  the  journey.  Outskirts,  unseen  animals  noises  heard.  “Korinko  gently  get  them  down.”  On  foot  King  Erodo  led.  Korinko  again  played  his  flute  making  King  Erodo  smiling  along.       Pick-ups  drove  past  King  Erodo.  “Moving  vehicle?  Safari  park  closer  I  see.”  “Sleeping  animals  in  cage.”  “Which  cage  sir?”  “cage  that  pick-up  is  carrying.”  “Sure  sir?”  “perfectly  sure!”  Sandra  had  zoophobia  in  her.  Her  worry  increases  when  Mr  Adewale  confirmed  the  pick-up  that  passed  us  was  lifting  a  cage  which  animals  is  in.  “Korinko  stop.  I  need  concentration.”  King  Erodo  spotting  every  nooks  and  cranny.  “I  was  there  months  ago.  Is  somewhere  along  here.  Korinko  accompany  me  anytime  I  intend  coming  to  watch  animals.”  “Your  majesty  how  I  wish  I  followed  you  that  day.”  Our  elephants  steps  large  enough  on  sandy  ground  can  become  a  threat  for  wild  animals  tracing  everyone.  “Korinko  this  students  want  something.”  “This  pouch  carried  food  that  is  okay  for  your  students.”  “Now!”  “your  majesty  this  side  is  befitting  for  our  guests.”  “Allow  Paul  Collins,  my  prince  to  eat  much.”  Rush,  desperations,  eagerness  forced  me  eating.  Sandra   sat  on  sandy  ground  refusing  more  food.  King  Erodo  gist  alongside  Korinko  his  right  hand  henchman.      “Paul  Collins  look  up  in  case  Orube  pass,  helicopter  is  too  fast.  He  may  had  search  desperately.”    “Boss  would  unleashed  his  anger  on  Mr  Stingy.”  “Is  he  the  pilot?”  “for  approving  unqualified  pilot.”  “Orube  is  qualified.  His  displaying  skills  when  bringing  us  to  Kenya  really  melt  me.”        “Be  against  him.  Who  else  to  join  me?”  Five  in  number  as  we  came,  our  hands  up  against  Orube.  King  Erodo  shook  himself  up,  inquiring  reasons  for  our  hands  up.  I  expresses  clear  anger  I  have  against  Orube.  “Prince  on  your  elephant!”  I  obeyed.  Elephants  continued  from  where  they  stopped.  Maasai  tribesmen  in  moving  pick-up  hailing  King  Erodo  gallantly.  Ten  pick-ups  carrying  Maasai  tribesmen  coming  faster  stopped,  welcoming  King  Erodo.  Sandra  screams  joyfully.  She  longed  to  set  her  eyes  on  tamed  animals.  “Your  majesty  no  ticket?”  “free.  No  charge  for  a  king  and  his  followers.”  Greetings  made  in  Maasai  way  confirmed  King  Erodo’s  recognition.  Guides  leading  us  by  batches.  King  Erodo  instructed  Korinko  to  stay  outside,  watch  over  the  elephants.                                 Pick-up  having  a  grinning  Maasai  driver  stay  in  wait,  ready  to  drive  to  where  tamed  animas  are.          
“Paul  Collins  we  are  at  the  safari  park.”  It  could  be  full  reality  hearing  growls  from  tigers.  Maasai  guides  led  us  in.  I  sat  with  Mr  Adewale  back  of  moving  pick-up;  Maasai  safari  park  driver  had  already  taking  others  in.  Civets,  antelopes,  lions,  chimpanzees,  rhinoceros,  cheetahs,  zebras,  having  unstoppable  funs  in  various  homes  they  live.  Thunderstruck  to  watch  lions  playing  with  lots  of  cubs,  lioness  flays  defenceless  tiny  creatures  for  her  cubs.  Parched  late  afternoon  after  a  strenuous  boring  journey  on  an  elephants;  I  gravitated  to  full  viewing  location  as  I  was  accompanied  by  Maasai  guides  holding  spears  in  readiness  for  any  unexpected.  King  Erodo  sat  on  a  carried  bamboo  chair,  his  dedicated  henchmen  sweating  simultaneously.  Three  Maasai  guides  corking  their  rifles  as  each  stand  side  by  side  so  that  suspected  animals  would  not  pounce  the  old  king.  Maasai  guides  speaking  lingoes,  some  feeding  a  male  wounded  leopard  spreading  out  his  quivering  tongue.  “King  Erodo  want  me  to  take  you  to  where  funny  animals  dwelled.”  I  responded,  climbing  height  of  unmoved  pick-up.  Mr  Adewale  Joined  in,  sitting  beside  excited  safari  park  pick-up  driver.  Fast  moving  pick-up  stopped  as  the  pick-up  driver  noticed  chimpanzees  throwing  their  babies  up  and  catching  it  back.  “Can  I  come  closer?”  I  asked  anxiously.  “Watch  as  I  carry  their  babies.  The  giant  chimpanzees  would  shake  me,  I  forgot  bringing  bunches  of  bananas  for  the  little  children.”  Mr  Adewale  followed  guide  that  brought  us.  Chimpanzees  playing  with  Mr  Adewale;  some  dipping  their  friendly  hands  in  Mr  Adewale  pockets.  My  heart  skipped  a  beat.  Scene  around  was  pure  magic.  I  estimated  hundred  lonely  chimpanzees  rushing  to  have  their  handshake  with  me.  A  pick-up  carrying  Sandra,  Jonathan  and  Michael  heads  to  our  direction.  “Sir,  they  have  joined  us.”  “Very  good. We  have  to  be  together.”    “Telescope.  View  farer.”  “May  I  know  you  more?”  “Olekorinko.  Nothing  more.”  With  calm  mind  he  gave  me  telescope  used  for  viewing  unpredictable  animals.  “Paul  Collins  give  me  let  me  watch.”  Sandra  instructed.  I  chuckled,  gave  her  Olekorinko’s  telescope.  Maasai  guides  standing  by  our  side  exchanging  pleasantries  with  safari  park  driver  that  lifted  Jonathan,  Michael,  Sandra  to  where  we  were.  “An  ambush!”  Sandra  screamed.  “Fast,  I  want  to  watch  myself!”  matured  lions    slow  and  methodically  forms  crept  across  the  hillside,  lay  in  wait  for  unprotected  tamed  animals. “Olekorinko  lions  about  rushing  animals  in  this  park!”  Olekorinko  whistled  Maasai  guides, rushing  were  imminent.  Sounds  of  released  bullets  heard.  Huge  wild  lions  scuffled  with  tamed  matured  lions.  I  spotted  ten  deaths  of  safari  park  oversized  pride.  Gentle  animals  fleeing  for  safety.  Recumbent  approach  of  Maasai  guides  saved  more  lions  death.  Sodden  terrain  behind  hillside  helped  Maasai  guides  in  shooting  five  wild  lions.  Sensing  danger  they  escaped  with  serious  wounds.  Telescope  showing  panorama  passing  eyes  by  eyes.  Maasai  guides  with  Sleight  of  hands  protect  more  animals  from  the  escaped  wild  lions.  Brave  Maasai  guides  slinking  in  case  another  wild  animals  want  another  death  of  tamed  animals.  “Helicopter!”  Orube  had  traced  where  we  are.  He  landed  in  midst  of  cheetahs  causing  panic  among  them  because  of  the  sharp  blades.    “Come  faster!”  as  fast,  we  entered  into  the  waiting  helicopter.  Unknowingly,  King  Erodo  coming  faster.  He  came  face  to  face  begging  Orube  to  allow  me  live  in  Kenya  forever.  Orube  refused.  “Paul  Collins,  please!”  “I  am  a  Nigerian.  I  am  proud  to  be  a  Nigerian.  I  am  going  back  to  achieve  my  aim  of  becoming  a  trained  seaman  to  protect  my  country  waterway  from  piracy,  oil  theft.”  “Bye!”  “thanks.  Your  Majesty,  bye!”  helicopter  lift  up,  took  us  back  to  our  college.  Orube  has  already  pleaded  for  mercy  just  for  dropping  us  in  wrong  place.  Mr  Collins  took  me  home,  Hillary,  Georgina  prepared  sweet  meals  for  my  arrival  safely.  David  happy  I  was  back.  “Paul  Collins,  no  boarding,  resume  your  secondary  class  tomorrow.  Rest  in  your  room  as  you  like.”  
                                                                              CHAPTER  EIGHT                                                                                                     
                                                                                BACK   HOME                                                                          Home  is  home;  there  is  no  place  like  home.  Mr  Collins  talking  with  me  in  smiling  mood.  Striving  against  all  odds  in  Kenya  would  remain  a  memory.  “Boss,  challenges  I  had  in  Kenya  depresses  me.  Orube  caused  it  all.”  “I  arrived  successfully  from  Congo  yesterday.  Imagine,  I  was  told  about  excursion  I  wasn’t  briefed  about.”  “Boss.  Your  guess  really  worked  perfectly.”  “What  guess?”  “my  coming.”  “Mr  Thomas  phoned  the  pilot,  threatening  him  with  all  punishment  within  the  court  of  law.”  “I  smell  sudden  appearance  of  Orube,  he  was  sweating  as  he  landed.  Fear  in  him  led  him  landing  in  midst  of  cheetahs.”  “Paul.  Mr  Stingy  is  dismissed  indefinitely!”  “boss  for  what  manner  of  offence?”  “permitting  bad  manners  in  college  he  ought  to  have  prevented.”  Boss  expressions  shows  all  is  not  smooth  in  college.  “Boss,  I  am  surprised  Orube  landed  in  college,  gloomed  atmosphere  panicked  me.”  “Trust  me.  I  instructed  Mr  Thomas  to  tell  Orube  to  land  on  where  he  carried  you.”  “I  almost  ran  into  where  I  stayed.  Horn  from  your  car  frozen  me.  Mr  Lawal  is  too  dedicated.”  “He  has  to  because,  I  pay  him  daily  allowance.”  “Nice  boss  you  are.”  “Paul  we  have  one  significant  thing  to  discuss.  Remind  me  when  I  am  alone.”  “I  must  boss.”  “Paul  how  happy  it  is  for  me  to  see  you.”  Hillary  expressing  her  temporal  likeness  towards  me.  I  know  later,  within  weeks,  her  nagging  attitudes  must  burst  out.  “Georgina  had  prepared  your  usual  room  cleaned.”  “Thanks  Ma’am,  grateful  for  that.”  David  sat  opposite  Me  looking  hopeful.  I  see  stress  on  him.  Absence  in  boss  house  has  change  things  within.  “Paul  wait,  tell  me,  where  actually  source  of  money  for  that  excursion  came  from?”  “money  they  gave  me  for  winning  gold  trophy  was  used  for  the  excursion.”  “Gold  trophy?  How  much?”  “$30000!” “too  much!”  “$15000 was  used  for  other  thing.”  “Funny.  Used?”  “Students  protested  they  need  sporting  facilities  to  promote  their  talents.  Mr  Stingy  agreed  he  is  using  rest  $15000 to  purchase  an  equipments.”                                       “Mr  Thomas  knew  all. In  fact,  a  student  came  warning  Mr  Thomas  right  in  his  office.  That  led  to  Mr  Stingy’s  dismissal.”  Boss  face  looked  broken,  merely  staring  at  him,  I  can  see  his  displeasure  for  allowing  me  being  in  college  alone.  “Paul  excuse  me,  I  have  urgent  call  to  make.”  Turning  back,  I  see  Hillary  following  boss  and  demanding  to  know  secret  conversation  boss  needed  to  have  with  me.  “David  have  something  unusual  for  me?”  “well... what  did  you  think  I  have?”  “boss  private  conversation.”  “Paul  pray  boss  won’t  sent  you  packing!”  “Boss  is  not  such  type!    Besides,  I  did  nothing  wrong!”  “wait  and  see.  As  he  was  back  from  Congo,  he  was  complaining  bitterly  about  nothing.”  “You  know  what?  I  can  pinpoint  what  led  to  his  rare  complain.  He  loved  me.  From  Congo  he  must  had  been  thinking  about  his  well  trusted  housekeeper.  Boss  worry  is  his  housekeeper  safety  in  Kenya.”  David  began  swallowing  his  saliva,  expressing  his  bitterness  towards  ways  he  was  usually  snubbed  even  though  he  worked  so  hard.  “Paul  I  was  employed  before  you.  Boss  have  never  appreciate  whatever  good  work  I  did.  Why?  Why?  Will  I  get  any  reward?”  “someday  somehow.  Boss  must  enrol  you  in  college.”  “I  only  want  pay  rise.  Family  I  left  behind  depends  on  me.”  “Send  this  for  them.”  “Whoa!  Paul  big  money!”  “Poor  Paul  you  knew  is  now  bucks  up!”  “would  I  be  like  you,  Paul?”  “choice  in  a  thing  line.  Do  you  prefer  working  from  morning  till  night?”  “for  what?  even  if  I  earned  five  times  my  salary  I  won’t.  Boss  know  I  don’t  work  extra  hours.”  “Extra  hours  working  boss  like  me  for  this.  By  chance  I  heard  boss  discussed  his  plans  for  me.  He  insist  schooling  is  best  for  me.  Reward  of  hard  work.”                                                    “Paul  I  eavesdrop  about  boss  plans  in  regards  to  your  case.  Favours  on  only  you.  Smile  Paul!”              “David  I  believe  on  boss.  When  you  said  I  should  pray  so  as  not  be  sent  packing.  Look  on  my  face  should  have  tell  I  wasn’t  scared.”  “Unexpected  may  still  happen,  Paul.  Don’t  get  yourself  carried  away  with  gladness.”  David  a  fully  jealous  person  that  needed  not  to  be  told  about  secrets.  He  had  flair  for  convincing  anyone  good  about  the  future  for  others  but  he  never  had  faith  about  himself.  “Paul  get  to  your  room!  I  want  confirmation  about  you  in  your  room!”  same  room  I  left  remain  untouched  until  Georgina  arranged  rough,  untidy  sides  on  my  bed.  Clock  struck  midnight.  In  sleep  crow  of  cock  heard.  I  sprung  up  hitting  down;  preparation  is  underway  for  Mr  Lawal  to  take  me  to  college.  Opening  the  door,  new  uniforms  for  new  class,  new  section  had  been  kept  well  ironed,  well  hanged  for  me  by  side  of  the  door.  “Boss  orders,  all  this  for  me  alone?”  “now  you  know!”  boss  standing  far  await  me  till  I  come  out  of  the  room.  His  feelings  towards  his  dedicated  housekeeper  is  to  force  himself  to  see  how  I  would  respond  to  new  uniforms  bought.  “Roundup  faster,  driver  is  waiting.”  “Boss  I  should  be  through  two  minutes  from  now!”  “rare  wisdom  shall  come  upon  you  Paul.”  “So  be  it  boss.”  I  rushed  making  myself  ready.  Light  food  swallowed  down  deeper  gave  more  strengths  to  me.  Within  minutes  after  eating,  boss  car  played  host  to  me.  Mr  Lawal  drove  rightly.  “Paul  nice  to  see  you.  So  it  is  all  about  secondary  school.  I  was  told  you  went  to  Kenya  on  an  excursion.  Why  did  you  prefer   to  come  back?”  “mission  to  fulfil,  mission  to  accomplish.”  “Come  on... what  mission?”  “Mr  Lawal  it  shall  be  known  soonest.”  “Kenya.  That  is  great.  Anything  surprising  in  Kenya?”  “wild  lions  take  on  anyone  they  come  across  on  broad  day  light.”  “Weird!  Wild  lions  roaming?    Is  that  what  you  mean?”  “yes.  From  nearby  thick  bush  humans  come  under  attack.  I  took  everything  careful.  I  even  climbed  a  hill  just  to  prevent  unwelcomed  lions  from  attacking.”  “Warrior  Paul!”  “King  Erodo  begged  I  should  stay  in  Kenya  till  I  want.  He  called  me  his  prince.”  “Prince  of  what?”  “prince  of  Maasai!”  “so  you  saw  them?”  “I  lived  with  them  so  happy.  Only  that  I  want  to  come  back  home.”  “Supposing  boss  maltreated  you,  so  that  means  Kenya  would  be  next  place  you  deserved?”  “boss  is  a  mind  reader.  He  had  not  for  once  provoked  me.  Therefore,  I  can’t  leave  him.  I  think  about  him  mostly  in  Kenya.”  “During  my  young  age,  I  try  getting  out  of  my  country  to  try  other  country.  No  one  assisted  me.  Paul,  so  lucky!”  “I  give  every  thanks  to  my  creator!“  “gotten  there.  Drop  down  carefully.  After  closing  I  must  come  to  take  you  home.”  “Mr  Lawal  I  shall  expect  your  arrival.”  Mr  Lawal  drove  off  hurriedly.  “Paul  Collins!  Paul  Collins!”  students  hailing  their  champion.  I  seems  to  be  seen  like  an  idol  among  crowded  students  coming  aright  to  college.  “Happy  of  your  return.  How  has  journey  be?”  Bravo  asked.  “So  cool  there.  Next  person  is  you  Bravo.”  “Stop  there!  don’t  deceive  me!  Mr  Stingy  trying  to  play  smart  moves  had  been  fired!”  “so?”  “he  paid  price  for  lying.  Next  on  line  is  you!”  “I  have  done  nothing  wrong.”  “Paul  Collins  you  are  also  an  accomplice.  Mr  Stingy  uses  you  mainly  for  lying  to  make  us  believe  all  is  well.”  “Bravo  stop  that  nonsense.  How  is  all  our  classmates?”  “I  won’t  even  answer  until  you  apologise.”  “For  what  Bravo?”  “Paul  Collins  say  the  truth.  Rumours  had  gathered  around  that  I  suppose  to  go  with  you  people.  Someone  explained  how  my  name  was  swapped.  Is  it  right?”  “if  is  proven,  I  never  did  that?”  “I  am  not  saying  it  is  your  fault.  All  I  am  saying  is  that  you  knew  about  it.”  Bravo  want  confessions.  I  have  made  up  never  to  tell  him  all  that  Mr  Adewale  said.  “Mr  Stingy  only  knew  about  that.  Find  him  Bravo,  he  must  tell  you  how  he  did  it!”  “Okay.  Paul  Collins  don’t  be  provoked.  Now  in  another  class!”  “As  you  can  see,  this  uniform  is  for  secondary  section.”  “Won’t  you  check  me  in  class?”  “Bravo Level  had  changed.  Years  from  now, I  would  finish  first  schooling.  I  must  achieve  aims  I  yearn.”                                                                             
Bravo  shook  his  cold  hands  with  me,  from  his  battered  face  he  hope  one  day  to  be  like  me.       I  forced  myself  from  him,  he  refused  leaving  me  for  another  time.  “Bravo  I  must  come  to  see  how  you  do  in  class!”  “Paul  Collins  I  am  still  moody,  dolorous  as  well!”  “I  did  all  best,  now,  I  am  in  full  mood  to  smile.  Secondary  section!”  “Mr  Thomas  is  coming!”  “Wow!”  students  running  to  coordinate  themselves  on  line.  Mr  Thomas  walked  up  to  me, welcoming  me  for  a  safe  return.                               “Tourist!”  first  word  from  Mr  Thomas  welcoming  precisely.  I  greeted  him,  rubbing  my  hand  on  my  sweaty  head.  “How  was  your  journey,  sir?”  “I  should  be  the  person  to  ask  such  question!”                                      “Sir,  I  was  told  you  went  for  your  Masters  Degree  to  Germany!”  “Paul  your  father  scared  me,  right  in  Germany  I  boarded  a  flight  back  to  Nigeria!  Mr  Stingy  didn’t  tell  me  how  many  days  my  students  especially  would  spent.  I  sacked  him!”  “negotiable  matter,  sir,  call  him  back,  he  is  ignorant  of  his  mistakes.”  “Know  what?”  “what  sir?”  “Mr  Stingy  received  bribes,  permitting  corruption  in  this  college  I  took  years  to  see  it  was  free  of  nefarious  activities.”  Pretending  as  if  I  didn’t  know  about  Mr  Stingy’s  cunning  attitude  was  all  I  put  on.  “Sir.  Did  he  confessed  to  it?”  “Paul  I  make  sure  I  conduct  every  investigation  before  I  comes  out  with  final  decision  on  major  issue.  Mr  Stingy  even  confessed  he  take  pleasure  in  collecting  bribes  from  desperate  students  going  to  late  night  clubbing!”  “so  baffled  to  hear  this!”  “violent  students  according  to  him  are  calm  since  I  returned  back  and  effect  some  permanent  changes.”  “Am  too  glad  for  your  sensible  decisions!”  “follow  me  Paul,  your  class  is  all  I  want  to  see.”  Mr  Thomas  direct  me  for  a  new  day  in  secondary  school.  “Sit  front,  that  seat  should  be  your  seat  from  henceforth!”  students  in  class  looked  as  if  a  president  son  has  been  assigned  to  their  class.  Mr  Thomas  spoke  calmly  in  my  ear  that  I  should  see  him  after  closing.  The  teacher  in  class  had  already  started  before  I  entered.  He  is  speechless  until  Mr  Thomas  left.  He  continued  teaching,  making  way  for  clearer  understanding.  I  can’t  ask  of  his  name,  he  would  put  an  eye  on  me  if  I  dare  try  to  do  that.                                        Teaching  is  interesting  with  him,  he  repeat  his  words  timely.  I  turn  back  counting  number  of  us  in  classroom.  We  were  fifteen  in  number.  Two  girls  and  thirteen  boys.  Subject  of  interest  is  that  subject  they  received  with  happy  state.  “Class,  the  fifteenth  student  would  promulgate  his  name  before  I  leave.  Do  you  intend  to  know  his  name?”  “I  want  that!”  “class  monitor,  are  you  on  course  to  answer  for  others?”  “of  course!”  eagerly,  I  divulge  my  name  making  curious  student  in  class  to  make  an  applause.  “I  welcome  this  habit,  your  new  classmate  would  never  lose  taste  of  coming  here.  Paul  Collins.  Mr  Thomas  know  reason  of  bringing  you  among  this  bookworms,  morally  well-behaved,  brilliant  students!”  class  cool  to  the  core.  Students  passing  watched,  to  them  it  seems  no  one  was  in  class  I  was.  “Paul  Collins.  As  class  monitor,  I  approve  decision.  Your  teacher  standing  in  our  midst  is  Mr  Adine.  Whatever  you  don’t  understand  within  his  teaching  meet  him  in  his  office.”  Mr  Adine  staring  at  me  happily.  “Class  would  you  not    entertain  your  new  classmate?”  the  class  monitor  present  a  slim  covered  book  to  me  in  welcoming  manner.  Mr  Adine  left  too  happy.  “Paul  Collins  is  his  teaching  interesting?”  judging  Mr  Adine  on  first  time  may  not  make  sense.  Deep  within  I  formulate  something  reasonable  to  say.  “Perfect  teaching  from  such  a  genius  making  our  day  bright,  Mr  Adine  is  nice  to  be  with!”                                 “really?”  “trust  me!”  class  monitor  speaking  to  me  look  around  faces  in  class,  smiled  as  he  shook  himself.  “Oh!  Call  me—Bege!”  seriousness  on  faces  of  fourteen  students  hit  harder  on  me.                                  Within  six  hours,  four  teachers  had  completed  their  teaching  for  the  day.  Mr  Lawal  drove  in,  making  everything  relevant  I  am  doing  to  be  postponed.  “Paul  come  in  faster!”  all  my  quiet  classmates  stood up, waved  to see  me  in such  glamorous  car they  may  not  have  seen  in  their  life.                                                                                                                                                    
Cruising  home  too  interesting  especially  when  in  Mr  Collins  car,  been  controlled  by  Mr  Lawal.  Secondary  section  having  organized  students  taking  things  calmly.  “Hectic  day?”  “yes  Mr  Lawal.”                                   “Primary  class  over.  See  yourself  different,  step  in  to  overcome  challenges!”  “no  matter  how  rough  it  is  I  must  fulfilled  all  aspirations.”  We  sighted  Georgina  waiting  to  open  the  large  gate  eagerly.  Horning  from  the  car  makes  her  ran  pushing  entrance  gate  open.  I  stepped  out, yawned,   showing  signs  of  tiredness.  “Paul  before  resting,  sweep  all  part  of  main  parlour.  David  is  sluggish  doing  it.”  “Your  wish  must  be  done,  ma’am!”  “Allowed  him  to  rest  Hillary.  Stop  this  cruel  proud  manners.  Paul  is  my  lovely  child!”  boss  mentioned  something  I  considered  perfectly  right  to  hear  within  two  years  of  meritorious  services.  He  loved  to  feel  words  I  utter,  I  know  since  he’s  aging,  and  unable  to  have  his  child  of  his  own  from  Hillary,  he  is  desperate  having  me  as  his  own.  “Paul  is  employed  as  an  housekeeper,  his  duties  still  stands,  if  he  fails  to  act,  I  must  send  him  back  to  that  dirty  place  he  originally  came  from!”  “Hillary  stop  those  stupid  words  you  prefer  saying!”  Mr  Lawal,  Georgina,  looking  focused  at  me,  making  me  to  be  an  abandoned  child  seeking  refuge  in  an  unpredictable  home.  “Boss,  another  service?”  Mr  Lawal  asked.  “Go  home  meet  your  family!”  how  happy  Mr  Lawal  was,  he  dashed  to  avert  any  call  from  boss  or  Hillary.                                 I  took  two  brooms,  sweeping  despite  being  tired.  Hillary  pranced,  directing  every  move  I  made.                                         Boss  flushed  in,  grabbed  the  brooms  off  my  hands,  threw  it  far.  Hillary  Hissed,  calling  David  to  continue  from  where  I  stopped.  Quarrel  about  happening;  boss  a  gentle  man  handled  the  matter  as  head  of  his  family.  “Paul  I  didn’t  forget.  We  shall  discuss  in  privacy!”  that  day,  boss  still  made  mention  of  discussing  with  me.  Futile  statement  to  David  as  he  wait  anxiously  for  that  day  boss  would  tell  all  what  he  has  in  his  mind.  Pediment  on  entrance  door  signals  someone  had  been  making  way  for  smooth  entry.  David  excused  himself,  went  directly  to  lead  the  person  coming  in.  “Father  Arinze  boss!”  Mr  Collins  left  all  he  had  been  doing  in  his  room,  rushed  forward  to  welcome  the  priest  I  never  knew.  Father  Arinze  blessed  the  parlour  he  was,  instruct  me  to  come  have  handshake  with  him.  “Remove  that  amulet.  Burn  it  now!”  I  obeyed  Father  Arinze,  went  outside,  set  the  amulet  I  have  burning.  I  brushed  dirt  off  me,  walked  straight  in.  “Collins  is  this  the  one  you  talked  about?”  “Father  Arinze,  he’s  exactly  the  one!”  “Paul,  want  this?”  boss  would  venture  his  anger  on  me  if  I  refused  collecting  Father  Arinze’s  precious  gift.  “Too  precious  Father  Arinze!”  stunned  by  cross  rosary  Father  Arinze  brought,  he  didn’t  asked  if  it  conforms  with  my  doctrines.  Boss  first  to  bring  out  comments  concerning  rosary  Father  Arinze  gave  me.  Discussions  with  boss  and  Father  Arinze  smooth  to  the  core.  Father  Arinze  bilingual  words  with  boss  cut  me  short  in  understanding  further  discussions  with  boss.  “Paul  I  shall  leave  now.  Later,  I  would  show  you  where  I  live.”  Father  Arinze  white  gown  he  wore  made  him  nifty walking.  “Paul  that’s  the  priest  praying  for  my  family  all  this  while.  Use  that  rosary  all  time.  It’s  helpful.”  I  rubbed  the  rosary  gently  as  I  went  into  my  room.  Daily  schooling  helped  reshaped  attitude  I  was  known  for  in  college.  Bege  and  I  famous  as  bosom  fiends.  Teachers  even  called  us  brothers,  things  I  dire  need  he  gives  me,  making  me  to  do  same  to  him  also.  Boss  knew  Bege  as  best  friend  of  mine,  he  even  visit  Bege  weekly.  Mr  Adine  displaying  his  prowess  as  a  teacher  while  I  was  in  class,  Mrs  Fabian  waited  till  he  finished, inquired  to  know  how  I  am  since  she  saw  me  years  ago.  I  told  her  three  years  of  secondary  not  too  palatable  without  her.  Mrs  Fabian  announced  she  had  stopped  working,  about  travelling  abroad  to  study.  Mrs  Fabian  made  it  clear  her  prayers  were  answered.  God  sent  someone  helpful  to  sponsor  her  and  her  children  to  any  school  in the  world. I  yelled  making  students  to  think  I  am  crazy  while  snuggling  with  her.     
Due  to  stress  in  secondary  school.  I  saw  Jonathan,  Michael,  Sandra,  Bravo  for  long.  Father  Arinze  rosary  part  of  me.  Mr  Thomas  jocular  made  him  to  be  loved  in  and  out  of  college.      Lots  of  privilege  boss  approved,  allowed  monthly  salary  I  receive  doubled.  Cleaning,  sweeping,  a  gradual  past.  Hillary  had  no  choice  but  to  remain  calmly,  she  knew  I  am  progressing,  she  began  reasoning  I  could  be  great  someday,  somehow,  sometime. As  years  I  spent  in  secondary  increase,  popularity  I  had  in  college  brought  awards  to  me.  Final  year  of  schooling,  I  was  appointed  as  an  Head  boy.  I  treated  students  with  clemency.  History  had  it  no  Head  boy  is  soft  as  I.  Conciliating  among  junior  students  I  did  with  impartiality.  Mr  Thomas  hand  full  support  to  me,  sometimes,  I  receive  daily  allowance.  Within  months  of  final  year  in  college,  I  finished  the  mandatory  years  required  for  a  student.  I  came  out  with  flying  colours  in  my  O’ Level  exams.  Boss  so  proud  of  me.  Among  my  fellow  housekeepers  jealousy  grew  higher  than  ever  before.  Boss  bought  ten  suits  for  me.  I  now  wore  suits  exactly  like  the  one  boss  loved  wearing.  Boss  begged  that  I  should  be  controlling  his  consortia  in  which  I  humbly  disagreed.  He  made  it  clear  he  had  taking  me  to  be  his  son  long  ago.  Boss  expect  surprises  from  me.  I  didn’t  show  smiles,  delight,  and  full  happiness.  Boss  asked  intentions  I  have  ahead.  I  told  him  I  want  to  be  a  trained  seaman  with  the  Nigerian  Navy.  Boss  turned  mad  and  promised  to  curse  me  with  forefathers  if  I  don’t  drop  plans  of  becoming  a  seaman.  I  persuade  him  hour  by  hour  to  accept  what  I  want  to  be.  His  anger  turning  to  violent  as  he  broke  anything  facing  him.  Hillary  called  me  an  ingrate  who  had  forgot  past  harsh  living.  I  was  never  deterred,  hence,  I  began  warming  up  for  whatever  happenings  that  might  occurred.  Boss  complained  to  Father  Arinze  on  phone  about  me  refusing  to  heed  to  his  advice.  I  could  hear  clearly  Father  Arinze  promising  to  come,  see  me  personally.  Boss  silently  ordered  David  to  call  me.  I  could  feel  boss  pain  digging  deep  in  him.  “Paul  you  have  created  a  rough  future  of  uncertainty  for  yourself.  Seamen  die  cheaply,  making  them  not  recognised  in  Navy.  Change  your  decision  Paul.  I  would  make  you  Chairman  of  all  the  consortia  I  have  within  two  months  from  now!”  “sir,  boss,  I  can’t  please.  I  thank  all  your  kind  gesture  towards  me,  I  fully  appreciate.”  Angry  boss  ran  into  his  room  grumbling.  Dumbfounded  to  see  his  personal  dark  shotgun  clenched  in  his  hands.  He  pull  the  trigger  at  me,  luckily,  the  dark  shotgun  was  empty  of  bullets.  Boss  again  tried  many  times  but  he  failed  to  deliver.  On  the  process  he  knelt  begging  for  change  of  decision.  I  bluntly  refused  him  nor  to  look  at  him.  Father  Arinze  was  in  unnoticed  to  me.  “Paul  I  came  for  you.  You  know  why?”  “I  guess  it’s  about  future  decision  I  made.”  “Have  you  changed  it?”  “not  at  all!”  boss  in  huff,  held  his  failed  shotgun,  walked  out  of  our  discussion.  “Is  he  about  to  shoot  you?”  Father  Arinze  asked  audibly.                                “Boss  had,  he  failed!”  “give  me  your  credentials.  In  a  week  from  now  expect  any  call  from  me.”                                   I  packed  all  what  I  can  accompanying  Father  Arinze  to  his  white  limousine.  He  left  baffled without  speaking  to  boss.  Three  weeks  later  I  got  a  call  from  boss  phone.  Father  Arinze  alert  I  should  get  ready.  That  day  he  drove  in,  coming  down  from  his  limousine.  He  explained  to  boss   I  am  following  him  to  Naval  basic  training  school.  Politely  I  thanked  boss,  kissed  him  as  I  carried  everything  I  can.  David,  Georgina,  Hillary  waved  as  Father  Arinze  limousine  swift  out  of  the  compound.  “Courses,  to  be  a  seaman.  Your  name  on  list  of  intending  seamen.  I  believe  you  shall  come  out  successful.”  “Father  Arinze  it  is  decision  mom  want  for  me.  I  shall  not  let  her  down”  on  reaching  our  destination  I  pant  for  fear  of  new  environment.  A  security  on  navy  uniform  blew  his  whistle  allowing  his  partner  to  open  the  well-secured  gate.  “Father  Arinze  is  this  your  boy?”  “he  may!”  “welcome  boy  to  Nigeria  Naval  basic  training  school!”  “thanks!”                                                                 
                                                                                 CHAPTER   NINE
                                                                                   THE  MISSION                                                                             Father  Arinze  promised  to check  how  I  am  doing  every  two  months. “Paul  I  support  discipline. So,  I  need  your  cooperation  so  that  you  won’t  be  disciplined.  Goodbye!”  I  could  see  navy  uniformed  security  men  opening  gate  for  Father  Arinze  for  smooth  departure.  Training  exercise  spotted  on  a  vast  field.  Flapping  among  trainees  brace  every  courage  I  have.  “Make  yourself  ready  in  case  you’re  called  upon!”  I  almost  got  melted  when  a  man  walked  pass  where  I  was  standing  to  look  interesting  trainings  going  on  in  the  peak  of  the  cool  night.  A  vehicle  on  routine  checks  stopped  on  getting  to  where  I  was.  “I  guess  it’s  your  new  day!”  voice  of  the  modest  man  sounding  like  the  fall  of  a  gravel.  “I  need  help  sir  to  know  where  I  would  be  staying!”  “come  in  quickly.  It’s  an  offence  to  stand  there!”  clearly  I  could  see  more  tedious  training  while  inside  the  moving  vehicle.  “Wait  here  I  want  to  inform  the  leader  in-charge.”  Serious  night  giving  birth  to  songs  all  around  free  corners.  Crispy  couch  I  sat  makes  a  full  assurance  of  my  coming  to  the  right  place.  Young  men  crouching  as  a  way  of  testing  their  various  fitness.  Standing  up  may  be  an  offence  when  the  deal  is  going  on;  I  was  cautious  not  to  put  myself  in  trouble.  Little  rain  began  dropping,  songs  propagating  as  jogging  was  going  on  beside  me.  Whistle  blown  made  trainings  to  end  for  the  time  been  and  every  smart  looked,  agility,  brave  men  converged  to  another  spot.                                      Desperation  of  becoming  a  seaman  is  all  I  have  within  my  lonely  mind.  Lustre  lights  shines  on  any  object  resting  on  edges.  Wait  was  long,  interesting,  mind-fixed  until  the  man  I  waited  for  surfaced.  “Follow  this  direction,  leader  in-charge  want  to  see  you!”  tiled  floor  came  as  challenge  as  I  almost  slipped  numerously.  Nugget  frame  having  faces  of  patriotic  navies  held  me  on  till  I  got  to  dead  end.  “Come  in!”  offices  locked,  there  is  no  place  that  voice  sprung  from  except  small  speakers  hanging  side  of  walls.  “No  way  in!”  “walk  twelve  steps  backward,  turn  left,  walk  in  straight!”  spirit  cannot  be  speaking  boldly.  Human  speaks  exactly  more  of  that  way  that  voice  sounds.  Panicking  something  of  a  past.  Fear  shouldn’t  be  mentioned  because  it  is  against  the  ethics  of  the  navy.  Following  instruction  given  to  me,  I  succeeded  in  getting  in  touch  with  the  leader  in  charge  waiting  anxiously  to  have  a  glance  of  me.  “Sit  down  on  seventh  settee  backing  you!”  I  wondered  if  something  is  wrong  with  other  settees  he  never  made  mention  of.  How  flat  it  is  when  I  took  control  of  it.  “You  applied  for  seamanship.  Seafaring  is  decision  no  one  can  easily  make.  Nigeria  navy  is  disciplined  and  known  for  disciplinary  actions  against  oil  theft,  piracy  and  illegal  oil  bunkering.  Pipe-line  vandalism  is  also  another  crime.  Have  you  decide  your  mind?”                                   “Years  ago,  I  have  decide  to  be  acknowledged  as  a  seaman!”  “what  type  of  seaman  do  you  wished  for?”  “a  seaman  that  can  work  tirelessly  without  supervision  from  superior!”  “how  can  you  describe  oil  theft?”  it  was  more  of  an  interview  as  I  battled  to  defend  any  decision  I  made.                               “Oil  theft  crime  of  the  millennium!”  “how  about  piracy?”  “crime  of  the  millennium!”  “that’s  what  we’re  against.  This  is  an  academy  once  the  bugler  blew  the  bugle  jump  up  from  whatever  bed  you  are.”  “Is  there  room  assigned  for  me?”  “of  course,  whether  you  came  a  long  way  or  not  there  must  be  room  for  you!”  moments  of  conversation  looking  as  if  I  am  already  enlisted.                                    “Landlubber!  The  sea  must  bring  full  courage  to  you!”  I  cracked  my  brain,  wondering  what  he  meant  by  landlubber.  “Paul  Collins,  I’m  known  with  that  name!”  “your  name  is  on  this  file.  If  your  name  is  not  here,  I  wouldn’t  have  asked  for  you!”  right  there,  main  aim  I  launched  into  increased.  “This  is  your  number  memorize  it  timely!” he  hit  his  desk  signalling  someone  to  come.                                   
A  well-built  man  already  standing  at  my  back.  He  patted  me  so  that  I  should  be  aware  of  him.                                                         “Show  him  his  room.”  “Yes  sir!” entrance  by  entrance  we  passed.  Climbing  a  stairs  I  conclude  is  easy  proved  more  of  a  serious  task.  I  could  hear  students  conversation  well  detailed  in  an  open  room.  “Sneaking  out  in  midnight  means  more  problem  for  any  student  that  try  it.  Discipline  is  still  what  we  stand  for.”  How  tall  the  building  was,  desperate  student  can  still  make  a  move  jumping  down.  “Someone  mental  can  do  this!”  “even  students  normal  had  attempted  jumping  down  before  we  prevented  them  from  doing  it.  Trust  yourself,  don’t  trust  others!”  praises,  worships  going  on  in  a  secret  room  to  prevent  disturbing  from  troublesome  students.  “Exact  place!  am  sure  tomorrow,  you’re  going  to  thank  me!”  as  planned  I  push  one  foot  in  feeling  how  the  rug-floor  was.  “Amazing!  This  room  for  me?”  “keep  it  clean,  I  must  come  every  morning  for  inspections!”  “when  actually  would  you  come?”  “I  shouldn’t  tell  you,  until  you  see  me!”  everywhere  inside  looked  well  arranged.  Already  positioned  pillow  warmed  my  head  when  I  was  on  bed  for  nap.  Violent  knock  woke  me  as  I  could  hear  sound  of  the  bugle.  Confusion  hammered  all  unexpected  thinking  in  me;  I  thought  of  hiding  since  I  was  in  dire  need  of  another  sleep.  If  I  am  caught  that  may  be  serious  mistake  I  have  done.  I  refused  to  try  putting  myself  in  trouble.  “Am  coming!”  hurriedly  I  bounced  out  pretending  I  am  eager  coming  out.          “Problem  for  you!  The  trainer  instruct  me  to  call  you.  Don’t  you  hear  the  sound  of  bugle?”                                              “in  night,  I  can’t  hear  very  well!”  “and  you  didn’t  complained?”  “I  can’t  for  reason  of  fear!”                                         lying  I  hate  so  much;  one  option  I  have  is  to  lie  in  which  I  have  planned  to  do  when  I  am  about  facing  discipline.  Academy  students  all  folding  their  hands  when  I  got  to  where  I  was  needed.  “Bugler  do  it  again!”  eagerly  the  bugler  performed  wonderfully  as  everyone  stand  without  blinking  their  eyes.  I  was  lucky  not  to  be  deaf  due  to  the  high  sound  of  the  bugle.  “Now  you  hear  it  clearly?”  “I  do  sir!”  students  numbering  in  hundred  burst  into  laugh. The  trainer  also  joined  making  me  to  be  free  from  punishment  about  happening.  “This  are  all  the  new  students  in  this  academy.  Paul  Collins  you  came  at  last  hour.  From  now  I’ve  appointed  you  coordinator-five.  Your  mission  now  is  to  check  every  nooks  and  cranny  for  students  hiding  just  to  sneak  out  of  the  academy.  Another  thing  again,  monitor  how  students  are  responding  to  training.  Can  I  trust  you?”  “Yes  sir!  I  must  be  loyal  to  the  authorities  in  this  academy!”  “nice!  Start  your  duty  once  the  bugler  signals!”  the  slim  soldier-like  bugler  blew  the  bugle.  Jogging  began  as  I  followed  students  at  their  back.  Response  appreciating  in  two  hours  of  training.  There  was  passion  in  training  around  the  academy.  “Paul  Collins  this  is  your  whistle  blow  it  now!”  I  did  as  instructed.  Already  tired  students  stopped  gradually.  “Check  if  medical  help  is  needed  for  anyone!”  panting  were  high,  even  me  I  panted  as  it  is  first  time  I  did  training  of  two  hours.  “They  need  help  I  need  help!”  medics  were  informed  in  which  they  responded  promptly.  “Glucose  should  be  okay  for  them!  There  is  no  cause  for  alarm!”  a  concerned  medic  said.  “Exchange  pleasantries  among  yourself.  We  encourage  that  as  good  way  of  knowing  yourself  better  in  case  of  danger.  Paul  Collins  lead  by  introducing  yourself  and  what  you  hoped  to  be  with  the  Nigeria  navy.”  Most  trainees  had  heard  my  name  when  I  was  called  by  our  trainer.  Stupid  if  I  refuse  to  follow  our  trainer  instruction.  I  started  from  beginning  till  I  was  exhausted.  Surprisingly  our  trainer  hand  me  a  microphone  which  assisted  my  crack  voice.  Rowdy  applause  given  to  no  one  but  me.  I  with  ten  others  are  in  same  line  of  becoming  a  seaman.        “Only  ten  of  them  for  seamanship!  Brave  students  or  do  I  call  you  men?” I  quickly  responded  by  speaking  on  behalf  of  others.  “Brave  students!”  I  laid. Our  trainer  checked  his  slim  wristwatch.                                                                                    
He  directed  us  to  go  back  to  our  various  rooms.  On  reaching  the  room  I  leer  at  the  ajar  door.                                “Someone  has  enter!  Someone  has  enter!”  I  made  known.  Scare  not  normal  thing  for  me  doing  at  this  time  of  the  hour.  “Forget  to  lock  your  door?”  “on  an  hurry!”  “that’s  why  I  close  it  half  way.”  “Forgive  me  for  ignorantly  forgetting  to  do  the  usual!”  “that’s  okay,  I  agree  it’s  your  first  night  at  this  academy.  So,  how  is  the  training?”  “training  was  sweet.  I  was  appointed  this  night    unexpectedly  as  coordinator-five.”  “Just  within  hours?”  “it’s  still  a  surprise  to  me.”  “Commodore  Charles  should  be  glad  that  at  last  there  is  now  a  new  coordinator-five.  He  has  been  expressing  his  frustrations.  Commodore  Charles  want  success  for  this  academy!”  “is  he  in-charge  here?”  I  asked.  “No.  He  rarely  come  except  when  on  a  surprise  visit.  The  trainer  must  had  found  favour  in  you.  Right?”  “Umm.. incidentally  he  prefer  me!”  academy  inspector  looked  sourly  wondering  how  lucky  I  was.  “Coordinator-five  this  night  is  yours.  Enjoy  it  as  you  like!”  “no  strength  in  celebrating  the  night.  That  bugler  is  still  not  weary!”  “O,  is  true!  He  takes  students  by  surprise  anytime!”  “inspector  I  should  be  on  bed  by  now!”  “coordinator-five  is  your  parents  coming  anytime  to  check  you?”  “Father  Arinze  would  come  I  can  rely  on  him!”  “nice.  So  your  biological  father  is  a  priest?”  “not  really.  He  doesn’t  even  know  how  to  preside  over  a  church.”  “Then  how  is  Father  Arinze  related  to  you?”  “personal  friend  of  boss  I  worked  for.”  “Has  your  boss  ended  the  contract  both  of  you  have?”  “boss  never  made  mention  of  that!”  “then  how  where  you  allowed  to  join  the  academy?”  “Father  Arinze  applied  for  me  to  join  the  academy.  Sadly,  my  boss  never  want  me  to  join  the  navy.”  “Maybe  that  boss  of  yours  hadn’t  sail  in  his  life.”       “Why  did  you  say  so,  inspector?”  “sailing  on  sea  is  most  enjoyable  part  of  life.  At  least  for  many  years  it  would  remain  sweet  thing  to  remember  for  whoever  did  that.  Coordinator-five  that  your  boss  is  missing!”  “inspector,  is  it  wrong  to  join  your  country’s  navy?”  “if  is  wrong  you  won’t  dare  come  here!”  “I  made  the  nice  choice.  I  won’t  regret  it  no  matter  what.”  I  paused  as  I  think  again  if  I  were  right  with  this  persisting  choice  I  made.  Boss  would  deny  me  if  I  come  back  begging  I  have  no  interest  with  the  navy.  “Coordinator-five  seaman  is  best  for  you!  I  can  see  how  courageous  you  are!”  “does  it  show  on  me?”  “somehow!  Commodore  Charles  also  have  this  eyeballs  and  courage  you  possessed.”  “Inspector  how  can  I  be  compared  with  commodore?  Imagine  a  superior  to  a  subordinate?”  “coordinator-five  all  I  am  trying  to  say  is  that  your  both  eyeballs,  courage  matched  with  Commodore  Charles  own.”  Academy  inspector  seems  to  be  tired.  I  watched  to  see  if  his  eyes  were  dazing  since  he  is  comparing  a  superior  with  a  subordinate.  “Inspector  well  I  agree  we  may  have  same  eyeballs  but  I  don’t  know  him  anywhere.”  Deep  sigh  of  relief  from  academy  inspector  made  me  blew  out  massive  air.  Asperity  of  academy  inspector  coming  down  to  diminish  end.  “I  heard  noises  wait  here  let  me  check  from  angles!”  academy  inspector  is  a  garrulous  person.  Noises  he  heard  led  him  to  end  his  discussions  with  me.  “Paul  Collins  it  is  me.  That  man  won’t  allowed  you.”  “In  fact  that’s  nice  thing  you  did.”  “Paul  Collins  please  let’s  work  together.  Ten  of  us  working  towards  being  a  seaman  should  be  active  in  any  role.”  “Our  trainer  is  clever,  maybe  he  want  to  monitor  if  I  possesses  smartness.  Lovely!  They  called  you?”  “Japtan!”  “mostly  evenings  should  be  used  for  each  of  us  personal  training.  The  academy  should  not  be  fully  rely  upon  for  hidden  skills.”  “Paul  Collins  would  it  not  come  as  a  stress  every  evening  for  our  own  personal  training?”  “Japtan,  we’re  here  for  achievement!  Is  either  you  join  us  or  step  aside.  Nine  of  us  would  train  ourselves  on  special  skills.”  “Paul  Collins  count  me  among.”  “Japtan  it  won’t  be  strenuous  learning  special  skills  coupled  with  training.”  “As  our  coordinator,  I  mustn’t  relent  in  supporting  you  even  if  I’m  not  capable  somehow.”            
Clear  sky  budding  make  way  for  preparation  for  class.  “Paul  Collins  get  prepared  for  class.”  “What  kind  of  class?” “seamanship  class!”  “weird!  Training  is  enough,  I  don’t  think  going  to  class  can  be  of  an  immense  benefit!”  “courses  in  class  shall  determined  whether  we  would  eventually  be  enlisted  into  the  navy.”  “Training  isn’t  mandatory?”  “Paul  Collins  it’s  all  about  physical  and  fitness.”  I  rushed  making  ready  all  I  have.  I  took  two  notes  for  the  class  I  have  no  glimpse  of.                                  “Coordinator-five!”  our  trainer  called  me  loudly.  “Enter  into  the  third  hall,  the  instructors  should  be  waiting.  Identify  yourself  as  new  coordinator-five.”  “Yes  sir!”  easily  recognizable  hall  had  almost  hundreds  students  receiving  lectures  from  two  instructors.  “Do  we  have  someone  new  in  our  class?” “Paul  Collins  raise  your  hand  up!”  Japtan  instructed.  “Commander  Davies  said  there  is  now  a  new  coordinator-five  for  the  academy!”  instructor  on  left  side  adjusted  his  specs  after  waiting  to  see  the  new  coordinator-five.  “Is  he  here?”  “he  is  here!”  Japtan  shouted.  Students  were  much,  timidity  challenging  my  status.  Two  instructors  waited  till  I  present  myself  to  both  old,  new  academy  students  wishing  to  become  enlisted  with  the  navy.  “Coordinator-five  what  is  your  aim  in  this  academy?”  for  twenty  seconds  I  was  speechless  until  I  regained  full  confidence  I  have.  “Checking  for  students  hiding  out  of  the  academy.  Monitor  how  students  are  responding  to  training.  To  work  towards  becoming  a  skilful  seaman!”  praises  were  so  loud  as  students  gave  me  a  standing  ovation.  “Mr  Denver  what  can  you  say?”  “remarkable!”  “coordinator-five  I  would  be  sad  if  I  go  out  here  without  knowing  your  name.”  “Paul  Collins!”  “Great!”  another  round  of  ditto  applause  students  present  assured  me  I  was  on  right  track.  “Can  we  both  continue?”  “of  course  sir!”  front  seat  left  for  special  student  became  where  I  was  led  to  sit.  Mr  Denver  affable  when  approached  about  naval  problems.  4:00  on  the  dot  Mr  Denver  and  Mr  Donovan  the  two  white  instructors  the  academy  had  ended,  promised  coming  back  for  another  topic  four  days  time.  “Japtan  where  are  others?”  “Paul  Collins  wait  here,  I  must  inform  them  our  personal  trainings  is  about  commencing.”  Officers  in  whites  spotted  heading  out  of  the  academy  for  inspections.  “Paul  Collins  they  had  been  waiting  over  there!”  “apologize  on  my  behalf?”  “I  did  that!”  unbelievable  seeing  eight  students  showing  dexterity  towards  training.  “Coordinator-five  is  here!”  Japtan  created  situation  of  recognition  when  I  inspect  each  skills  eight  students  training  towards  being  a  seaman  forced  out.  Stopping  for  ten  minutes  because  we  are  ten  in  number  brought  courage  among  the  timid  ones.  “Form  two  rows,  I  and  Japtan  would  lead.”  Eight  agile  students  forming  two  rows  stand  gallantly. “Crawl  in  swimming  way!”  passionately  they  showed  urge  of  swimming  while  crawling.  “Watch  how  I  will  backstroke!”  Japtan  silent,  wondering  how  I  would  backstroke  without  being  in  water.  “Coordinator-five  you  can,  continue,  continue,  you’re  an  inspiration  to  us!” words  of  encouragements  coming  over  me.  “Is  a  bit  stressful.  Do  it  now!”                                      Japtan  led  eight  of  them  backstroking  sluggishly.  Smooth  floor  passed  air  to  dry  massively  sweats  on  my  body  as  I  sat  panting.  Watching  the  fading  sky  about  turning  dark  I  hesitated  doing.  “Stop!  Come  over  here!”  frowns  towards  Japtan  in  particular  became  a  course  of  concern.  “We’re  here  for  the  fullest,  smile!”  Japtan  smiles  allowed  others  to  forget  how  harsh  crawling  and  backstroking  can be.  “Coordinator-five  is  there  a  word  for  us  before  we  end  today’s    training?”  “look  up  is  already  night!  Trust  the  bugler, he  must  performed  as  expected.  Day  two  would  come  with  another  skills.  There  must  be  a  song  for  ending  our  training.  Japtan,  kindly  sing  song  relating  to  the  navy  for  us!”  Japtan  mouth  dancing,  his  focus  is  how  to  come  up  with  sweet-melody  song.  “This  song  I’m  about  to  sing  is  not  related  to  the  navy!”  “Japtan  no!  Think  something  related!”  sweet  melody  song  led  to  marching.  Tough  day  ended  in  smooth  style.                       
Our  academy  trainers  had  regularly  continue  giving  trainings  to  students  working  towards  achieving  their  various  goals  in  the  academy.  Mr  Denver  introduced  new  topic  after  failing  to  come  according  to  his  promise  with  Mr  Donovan.  “Most  of  you  seems  to  be  a  landlubber.  Coordinator-five  would  you  prefer  going  to  sea?”  “right  now!”  amidst  bursting  laughs  from  fellow  academy  mates.  “Vessel  that  would  performed  the  operation  is  not  available  now.  Commodore  Charles  had  called  for  new  coordinator-five  to  see  how  sea  life  is.” “Is  it  mandatory?”  “once  a  new  coordinator-five  is  appointed,  within  weeks,  there  must  be  vessel  that  would  sail  him  around  on  sea.”  “Mr  Denver,  can  female  be  appointed  as  coordinator-five?”  “for  once,  it  hadn’t  happened.  Coordinator-five  only  for  students  aspiring  to  be  seaman.”  “Others  should  sail  before  me!”  “Commodore  Charles  likes  due  process,  you  first,  nine  others  would  go  later!”  Commander  Davies  walked  into  the  hall,  his  craggy  face,  bald  head  more  scary  to  see.  His  ever  loyal  frowned  garrulous   inspector  followed  him  wherever  he  goes.  An  information  had  reached  him  that  some  students  never  bath  before  coming  to  hall.  Lectures  were  prevented  from  continuing  as  hall  was  calmed.  Commander  Davies  sniffed  our  bodies  not  minding  how  many  we  were.  “Coordinator-five  come  along,  tell  me  who  hadn’t  bathe!”  someone  in  hall  might  begin  to  think  Commander  Davies  had  been  offended  before  coming  to  hunt  for  student  that  had  not  fail  to  comply  with  academy  rules.  “Mr  Denver  are  you  perceiving  any  offensive  smell?”  “not  at  all  Commander  Davies,  here  seems  too  nice  for  that.”  “Let’s  go,  times  without  number,  I  had  warned  you  against  telling  lies  inspector!  Walk  out  here  before  I  lose  my  temper  on  you!”   academy  students  clapped  noisily,  this  is  the  minute  they  long  for,  now  it  went  their  way.      “Mr  Denver  shook  his  head,  scratched  his  curled  head,  rubbed  his  shaky  hand  on  it.  “What  on  earth  can  we  say  just  happened?”  “I  sir!”  Japtan  signalled.  “A  running  nose!  It  need  some  quick  adjustment!”  wondering  students  laughed  passionately.  “Retiring  in  highest  rank  is  pleasurable  but  it  bring  someone  back  to  memory  of  meritorious  services.”  Mr  Denver  continued  to  avert  us  from  creating  an  atmosphere  of  noises.  We  went  for  break  after  twenty  five  minutes  of  lectures  from  Mr  Denver.  “Paul  Collins,  please  explain  what  happened  in  hall!”  “Japtan  where  you  not  there?”  I  could  feel  the  impulse  radiating  on  Japtan’s  coarse  face.  “Our  evening  trainings  is  all  I  think  about  while  receiving  lectures.  Paul  Collins  to  say  the  fact;  that  backstroking  is  too  hard!”                        “to  be  a  seaman  with  the  Nigeria  Navy  isn’t  a  day  job!  Japtan  all  would  be  an  history  one  day!”  “Paul  Collins;  eight  of  them  are  marching!”  the  bugler  had  blew  the  bugle;  attentions  where  not  there,  if  not  I  could  have  understand  something  is  about  happening.  “Let’s  rush  faster,  we  can  still  join  them!”  “Paul  Collins.  Mr  Donovan  would  come  with  his  lectures  soonest.  We  can’t  figure  out  what  he  might  likes  to  make  us  aware  of.”  “Coordinator-five,  join,  join!  Commodore  Charles  can  send  his  spies  to  monitor  if  you  and  nine  others  are  training.”  Seamen  song  on  ship  dig  deeper  in  our  ears,  our  trainer  had  formed  a  song  for  only  ten  of  us.  Marching  second  by  second  as  if  we  were  already  enlisted  prove  to  be  worrisome.  “Stop,  march  backward,  make  it  easy!”  Japtan  was  sweating  in  a  pitiful  way;  he  dare  not  breath  out  loudly  for  fear  of  rejection  on  training  ground.  “Who  is  fit  backstroking?”  our  never  tired,  happily,  jovial  trainer  asked  eagerly.  “We  are  all  fit  for  that!”  our  trainer  looked  dull;  something  is  doubting  his  mind  whether  we  can  deliver.  At  once  we  started,  backstroking  in  pool  of  water  set  for  our  trainings.  “Yes!  yes!”  surprised  trainer  wondering  where  our  skills  comes  from.  I  never  told  him  how  we  have  been  training  every  evening.  “You  can  go  back  to  class!”  ten  of  us  walked  to  class  expectantly. Mr  Donovan  had  shown  his  topic  for  full  viewing, for  understandings.                    
                                                         CRUDE   OIL   THEFT—A   WORST   CRIME
Mr  Donovan  topic  is  a  sensitization  policy,  letting  everyone  in  the  world  to  understand  how  Oil  Theft  can  be  worst  thing  to  do  on  earth.  “Ten  in,  sit  down!”  Mr  Donovan  wanting  to  ask  his  question  from  me,  he  look  focused.  “Em... Can  there  be  an  answer  to  my  question?”  I  licked  my  lips  in  readiness  for  Mr  Donovan’s  question  he  about  to  asked.  “What  is  Oil  Theft?  How  does  it  happened?  Who  suffers  it?  what  is  the  solution?”  Mr  Donovan  four  questions  left  the  whole  hall  in  deep  silence.  We  all  think  before  we  answered.  I  boldly  pull  up,  raising  my  hand  up  for  a  complete  showdown  with  Mr  Donovan’s  enormous  questions.  “Coordinator-five  I  know  you  have  an  answer  to  my  question.  Let  me  hear  how  convincing  your  answers  can  be!”  I  held  my  rosary,  kissed  it  as  it  would  bring  full  confidence  to  me.  “Oil  theft  is  about  stealing  oil  when  it  is  known  or  unknown  that  it  is  wrong  taking  what  does  not  belong  to  you.  Oil  theft  happen  when  the  authorities  least  expect  it  from  happening.  People  that  suffers  it  are  those  who  need  urgent  attention,  thereby,  waiting  for  the  government  to  intervene  so  that  their  needs  would  be  met.  When  the  oil  is  stolen  how  can  the  government  meet  the  dire  needs  of  those  awaiting?  It  is  somehow  impossible.  People  dealing  with  this  acts  of  crude  oil  theft  should  desist  from  it  so  that  there  can  be  a  better  future  for  the  less  privileged  people  in  Africa  and  in  the  world.  The  solution  for  crude  oil  theft  is  nothing  but  sensitizing  the  whole  nations  about  the  dangers  of  crude  oil  theft,  how  it  has  led  many  hopeless  when  the  future  suppose  to  be  bright  for  every  citizens  as  it  is  mandatory.”  Anyone  coming  in  first  would  think  the  hall  we  were  in  is  a  grave.  Complete  silence  spread  across  every  angle  in  the  hall.  Mr  Donovan  refused  saying  whether  I  am  right  or  wrong  rather  he  choose  to  cover  his  face  with  his  palms.  Students  receiving  lectures  wait  to  hear  Mr  Donovan’s  response.  I  know  within  me  I  was  right  but  still  yet;  I  need  a  full  confirmation  from  Mr  Donovan.  “You  are  one  hundred  percent  right!  Your  answers  really  let  me  speechless  for  long,  brilliant  boy  you  are!”  the  whole  hall  became  a  shouting  ground,  students  all  in  number  kept  hailing  me,  they  called  my  name,  my  code  name  I  bear  in  the  academy.  Now  I  am  confident  that  I  made  the  right  choice  about  my  career  boss  never  want  me  to  choose.  “Silent  please,  I  am  still  lecturing!”  calmness  spread  in  hall  after  Mr  Donovan  ordered.       “Crude  oil  theft  is  crime  of  the  year,  crime  of  decades,  crime  of  centuries,  crime  of  the  whole  millenniums!  Many  generations  suffered  immediately  a  pipe-line  is  burst  for  easy  stealing  of  oil.  We  can’t  continue  to  watch  how  it  has  happened;  all  we  are  saying  is  that  this  nefarious  acts  should  be  immediately  stopped  to  avert  problems  ahead!”  huge  calmness  filled  everyone’s  mind.  I  want  more  enlightenment  from  Mr  Donovan.  I  enjoyed  his  topic  in  which  I  never  pray  it  should  end.  “But  sir,  how  do  I  pass  this  information  about  something  I  had  long  think  is  right  doing?”  Japtan  asked  with  curiousness.  “Never  too  late,  tell  people  doing  it  that  they  are  hurting  the  innocents!”  Japtan  held  himself,  screaming  as  if  he  had  once  stolen  something  that  does  not  belong  to  him.  “Japtan  I  understand  what  is  on  your  mind—it  is  absolutely  wrong!”  students  seems  to  exhibit  sober  moods  as  Mr  Donovan  made  it  loud  that,  crude  oil  theft  is  a  serious  crime.  “I  have  one  question  to  ask  sir,  can  there  be  world  free  of  crude  oil  theft?”  “absolutely  yes!”  whoever  thinks  he  can  defeat  Mr  Donovan  with  tough  questions  should  be  fully  prepared,  as  the  lectures  progresses  there  seems  to  be  no  one  bold  enough  to  defeat  Mr  Donovan  in  any  way.  Jotting  sheets  were  full  of  words  anyone  in  hall  had  heard  or  never  heard  of  while  living.     “I  believe  no  questions.  I  should  be  heading  for  another  topic!”  Mr  Donovan  wrote  it  on  board.   
                                                         SEA   PIRACY—AN   INCREDIBLE   CRIME   
“Can  anyone  tell  me  what  is  all  about  sea  piracy?”  again,  I  consider  an  answer  to  Mr  Donovan’s  question  not  minding  how  jealous  students  in  hall  can  be.  Focused  eyes  flashed  on  me;  students  knew  I  have  something  to  say,  so,  they  watched  me  while  murmuring  to  one  another.  As  Mr  Donovan  wait  for  an  answer,  he  make  a  thud  on  the  floor;  his  display  is  as  a  result  of  a  quick  answers  not  coming.  Mr  Donovan  pushed  the  bottled  water  kept  for  him,  tweaked  the  cap,  forced  water  into  his  dried  throat.  He  shook  his  head,  drained  all  water  out  into  his  flapped  throat.  “No  answers  for  sea  piracy..?”  I  pretend  that  question  was  too  much  answering;  students  waiting  to  see  how  I  would  act  since  they  believe  I  have  knowledge  for  all.  “Those  aspiring  to  become  seaman  should  know  this  is  a  question  they  should  have  an  answer  for!”  Impassively  I  stood  up.  “Coordinator-five  again?  Is  he  only  student  here?  where  are  others?  If  they  are  here  are  they  dunce?”  Mr  Donovan  anger  can  be  seen  with  the  way  he  angrily  asked  questions  directed  for  slow  thinking  students  in  hall.  “Sea  piracy  I  would  say  it  is  new  to  me.  Well:  to  me  it  explains  how  desperate  brigands  and  felons  operates  on  seas  for  selfish  motives.”  “Did  you  all  hear  him?” all  students  forced  their  heads  down,  my  answer  brought  big  shame  to  them.  “Paul  Collins,  the  academy  coordinator-five  would  one  day  be  enlisted  as  a  navy  seaman;  but  for  others  looking  dolorously,  I  can’t  speak  for  them.”  Last  college  I  was  recognitions  went  to  me  unexpectedly.  In  Nigeria  navy  academy  not  up  to  three  weeks,  students  had  begin  to  know  how  technical,  brilliant,  sharp  I  was.  “As  coordinator-five  had  given  his  answer,  have  any  of  you  asked  yourself  how  can  sea  piracy  come  to  a  halt?”  delaying  chances  is  an  hindrance  to  any  progress.  “I  will  try,  sir!”  I  made  clear.  “May  God  bless  the  womb  of  the  woman  that  gave  birth  to  you!  How  I  wish  I  am  your  father!”  Mr  Donovan  words  led  me  stammering  as  I  battled  for  clear  answers.  Mother  is  dead,  it  is  past  memory  for  me;  I  wouldn’t  like  anyone  mentioning  anything  relating  to  my  mother;  Mr  Donovan  taking  me  back.  “Paul  Collins,  coordinator-five,  something  is  bothering  you.  Be  courageous  and  show  who  you  are  among  this  slow  thinking  students!”  abusing  my  fellow  students  right  in  my  presence  was  a  big  spat  on  my  face.  I  reluctantly  refused  saying  any  word.  Mr  Donovan  taking  by  surprise,  looked  around  if  someone  is  in,  threatening  me  not  answering.  “Coordinator-five  it  happens  that  way  for  boosting  the  morale  of  slow  thinkers,  cowards  and  dunce.”  “An  idea  sir!”  Japtan  raise  signal  letting  students  to  think  another  genius  is  among  them.  “Sea  piracy  can  end  when  all  seas  are  dried!”  provoking  laughs  students  forced  out  turned  an  interesting  hall  to  looked  like  a  market  place. “Possible  Japtan?”  Mr  Donovan  set  another  stage  for  full  laughs;  he  joined  to  laugh  also.  “This  chap  is  fit  for  comedy  shows.  Oh,  on  sea  he  can  be  needed  too.  Japtan  I  don’t  think  seas  can  dry!”  never  ashamed  Japtan  crossed  over  his  legs  while  confidently  sitting  down.  “Someone  here  should  try  please!”  low  conversations  streaming  out  from  far  end  of  hall  we  were.  “Coordinator-five  stand  up,  you  have  something  to  say,  say  it  now!”  “Um,  sea  piracy  is  not  created  to  exist;  therefore,  it  must  end.  Sensitization  policies  is  needed.  Youths  engaging  themselves  with  hijacking  of  large  vessels,  stealing  passengers  monies,  jewelleries,  should  know  that  it  is  an  illicit  thing  doing  when  God  himself  does  not  place  them  on  that  line.  When  sensitization  policies  goes  on  sea  I  think  sea  piracy  would  end!”  “brilliantly!  An  applause  please!  His  speeches  is  enough  to  end  all  illicit  activities  on  sea.  We  shall  end  this  lectures  till  other  time!”  students  going  to  their  various  rooms  as  tiredness  shows  on  them.  I  got  to  my  room,  opened  the  door,  entering  immediately.                   
“Who  is  there?”  I  screamed  forcing  my  breathe  balanced  due  to  surprised  knock  waking  me  up.  “Information  had  passed  round  that  you  would  joined  them  going  to  sea.  Coordinator-five  that  is  awesome!”  “what  sorts  of  lies,  are  you  trying  to  tell  me  you  heard  that  students  had  been  saying?”  “It  is  true,  believe  it!” taking  us  coldly  was  the  sound  of  bugle  making  way  for  every  students  to  converged  since  an  announcement  is  to  be  passed  for  everyone  to  hear  clearly.         “Japtan  can  it  be  true?”  already,  I  was  smiling  within;  something  I  was  giving  out  is  nothing  but  a  little  fear.  How  would  sea  life  look  like,  what  type  of  environment  it  would  posed  to  be?  Can  it  sink  our  vessel  that  would  carry  us?  I  wrestled  for  an  answer  deep  down  me.  On  reaching  our  training  ground.  Announcement  is  already  going  on  undisturbed  from  Commander  Davies  the  leader  in-charge.  Hubbub  whistling  was  completely  taking  over  his  prolix  speeches  after  long  minutes  of  words.  Academy  students  paying  salutes  to  my  name  in  numbers.  “Can  he  come  out  and  show  us  how  he  is  determined  to  show  he  would  no  longer  be  a  landlubber  anymore!”  the  steel  too  high  stepping  on;  two  guards  pulled  me  up  as  I  courageously  faced  students  wishing  me  safe  on  sea.  “All  signals  is  set,  coordinator-five  this  way!”  a  light  blue  wagon  awaits  me  not  far  from  our  training  ground.  Commander  Davies  with  his  two  guards  directed  me  in;  movement  was  on  course  for  catching  up  with  the  vessel  about  taking  us  to  sea.  Soft  gentle  breeze  cooling  me  in  a  VIP  car.  “This  is  Nigeria  naval  dockyard!”  I  could  feel  the  sea  zephyr  welcoming  us  to  where  I  never  think  of.  “Hurry  up!”  ladder  of  vessel  I  hurdled  into  is  easy  stepping  on  for  any  inexperienced  comers.  Grips  within  me  forming  bigger  when  our  vessel  floats  on  heaping  waters.                                 “Coordinator-five  I  am  proudly  confirming  your  presence  with  us  at  the  sea!”  “O—I  won’t  stop  leering  at  panoramic  colossal  wave,”  I  gave  back  to  a  swaying  steps  stevedore  checking  round  the  wagging  vessel.  Left  side  on  the  vessel  I  stand  really  showing  me  all  I  never  thought  seeing.  Rough  and  unclear  voice  of  disturbing  waves  hammered  out  courage  developing  in  me.  Pellucid  blue  colour  waves  taking  refuge  under  the  Nigeria  Navy  vessel.  Briskly:  Nigeria  flag  dangling  on  a  mast  make  our  sailing  enjoyable. The  flag  facing  me  rectilinear;  I  thought  of  hugging  it  as  a  way  of  salutation  to  my  country—Nigeria.  “Coordinator-five  how  long  can  you  be  standing  to  watch  spreading  waves,  also  the  flag?”  many  thoughts  dwelling  in  me  all  coming  in  one  accord  for  me  swimming.  “Hello.. Paul  Collins,  can  you  hear  me?”  Commander  Davies  forcing  me  to  respond  agog. “Oh:  sea  life  is  interesting,  billows  is  also  scary!”  “now  you  see  what  a  seaman  is  prone to.”  “Free  asking  question?”  “of  course  that  is  why  you  came  here.  Don’t  hesitate  asking  as  many.  Endeavour  for  more!”  “is  this  vessel  capable  sailing  far?”  “Nigeria  Navy  vessel  is  regularly  checked  before  sailing.  Forget  about  the  violent  billows.  This  vessel  can’t  sink  except  when  it  is  steered  to  sink.”  “Sea  is  so  strange!  Smooth  movement  afar  no  hold-up  on  water.”  “Enter  Paul  Collins.  The  crews  had  served  your  food.  Eat,  then  you  can  come  back  watching!”  “sir,  not  now!   This  billows  is  scaring  me!”  “Coordinator-five  obey  as  instructed.  Go,  eat  your  food!”  “yes  sir,  your  wish  I  must  follow!”  I  saluted  Commander  Davies  as  a  subordinate  officer  salutes  a  top  superior  officer.  Vessel  cabin  presents  various  pulchritude  enough  to  catch  anyone’s  attentions.  “Over  here,  it’s  on  table.” I  considered  finishing  in  time  so  as  to  go  back  watching  violent  salient  billows  displaying  its  roles  on  screaming  sea.  “Coordinator-five!”  “at  your  presence!”  the  slender  female  crew  knew  someone  new  had  been  on  board.  “So  it  is  your  choice  to  work  with  Nigeria  Navy  as  seaman?”  “yes.  After  finishing  my  courses  in  the  academy;  I  would  be  enlisted  as  a  naval  seaman.”  “Go  round  watch  for  yourself  rooms  this  vessel  have.  Carefully  touched  anything  you  might  wished  touching.  Coordinator-five  be  careful.”  “Melodies  from  where?—very  good!”                           
Calmed  state  came  upon  me  seeing  bandsmen  bringing  out  melodies  from  triangular  jazz. “Dance  to  our  music!”  with  arms  akimbo  I  dance,  encouraging  photographers  snapping  me.  “Campaigning  against  crude  oil  thefts  would  you  penned  a  music  for  us?”  “Oh, yeah!  How  can  we  make  use  of  the  music  against  crude  oil  thefts?”  “once  is  composed  it  would  be  launched  on  sea.  We  must  continue  singing  sensitization  music  while  the  vessel  is  on  sea!”  “nice  idea!”  “Paul  Collins,  after  your  courses  I  know  you  must  join  us.  We  are  the  Nigeria  navy  bandsmen!”  how  he  came  about  my  name  forced  me  stunned.  The  ambience  room  were  having  patriotic  bandsmen  wearing  naval  uniform;  on  their  heads  were  a  cap  coloured—green,  white,  green.  Composing  music  when  rushed  can  lead  to  mistakes,  I  never  let  the  meritorious  naval  bandsmen  down.  “Yes,  for  over  seven  years  we  have  been  trying  to  composed  such  music.  Paul  Collins  have  our  warm  handshakes.  How  talented  you  are;  the  Nigeria  navy  would  be  proud  having  someone  like  you!”  “he  is  prodigious.”  One  of  the  aghast  bandsmen  said.  “Coordinator-five  join  me  now!”  Commander  Davies  want  me  urgently  outside;  he  disconnect  another  music  I  have  within  to  composed.  “Yes  sir,  I  have  report  myself,  is  there  any  wrong  I  have  done?”  “Coordinator-five  that  is  not  your  line.  Have  you  asked  yourself  what  your  real  mission  is,  here?”  “hmm.. no  sir!”                              “Okay.  Would  you  swim?”  “swim  in  this  killer  waves?”  “Coordinator-five  you  are  up  to  the  task.”                             Rough,  unclear  voices  the  unpredictable  waves  blew  out  panicked  me  as  I  drew  closer  to  Commander  Davies.  “Where  is  he?”  “who  sir?”  “naval  stevedore!”  “Commander  I  am  at  your  service!”  “give  him  a  lifejacket!”  “consider  it  done  sir.”  I  could  feel  how  drier  my  tongue  is.  “What  of  if  I  drowned?”  “it  would  come  as  an  honour  that  the  academy  lose  someone  prepared  to  die  for  his  country!”  that  word—Death,  I  wouldn’t  want  now  that  I  have  not  achieved  anything  in  life.  Commander  Davies  didn’t  even  smiled  when  telling  me  his  mind.  “Here  sir!”  while  he  pant,  the  stevedore  showed  me  how  lifejacket  is  worn  to  prevented  drowning.  “Long  rope!”  Commander  Davies  signalling  for  a  rope.  Too  dangerous  diving  in  waves  ready  to  sink  any  vessel. Not  long  lifejacket  was  on  me  I  abseiled  into  the  sea  adamantly.  The  unpredictable  waves  pulling  me  away,  I  breath  loudly.  Rope  threw  down  for  me  helped  immensely.  Somehow,  I  could  see  myself  being  pulled  up  from  the  desperate  sea.  “Is  inside  there,  interesting?”  “I  couldn’t  see  how  it  looked  like.  Pulling  waves  coupled  with  scary  billows  pinning  me  down.”  “Where  you  able  to  conquer  that  pressure  on  sea?”  “I  had  to  as  I  have  come  for  sea  testing.”  “Coordinator-five  would  it  be  proper  for  me  telling  you?”  “what  sir?” “students  we  had  brought  for  sea  testing  had  always  make  us  stupid.  None  of  them  had  performed  better  when  it  comes  to  sea  testing.  You  did  well  in  your  sea  testing!”  “Happy  for  me  to  hear  this,  sir!” such  sea  testing  that  took  almost  three  minutes  gave  me  passed  mark.  “Other  nine  would  also  make  used  of  lifejacket  in  sea.”  I  stared  at  the  rough  sea;  silently  I  held  my  rosary  praying  for  other  nine  aspiring  students  working  towards  becoming  a  seaman  to  prevailed  in  sea  training  I  underwent.  “Exams  for  all  the  courses  you  had  been  going  through  would  commenced  soonest.  If  you  prevailed  in  all  that  would  make  way  for  your  passing  out  and  direct  enlistment  into  the  Nigeria  navy.”  All  focus  I  had  for  the  sea,  is  about  scary  billows,  to  right  side  is  waves  smashing  against  coastal  cliffs,  and  these  collisions  loosen,  ripping  away  slabs  of  rock.  “I  have  a  call  to  make,  excuse  me!”  so  many  vessels  sailing  faster  as  if  sea  competitions  is  going  on.  “Paul  Collins  someone  identifying  himself  as  a  priest  called.  He  said  audibly  his  name  is  Father  Arinze.  Is  he  your  father  or  guardian?”  “Father  Arinze!  He  promised  visiting  me.”  “Who  really  is  he?”  “my  guardian.”  “But  how  did  he  got  my  number..?”  “he  might  got  it  from  one  of  the  securities  at  main  gate  he  knew  well.”                                                     
“Is  better  for  us  to  go  back  to  the  academy.  Father  Arinze  must  had  waited  for  you  anxiously.”                                  “Sea  life  is  sweet,  how  I  wish  I  come  here  again  next  time.”  “You  shall  after  the  academy,  don’t  worry.”  The  vessel  making  a  U-turn  direct  to  the  Nigeria  naval  dockyard. “Goodbye  scary  billows!  I  shall  come  again  campaigning  against  crude  oil  thefts,  sea  piracy  lurking  around  on  seas!”  “that’s  your  mission,  next  time  here,  coordinator-five.”  Commander  Davies  hurtled  in,  I  also  followed  him  straight  to  where  he  heads  to.  Commander  Davies  in  an  indecision  state  blew  out  air  from  his  mouth.  In  silent  concealed  room  we  were  I  can  see  how  prayerful  Commander  Davies  was.  He  was  praying  for  his  families,  his  students  in  the  academy,  an  end  to  crude  oil  thefts,  piracy  on  African  waters  and  international  waters,  and  for  me  as  well.  Concealed  room  in  cabin  we  were  is  well  furnished  beyond  expectations.  Quick  knock  from  a  male  crew  ended  Commander  Davies  prayers. “We  have  got  back,  coordinator-five!” Commander  Davies  wore  his  specs  as  he  walked  down  with  me  to  meet  his  loyal  guards  already  waiting  tirelessly  for  him.  “Commander  this  way!”  widely  opened  short  doors  were  giving  way  for  us  in.  Sitting  at  back  of  the  wagon  I  smiled.  VIP  treatment  was  given  to  me  laconically. “Coordinator-five  can  other  nine  students  come  out  successfully  in  sea  testing?”  “they  can  since  they  have  zeal  for  their  various  accomplishment.”  “Your  guardian  would  had  been  angry.”  “No.  Father  Arinze  doesn’t  bother  when  he  ought  to.”  “I  will  meet  him  to  know  him  better.” Loud  horns  from  the  wagon  signalling  Commander  Davies,  the  leader  in-charge  of  the  naval  academy  is  around.  Commander  Davies  welcomed  by  the  academy  trainers.  Two  guards  at  back  of  Commander  Davies  split  themselves;  one  escorting  me  to  where  Commander  Davies  is  heading  to.  “Commander  someone  is  raising  signal!”  I  knew  Father  Arinze  is  the  one  trying  to  signalled  he  had  waited  long.  “Where?”  “from  that  direction!”  Commander  Davies  turned  to  his  left,  walking  hurriedly  to  meet  Father  Arinze.    “Hello  Father  I’m  pleased  to  meet  you!”  Father  Arinze  stunned  seeing  Commander  Davies  spreading  his  open  hands  for  warmth  embracement.  “I’m  also  pleased  to  meet  an  officer  of  the  Nigeria  navy.”  Commander  Davies  hugging  Father  Arinze  as  if  they  had  knew  each  other  for  so  long.  “He’s  my  boy!”  “Father,  he  told  me  you  are  his  guardian.” “Yes.  I  was  the  one  who  made  his  decision  to  be  here.  He  insist  with  his  boss  he  want  joining  the  naval  seaman.  I  brought  him  here.”  “Father  thank  God  it  wasn’t  late.  This  boy  of  yours  have  knowledge  for  sea  testing.  Could  you  imagine  Father,  he  was  brave  during  his  sea  testing!”  “I  knew  he  is  brave  from  very  day  I  set  my  eyes  on  him.”  “Paul  Collins  did  your  boss  disapproved  you  here?”  I  have  forget  the  past,  but  when  Commander  Davies  asked  me  something  relating  to  my  past;  I  never  delayed  aright  answering  him.  “Mr  Collins  disapproved  my  choice  for  my  career.  He  promised  me  to  change  all  decisions  I  have  of  becoming  a  seaman  one  day.  He  begged  me  to  handled  his  consortia  if  I  refused  joining  the  navy.”  “Is  never  a  crime  for  once  to  work  with  the  Nigeria  Navy.  Paul  Collins  you  also  shared  same  story  with  our  overall  superior  in  the  Nigeria  navy—Commodore  Charles!”  “So  the  overall  superior  officer  with  Nigeria  navy  also  had  same  story  with  my  boy,  Paul!”  Father  Arinze  wondering  how  a  superior  officer  story  could  relate  to  mine.  “Can  I  speak  with  Paul  alone?”  “Father  it’s  your  wish  speak  alone  with  him!”  Father  Arinze  spoke  into  my  left  ear  after  we  have  walked  further.  “Is  he  pretending  he  is  nice?”  “Yes  Father,  Commander  Davies  is  just  principled  with  his  instructions.”  “Paul  I’m  happy  hearing  this,  take  this  token  it  would  take  you  till  you  finish  your  courses  in  the  academy.  I  should  be  going  now.”  Father  Arinze  went  back  to  say  goodbye  to  Commander  Davies.  I  went  straight  catching  up  with  Commander  Davies.   “Paul  Collins, soonest  nine  others  would  go  on  sea  testing.  Go,  have  yourself  in  your  room.”               
                                                                                CHAPTER   TEN
Commander  Davies  knew  I  was  tired.  Within  a  minute  I  was  in  my  room.  “Our  gentle  academy  coordinator-five  not  right  hour  to  continue  sleeping!”  bravely  I  jumped  up  thinking  our  trainer  in  academy  had  entered.  “So  it  is  you,  Japtan?”  “students  told  me  last  night  they  saw  you  closer  to  a  priest.  I  doubted  them  until  I  came  here  to  witness  if  really  it  was  you;  now  I  believe  this  is  our  academy  coordinator-five.”  “How  did  you  entered?”  “your  room  door  wasn’t  shut.”  “Tell  me  the  truth:  did  you  really  enter  while  the  door  is  open?”  “coordinator-five  believe  me,  I  met  it  open.”  “Japtan  did  that  nosy  inspector  came  here?”  “No.  He  is  discussing  with  Commander  Davies  presently.”  Japtan  waited  in  my  room  till  I  prepared  for  usual  lectures.  “Mr  Donovan  would  want  me  in  his  lectures.”  “Since  he  knew  you  followed  Commander  Davies  along.”  “I  went  for  sea  testing.  I  didn’t  just  followed  Commander  Davies  to  sea!”  “sea  testing  describe  how  it  was.”  “Commander  Davies  would  take  you,  other  eight  for  sea  testing  be  prepared  for  it.  A  lifejacket  would  be  given  to  each  of  you  since  all  of  you  are  a  landlubbers.”  “Have  I  told  you  I  can  swim  perfectly  in  river? besides  I  don’t  need  lifejacket.”  “Japtan  that  is  river  not  sea.  Have  you  seen  billows  before?”  “those  puppets  they  play  around  when  not  invited.  They  will  never  stop  to  crack  jokes  I  hate  them!”  “I  mean  large  sea  waves!”  “Ah,  that  can  take  away  anyone’s  life.  Were  you  able  to  withstand  it?”  whatever  I  present  about  large  sea  waves  Japtan  would  doubt  it,  he  believe  it  is  impossible  surviving  billows.  “It  almost  rushed  me  away,  I  held  on  more  boldly.  That  is  how  I  passed  sea  testing.”  “That  is  sheer  wickedness!  Am  going  back  home.  I  don’t  want  to  become  navy  seaman  anymore!”  as  decided  Japtan  threw  his  jotting  sheets  angrily,  walked  to  begin  packing  his  belongings.  Academy  trainers  were  training  some  students;  from  far  they  had  seen  Japtan  throwing  jotting  sheets  to  the  floor;  familiar  one  among  them  inquired  knowing  what  prompted  Japtan  behaving  silly. “Coordinator-five  come  here!”  I  make  fast  rush  to  answer  him.  “Here  sir!”  “both  of  you  follow  me!”  something  within  tells  me  we  are  heading  for  Commander  Davies  office.  Japtan  looking  relaxed  despite  in  serious  situation  that  had  called  for  attention.  “Coordinator-five  this  is  last  time  we  would  be  seeing  again.” Sad  state  came  upon  me;  I  never  want  Japtan’s  decision  approved  in  Commander  Davies  office.  “You  two  sit  here!”  persuading  Japtan  changing  his  mind  proved  abortive  as  he  defied  becoming  naval  seaman  one  day.  “Coordinator-five,  enter  he  want  to  speak  with  you.”  “Who  actually  sir?” I  hastily  asked.  “Commander  Davies  the  one  you  know!”  “okay  leader  in-charge  of  this  academy.”          As  I  was  entering  Commander  Davies  office,  I  kept  turning  back  to  see  if  Japtan  is  signalling  he  had  changed  his  determined  mind.  “Paul  Collins  sit  down,”  Commander  Davies  instructed  while  calmed.  “Quarrelling  in  Nigeria  navy  academy  is  totally  unacceptable;  as  coordinator-five  I  expect  full  maturity  from  you.”  “But  sir we  were  not  quarrelling!”  “then  what  was  going  on  among  both  of  you?”  “I  asked  him  if  he  had  seen  billows  before,  surprise  it  was  when  I  realized  Japtan  had  mistook  puppets  for  billows.”  “Then  what  happened?”  “Japtan  finally  knew  it  is  large  sea  waves;  he  changed  his  mind  continuing  in  the  academy  when  he  knew  he  would  also  go  for  sea—  testing!”  “what?  Call  him  for  me!”  Japtan  already  pushing  himself  in  when  I  stood  up  about  calling  for  him.  “Sit  left  Paul  Collins;  Japtan  don’t  take  it  too  far,  you  want  becoming  a  seaman,  yes  or  no?”  “yes  sir!”  “compulsory  for  you  going  for  sea  testing.  Billows  would  have  vanished  before  you,  eight  others  would  go  for  sea  testing.”  “Thank  God  billows  would  had  vanished  when  I  and  eight  others  would  be  taking  our  turns!”  at  the  end  Japtan  smiled  out  hopefully.                                             
“No  billows  when  it would  be  my  turn,  coordinator-five!”  “Am  happy  you  would  continue  what  you  start,  Japtan.”  Two  years  in  academy  had  brought  many  understandings  among  students. Evening  personal  trainings  continue  as  we  had  vowed  among  ourselves  we  would  continue  no  matter  any  situation.  We  were  fortunate  not  been  caught  engaging  in  harsh  trainings.  Reports  had  sneaked  into  Commander  Davies  office  that  ten  students  aspiring  to  become  a  seaman  had  been  training  every  evening  without  notion  of  academy  trainers,  naval  authorities,  inspectors,  leader  in-charge.  Commander  Davies  refused  accepting  all  information  about  I  and  other  nine  training.  Japtan  ignorantly  trained  far,  unknowingly  to  him  Commander  Davies  had  sharply  traced  him  that  day  making  him  been  caught  unaware.  That  memorable  day  usual  academy  bugler  was  informed  to  pass  his  information  through  blowing  the  bugle.  Weary  students  wondered  if  all  is  well  with  the  academy.  “Ten  students  had  decided  for  long  that  it  is  mandatory  training  every  evening  despite  how  experienced  trainers  had  put  in  all  their  best  to  make  sure  every  students  become  skilful  in  their  various  fields.”  Students  doubting  Commander  Davies  revelation  he  can’t  prove  beyond.  Deep  inside  me,  something  tells  me  that  familiar  nosy  inspector  had  reached  his  spying  information  to  Commander  Davies.  “Paul  Collins  that  nosy  inspector  had  done  it  again.   He  had  been  eavesdropping  on  whatever  we  discuss  in  trainings.”  “Japtan  leave  him,  he  is  idle.”  “Students  I  don’t  want  to  mention  names;  for  your  safety  do  away  with  that  so  that  your  years  here  should  not  be  a  waste,  ten  of  you!” after  end  of  homily  warning  Commander  Davies  guards  led  him  straight  for  his  office.  We  scattered  to  our  various  rooms—like  sheep  without  no  actual  shepherd.  Three  days  after  Commander  Davies  warning  Japtan,  together  with  eight  others  went  for  sea  testing  as  they  had  been  longing  for  it.  Seventy  days  pass  no  trace  of  them  coming  back  until  the  seventy-fifth  day  they  appeared  all  looking  happy.  “Sea  testing  is  fantastic,  I  saw  how  billows  bowed  for  me  before  getting  into  the  sea!”  “billows  bowed  for  coward  like  you?” I  was  still  in  surprise  with  Japtan’s  revelation.  “Commander  Davies  had  studied  the  sea  than  you  think.  I  recall  when  I  almost  gave  up  he  assured  me  billows  would  had  vanished  before  I  and  eight  others  go  for  sea  testing.”  Snorl  best  friend  to  Japtan  confirmed  it  is  true  of  how  billows  vanished  despite  how  stormy  weather  was  on  sea.  “Japtan  billows  vanished  not  bowing  for  you.”                                       “that’s  what  I  mean,  Paul  Collins!”  “did  you  led  your  campaign?”  “I  don’t  know  which  campaign  you  mean.  I  only  know  nine  of  us  just  back  led  a  campaign  about  ʻThe  Dangers  Of  Crude  Oil  Thefts’  on  seas,  we  also  led  a  campaign  about  ʻDangers  Of  Sea  Piracy’ on  seas,  Paul  Collins  I  won’t  forget  the  last  one.”  “Which  one?”  “No  against  poaching  fishes  in—seas!”  “which  seas  exactly  did  that  campaign  took  place?”  “Atlantic  oceans,  Gulf  of  Guinea,  Kenyan  ocean,  Indian  ocean.”  “That  far?”  “Commander  Davies  want  us  to  see  major  seas  we  may  had  heard  of  that  was  how  we  ended  up  sailing  far. Only  nine  of  us  as  students  coalesce  as  we  loudly beat  drums   thereby  creating  awareness  of  dangerous  activities  not  welcoming  on  any  seas.”  “Very  good  sensitization  programmes.  Did  Commander  Davies  knew  about  it?”  “he  warn  us  to  do  that  if  we  are  enlisted  as  seamen.  We  proved  deaf  ears  when  we  noticed  he  had  slept  on  board.”  “Snorl  did  you  do  yours  better?”  I  knew  Snorl  is  a  shy  type  that  prompted  me  asking  him  what  he  never  expect.  “For  Africans  sake,  I  can  do  more!”  Snorl  is  determined  to  lead  massive  campaigns  on  seas  if  given  the  full  chance  from  the  look  on  his  face.  “Japtan  my  campaign  would  mainly  be  on  Gulf  of  Guinea,  later  anywhere  I  may  be  lucky  going.”  “Our  mission  if  enlisted  may  not  include  campaigning  on  seas.  By  ourselves  we  must  do  that  even  if  we  are  not  on  same  vessel.”   “Of  course!  It  is  all  we  got  to  do  so  as  preventing  seas  from  illicit  activities  coming  up  daily.”                                              
“Students  marching,  look  at  large  banners  they  are  holding.”  Graduating  students  on  their  final  year  were  marching  as  each  saluted  academy  trainers  inspecting  them.  “When  is  our  turn  Japtan  we  must  march  round  the  academy.”  Naval  convoys  moving  into  the  academy  all  having  Nigeria  flags  revolving.  Five  guards  jumped  out  from  one  of  the  convoys  that  stopped  before  other  convoys  also  stopped.  Japtan,  Snorl  and  I  watched  speechlessly  as  an  officer  came  out  from  a  dark  jeep  waving  graduating  students  marching  passionately  on  a  straight  line.  Some  students  jostling  to  have  an  handshake  with  the  unknown  officer.  Guards  pushing  them  away  as  they  were  almost  hugging  him. “This  officer  may  be  Commodore  Charles,  don’t  you  think  so—Japtan?”      “Ha!  If  he  is  that  Commodore  they  are  always  talking  about  then  he  is  liberal.”  “Look  students  are  hugging  him!”  “their  numbers  are  increasing!” from  far  the  white  uniformed  officer  removed  his  specs  distracting  him  from  looking  each  elated  students  face  to  face.  Commander  Davies  clearing  way  for  the  complete  white  uniformed  officer  to  move  undisturbed.  Scenario  of  seven  minutes  turn  more  interesting  with  different  ways,  manners,  desperations  naval  academy  jazzmen  start  exhibiting;  total  silence  reached  within  every  corners  of  the  Nigeria  navy  academy.  Calmed  complete  white  uniformed  officer  stand  unshakable  immediately  the  national  anthem  of  Nigeria  was  sang.  Right  from  where  I  stand;  I  could  see  how  students  were  jubilant  after  the  Nigeria  national  anthem  ended  with  words  I  won’t  easily  forget—ʻOne  nation  bound  in  freedom  Peace and  unity’.  The  Nigeria  pledge  started  when  Nigeria  national  anthem  ended;  tears  falling  down  from  my  face,  I  love,  cherishes,  everything  my  eyes  can  see  in  my  country, Nigeria.  I  remember  how  I  make  a  clear  decision  of  aspiring  to  become  Nigeria  navy  seaman  when  my  boss  had  been  thinking  that  when  I  finish  secondary  schooling  I  would  handle  some  part  of  his  consortia.  “I’ve  concluded  I  must  serve  my  country  Nigeria  till  death!”  “Paul  Collins  you  seems  to  be  carried  away  by  the  Nigeria  national  anthem!”  “of  course  Snorl!  I  am  shedding  tears  of  likeness for  my  country—Nigeria.”  Commander  Davies  lead  the  way  to  show  the  unfamiliar  complete  white  uniformed  officer  new  site  where  arboretum  exist  in  the  academy.  “He  is  perceiving  each  flowers  with  slow intense  enthusiasm.”  “Yes  Paul  Collins, take  a  look  at  him;  he  must  be  a  lover  of  precious  flowers.  He  do  not  even  want  to  move  away  from  the  site.”  “Japtan  he  had  decide  to  bade  the  precious  flowers,  goodbye!”  “Paul  Collins  why  is  he  interested  staring  at  you?”  “who  Japtan?”  “the  unfamiliar  complete  white  uniformed  officer!”  I  begun  feeling  uneasy  when  the  complete  white  uniformed  officer  never  wishes  taking  his  eyes  away  from  me.  Commander  Davies  trying  everything  possible  just  to  distract  his  superior  away  from  me.  “Paul  Collins  tell   me  the  truth.  Do  you  by  chance  know  this  heavily  guarded  man?”  “Japtan  you  should  be  first  person  I  would  tell  if  I  knew  him!”  “coordinator-five,  it  is  against  the  academy  lying.  I  would  want  an  answer  from  you;  do  you  again  knew  this  man?”  “I  do  not  even  know  who  he  is,  where  he  came  from,  if  he  is  citizen  of  Nigeria.”  Commander  Davies  succeeded  in  distracting  the  complete  white  uniformed  officer  when  he  pointed  to  the  azure  sky.  “He  is  looking  curiously  at  revolving  azure  sky.”  “Coordinator-five  blue  sky,  same  colour  with  junior  ranked  navy.”  “I  trust  Commander  Davies,  he  would  not  even  try  stopping  the  unfamiliar  officer  from  more  watch,  all  this  are  tactic  he  is  using  so  that  his  heavily  guarded  superior  would  not  continue  staring  at  me.”  “Don’t  tell  me  you  like  the  way  he  was  staring  at  you.”  “I  like  his  passionate  feelings  towards  me;  but  I  don’t  like  his  continuous  looking.”  Commander  Davies  signalled  academy  bugler  who  responded  by  blowing  the  bugle  with  full  interest  to  continue  without  obstruction  from  anyone  whosoever.  Commander  Davies  superior  paying  visit  to  the  academy  waved  away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
“Paul  Collins  he  had  gone;  how  do  you  feel  about  that  man?”  “Snorl  that  white  uniformed  officer  may  had  seen  me  somewhere  judging  by  the  way  he  kept  staring  eagerly  at  me  with  passion.”  Students  in  each  corners  of  the  academy  were  having  discussions  which  I  believe  is  all  about  visit  of  a  superior  officer  higher  than  the  position  of  the  leader  in-charge—Commander  Davies.  Exhausted  jazzmen  arose  after  resting  for  some  time,  began  again  performing  their  duty  when  someone  of  an  importance  finish  visiting  the  academy.  “Paul  Collins  let’s  conduct  a  full  investigation  to  ascertain  who  than  man  is!”  “yes  I  support  you  Snorl!”  Japtan  said  with  full  gladness  on  his  face.  Three  of  us  went  straight  to  meet  some  students  chatting  with  one  another.  We  asked  what  we  want  and  an  answer  came  to  us  without  any  delay  from  either  side.  I  now  know  it  is  Commodore  Charles  from  Nigeria  naval  command.  “Why  didn’t  he  meet  you  since  you  are  coordinator-five  of  this  academy?”  a  curious  student  asked.  “I  can’t  explain  that;  it  should  be  prime  responsibility  of  Commander  Davies  to  do  that.”  “Is  there  a  problem  between  you  and  Commander  Davies?”  “Nigeria  naval  academy  is  the  most  disciplined  academy  on  earth.  I  don’t  concur  there  can  be  problem  in  this  academy.  Commander  Davies  is  modest  in  all  his  ways.  He  can’t  have  issues  with  his  students;  therefore  he  had  no  problem  with  me,  I  have  no  problem  with  him,  period!”  “save  another  word  from  that  your  running  mouth,  you  are  determined  knowing  more  from  our  academy  coordinator-five.  I  would  not  allow  that  again!” angry  Japtan  responded.  “Coordinator-five  I  salute  you  as  someone  recognised  in  this  academy.”  The  curious  student  about  offending  me  finally  gave  out.  “Coordinator-five  someone  is  calling  you.  From  this  angle!”  Commander  Davies  have  asked  for  me  with  immediate  effect.  Academy  inspector  hasty  for  me  to  follow  him  to  meet  with  Commander  Davies,  leader  in-charge  of  the  academy.  “Commander  Davies  needs  me  until  I  come  we  would  discuss  as  friends.”  “Now  I  see  there  is  an  hidden  agenda  against  Commander  Davies,  tell  me  all  you  have  against  him.  Or  I  will  persuade  Commander  Davies  to  expel  all  of  you!”  “inspector  this  is  not  fair,  we  have  nothing  of  such  against  Commander  Davies.”  “Are  you  sure?”  “I  am  sure  inspector!”  “if  it  is  true  so  be  it,  coordinator-five.”  To  meet  up  with  time;  I  make  myself  faster  as  I  get  into  Commander  Davies  office.  “Coordinator-five  a  top  naval  officer  was  in  this  academy.  Where  you  able  to  figure  out  who  he  is?” “quite  difficult  to  know  who  this  top  naval  officer  is,  but  I  still  conduct  partial  investigation  about  this  top  naval  officer.”  “Then  what  was  your  findings?”  “surprisingly  it  is  Commodore  Charles  I  had  been  hearing  about.”  “Coordinator-five  you  grabbed  his  attention;  I  seems  baffled  with  that  way  he  stares  at  you.  Do  you  both  have  something  in  common?—  Secretly  tell  me  I  want  to  know.”  “Nothing  in  common  sir!”  “I  must  get  to  the  root  of  this  matter.  Commodore  Charles  wasn’t  happy  till  he  left  all  because  of  you!”  “sir  did  he  asked  about  me?”  “Commodore  Charles  asked  to  know  who  you  are;  I  explained  to  him  you  are  coordinator-five  I  briefed  him  about.  He  was  about  speaking  confidentially  with  you;  within  minute  he  changed  his  decision.  Commodore  Charles  said  he  is  short  of  time.  He  lay  out  his  words  that  when  you  are  enlisted  as  Nigeria  navy  seaman  you  would  have  his  privilege  to  see  him  based  on  hardworking,  patriotism,  perseverance,  dedication,  full  zeal,  selfless—services  to  Nigeria  navy.”  Commander  Davies  announced  that  reason  for  Commodore  Charles  coming  is  for  him  to  see  graduating  students  about  to  be  enlisted  soonest.  I  couldn’t  hold  back  my  joy  when  I  was  told  our  set  is  next  to  be  on  line  for  enlistment.  “Coordinator-five  only  ten  would  follow  me  to  Nigeria  navy  dockyard  to  sail  two  days  on  ocean  to  beat  the  drum  against  illicit  activities  on  seas.  We  must  also  campaign  against  crude  oil  thefts, fish  poaching,  sea  piracy,  sea  murders!”            
When  I  got  to  my  room,  I  couldn’t  sleep  smoothly.  I  got  up  from  bed,  informing  nine  others  that  they  should  get  themselves  prepared  when  called  upon  by  Commander  Davies.  Never  of  a  stress  to  me  since  I  have  made  that  decision  of  serving  my  own  country—Nigeria.  One  thing  is  sure;  the  academy  bugler  would  expressed  his  signals  through  the  bugle.  Readily  for  me  I  am  determined  carrying  out  all  academy  assignment  I  can.  “Paul  Collins  can  you  hear?”  time  has  come  for  departure;  Japtan  had  signalled  me  with  heavy  bang  on  the  door. “The  academy  bugler  had  already  signalled.”  Running  hesitantly  is  all  I  got  just  to  avert  Commander  Davies  full  wrath  against  me  in  particular.  As  arranged  by  academy  authorities.  We  were  in  a  bus  taking  us  direct  to  Nigeria  navy  dockyard.  Not  up  to  15km  drive  I  could  see  again  the  well  organised  dockyard.  “Rush  down,  climb  the  vessel  facing  all  of  you  now!”  Commander  Davies  instructed  harshly  in  complete  desperation.  Not  long  we  were  on  board  Commander  Davies  joined  after  then,  the  vessel  sailed  farer.  “Stevedores  bring  all  drums  here!”  as  commanded  they  ran  bringing  what  we  need.  Two  drums  given  to  me  gave  me  courage  starting  my  campaign.  As  Coordinator-five  I  was  left  alone  to  do  three  students  job.  I  would  never  let  my  country  Nigeria  down  for  whatsoever  reason  as  I  have  concluded  within  me.  On  left  side  of  Nigeria  Naval  vessel  TS,  I  beat  my  drum  harder  creating  a  signal  to  heavy  vessels  passing;  all  signals  I  gave  out  was  against  crude  oil  thefts,  my  microphone  given  to  me  as  coordinator-five  helped  a lot.  I  saw  tens  of  thousands  of  hands  waving  me  without  me  seeing  their  heads.  All  supports  this  hands  have  with  me  is  to  agree  that  Crude  oil  thefts  is  bad.  Commander  Davies  had  been  monitoring  me  and  others;  he  is  happy  seeing  all  he  wants  to  see.  As  coordinator-five  I  can  stop  when  I  like.  About  becoming  tired  I  continue  louder  this  time  by  campaigning  against  sea  piracy  on  African  seas.  Next  is  Fish  poaching,  I  instructed  one  of  the  stevedores  to  bring  me  a  fish,  he  brought  live  fish  for  me.  I  held  it  up  while  singing  against  fish  poaching  on  seas.  Fishermen  on  boats  waved  in  support  of  me.  Commander  Davies  shook  his  head,  supporting  me  more  eagerly.  “Such  a  sonorous  voice  I  won’t  stopped  hearing.  Paul  Collins  I’m  glad!  See  how  thousands  hands  had  signalled  supports  for  you.  I  would  inform  Commodore  Charles  about  this.  This  campaign  was  meant  for  Nigeria  navy  seamen;  but  I  allowed  ten  of  you  to  show  how  capable  students  in  Nigeria  navy  academy  can  be.”  Billows  taking  over  quiet  sea  scared  me.  Commander  Davies  showing  his  adamant  skills  by  pushing  each  of  us  back  as  he  was  more  experienced  than  all  of  us. “Continue  never  back  down  Paul  Collins!”  as  horrifying  it  was,  massive  billows  splashed  on  us  allowing  everyone  to  slide  while  we  gasped   for  breathe.  “Students  fight  for  your  life!”  Commander  Davies  warned.  “Show  more  courage,  don’t  relent!”  billow  taking  complete  direction  of  the  moving  vessel  we  were.  Nigeria  flag  revolving  faster  as  we  were  still  battling  to  stand.  “This  is  one  dangerous  thing  we  navies  face  on  sea!  It  can’t  deterred  me  from  serving  my  country  Nigeria.  I  launched  into  silent  prayer  while  holding  my  rosary  worn  on  my  neck.  “It  has  stopped!  Stand  up  boys,  I  love  your  courage  you  boys  showed.”  If  told  this  is  part  of  navies  harsh  encounter  on  sea  I  would  for  once  not  believe  until  it  became  reality  to  me.  “Come  in  boys.  Stevedores  take  them  to  warm  room  before  they  developed  hypothermia!”  “Commander  four  medics  are  in  to  assess  their  various  health  conditions,”  most  youngest  stevedore  announced.  “Oh,  I  was  too  anxious  forgetting  that  medics  are  already  on  standby.”  Ten  of  us  shaking  in  pitiable  way  due  to  billow that  splashed  on  us  from  the  sea.  “Bring  them  in!”  smart  look,  pointed  nose  doctor  voiced.  I  kept  staring  at  his  opaque  eyeglass  glued  to  his  bumpy  face.  Room  rife with  heat  was  where  we  take  shelter.  “Coordinator-five  is  it  okay  with  you?” Commander  Davies  asked  me  courageously.                                          
“I’m  feeling  cold  sir!”  “doctor  stretch  them  on  bed.  Each  of  them  should  relax  a  bit;  make  them  more  comfortable.” On  bed  blue  day  turned  night  after  a  short  sleep. “How  are  you  feeling  now,  coordinator-five?”  “doctor  I’m  becoming  okay.  But  who  told  you  I’m  coordinator-five?”  pointed  nose  doctor  attending  to  me  refused  answering  me.  Japtan  had  sat  on  a  chair  reading  blankly.          “Paul  Collins  how  glad  I’m  to  see  you  in  perfect  state.”  Dedicated  medics  checking  Snorl  panting  state.  The  sea  during  night  is  interesting  watching;  I  raise  an  alert  I  am  becoming  hot,  so  the  medics  approved  sternly  I  should  feel  cool  breeze  outside  the  room  I  and  others  were.  Rough  unclear  voice  of  the  sea  never  deterred  me  watching  racing  billows.  Stroboscope  from  large  vessels  passing  stopped  billows  from  racing.  I  felt  it  is  right  continuing  my  campaigns  on  sea.       I  rushed  in  lifted  my  campaigning  drum  lying  freely  on  board  start  raising  full  awareness  by  beating  hard  the  drum.  “No  to  crude  oil  thefts,  no  to  fish  poaching  on  seas,  no  to  sea  piracy,  no  to  sea  murders,  no  to  illicit  activities  on  seas!”  for  five  hours  I  kept  spreading  awareness  audibly.  Campaigning  about  crude  oil  thefts  is  my  area  of  interest  since  when  Mr  Donovan  sensitized  us  about  the  ʻDangers  of  crude  oil  thefts’.  To  my  surprise  nine  students  were  by  my  side  clearing  their  throats  before  continuing  their  campaigns.  “You  boys  should  go  in  and  sleep;  is  already  too  dark!”  Commander  Davies  expressing  his  dissatisfaction  all  for  his  concern  towards  scary  billows.  “I  said  go  in!”  we  pretend  it  is  right  going  in  just  in  case  another  scary  billows  race  after  our  vessel.  From  the  bulkhead  I  see  Commander  Davies  waving  the  sea  before  heading  to  his  room.  “Want  more  campaigns  boys?”  eagerly  I  begged  for  an  answer.  “Paul  Collins  of  course!”  Japtan  responded  on  behalf  of  eight  others.  Nine  of  my  course  mates  waited  for  me  following  them  outside  for  another  round  of  prolific  campaigns.  “Our  drum  coordinator-five,  Commander  Davies  may  had  carried  it  to  his  room.”  “Snorl  that’s  too  minor  for  smart,  hardworking,  Commander  Davies  doing.”  Japtan  stretching  himself  for  drum  beating.  “Now  let’s  go  on  time,”  I  instructed.  On  reaching  outside  frozen  cold  had  taking  over  atmosphere  of  the  entire  sea.  “Coordinator-five  this  cold  wouldn’t  allow  us  doing  what  we  had  decided.”  Unclear  atmosphere  taking  over  by  cold  seems  denying  our  confidence;  I  search  about  for  our  drums  every  corners  I  can.  Commander  Davies  been  a  smart,  clever  man  knew  ten  of  us  would  had  decide  coming  outside  to  loud  our  voices  on  sea.  He  had  ordered  for  our  drum  to  be  hidden  somewhere  unknown  to  us.  “What  is  our  next  move,  now,  coordinator-five?”  Japtan  asked  while  shivering  in  cold.  “Can  I  sing  my  music  I  composed  on  sea  about—total  no  to  Crude  Oil  thefts?”  “endeavour  to  do  that  coordinator-five.”  Expectant  eyes  focused  on  me  in  a  desperate  way;  I  sang  music  I  composed  in  presence  of  bandsmen  I  met  on  my  first  time  on  sea.  “You  deserved  my  applaud  Paul  Collins!”  Japtan  continue  applauding  me  despite  being  cautioned  to  stop  for  a  while.  “Our  academy  coordinator-five  had  not  for  once  failed  delivering.”  Rehearsals  were  going  on  among  nine  of  my  dedicated  course  mates  as  I  watched  how  interesting  their  rehearsals  can  be.  The  sea  utter  a  howl  in  thick  hour  of  the  cold  night.  “Blanket  would  prevent  us  from  killing  cold.”  “Coordinator-five  do  all  you  can  to  stop  us  from  getting  frozen.”  I  recall  seeing  two  thick  blankets  in  a  free  room  when  the  medics  were  assessing  my  temperature.  I  crawled  watchfully  so  that  I  wouldn’t  be  caught  sneaking  to  get  what  I  desired  for.  “Yes  I  have  it!”  my  course  mates  jubilantly  lifted  me  up  as  they  couldn’t  hold  their  series  of  full  happiness.  “Cover  us  our  coordinator-five.”  Discussing  after  rehearsals  ended  wouldn’t  had  ended  if  not  for  the  stevedores  checking  every  inch  on  board  to  be  sure  that  everyone  is  free  from  dangers,  and  that  the  vessel  is  not  having  strange  people.  “Are  they  coming?”  “I  don’t  think  so,  Japtan.”  “Thank  you  God!”                                                                                          
                                                                         CHAPTER   ELEVEN     
Japtan  show  his  thanks  to  his  heavenly  father  all  because  we  were  not  caught  converging  outside  when  warned  to  go  for  sleep.  “That  Nigeria  navy  sailor  steering  our  vessel  had  not  complain  he  is  tired.”  “Japtan  that  shows  how  patriotic  he  is  to  serve  his  country  without  duress  from  any  side.”  “I  must  do  better  than  him.”  “Like  how  Japtan?”  “doing  more  than  steering  a  vessel.”  Ten  of  us  in  blankets  singing  any  songs  we  know  so  as  preventing  ourselves  from  sleep.  “Paul  Collins  is  there  more  happiness  after  that  day?”  “Japtan  which  day  exactly  are  you  referring  to?”  “graduating  day  and  enlistment  day!”  “for  me  there  would  be  more  days  better  than  that  day;  seeing  my  father  with  my  clear  eyes  should  come  as  best  day, best  hour,  best  time  I  longed  for.”  Thinking  about  past  memories  led  me  speechless  despite  been  talked  to.   “Paul  Collins  is  your  father  lost?” Snorl  asked  in grieve.  “He  travelled  to  Somalia  to  get  a  better  job;  he  believes  there  is  job  he  longed  for  waiting  for  him  there.”  “That  so  far  all  because  of  job?”  “yes  Snorl!”  eight  of  my  course  mates  had  surrendered  to  sleep  while  still  inside  blankets.     “Paul  Collins  did  you  really  choose  becoming  a  seaman?”  “Snorl  my  father  encouraged  my  mother  for  me  becoming  a  seaman.”  Nigeria  Naval  vessel  TS  continue  sailing  undisturbed  by  any  malign.  “Gulf  of  Guinea  is  key  to  Africans:  Paul  Collins  would  you  give  your  best  if  given  that  precious  opportunity  to  campaign  against  illicit  activities  lurking  on  gulf  of  guinea?”  “all  best  within  my  reach  I  will  give,  Snorl.”  In  moody  way  Snorl  gave  himself  up  to  sleep.  Long  minutes  break  after  an  inquiry  discussions  between  I  and  Snorl  was  not  noticed  among  sleeping  course  mates  of  mine.  Mid-morning  had  exposed  out  gradually  becoming  clear  sky.  Where  we  squatted  I  fully  heard  numbering  snoring  from  all  my  course  mates  sleeping  in  desperation.  On  board  I  heard  someone  launch  into  prayers  towards  Nigeria  as  a  nation,  the  person  was  also  praying  for  Africa  to  be  free  from  lingering  illicit sea  activities,  another  thing  baffling  me  is  that  the  voice  also  called  names  of  African  leaders  and  pray  for  their  sound  health  to  continue  no  matter  their  age.  Another  voice  added  to  the  prayers  this  time  that  voice  only  prayed  for  peace  in  Africa,  peace  around  the  world;  peace  among  enemy  nations.  Voices  numbering  in  tens  sprung  up  from  somewhere  on  board  I  may  not  know  of.  “Paul  Collins,  where  are  you!  I  want  to  see  you,  come  out!”  Commander  Davies   yelled  to  have  me  appear  in  his  presence.  “Am  here  sir,  am  here  sir!”  Commander  Davies  raise  an  alarm  making  medics  to  come  to  my  aid.  Ten  of  us  partially  weak  due  to  harsh  cold  on  sea  were  lifted  with  a  stretcher  to  a  warm  room  breezing  out  heat.  “Who  am  I,  where  am  I?”  Snorl  asked  in  fear  after  woken  up  from  odyssey  sleep.  He  noticed  he  is  in  room  welcoming  everyone  with  heat.  “Snorl  that  cold  out  there  is  much;  let’s  give  thanks  to  God  the  supreme  who  make  Commander  Davies  to  know  I  wasn’t  in.”  “Tell  me  exactly  how  that  cold  is  like,  Paul  Collins.”  “It  is  killing!  I  can’t  even  stand  up.  I  regained  half  consciousness  during  minutes  of  prayers.”  Eight  other  course  mates  of  mine  open  their  mouth  wider,  thus  allowing  saliva  to  flow  out  rampantly.  “Close  your  mouth  eight  of  you.  You  are  all  fortunate.”  Medics  treated  us  like  a  way  mothers  pet  their  babies  that  needed  motherly  care,  love,  likeness.                                   “Coordinator  five  is  it  really  true  what  I  just  heard?”  I  know  Commander  Davies  had  broke  the  news  of  how  we  disobeyed  him  by  sneaking  out  to  continue  our  campaigns  against  illicit      activities  going  on  seas.   “Doctor  what  did  you  heard?”  “coordinator-five  you  know  what  I  mean.  Don’t  prove  too  smart!”  “I  with  others  had  done  something  not  wrong  to  us.  You  know  doctor  we  would  become  seaman  one  day.  All  we  did  is  campaigning  against  crude  oil  thefts  on  seas.”                      
Pointed  nose  doctor  grunted  in  passionate  feelings.  “Death  is  inevitable  you  all  almost  die  an  horrifying—death.”  I  kissed  my  rosary  to  me  it  works  like  a  guard  against  horrifying  death.   “Coordinator-five  when  on  sea  be  careful.”  “Doctor  is  there  anything  you  can  do  as  citizen  of  Nigeria  off  your  duty?” pointed  nose  doctor  paused  within  minute  before  answering  me  in  midst  of  his  fellow  colleagues.  “I  hate  illegal  oil  bunkering  in  any  way!  It  is  against  our  ethics  to  go  as  far  by  campaigning  against  illegal  oil  bunkering;  I  could  have  done  that.”  “Yeah  doctor  you  said  the  right  thing;  but  can  you  die  for  your  country?”  “I  have  said  it  all  time  I  can  die  for—my  country  Nigeria!”  I  thought  I  am  the  only  one  that  is  ready  to  die  for  his  country;  now  I  see  another  person  more  ready  than  me  to  die  for  his  country.  “Doctor  do  it  now!”  “well  I  shall  do  that  along  with  my  dedicated  colleagues  whenever  we  treat  any  patient  in  hospitals.”  “Doctor  I  could  have  accompany  you  wherever  you  together  with  your  colleagues  are  heading  to.  I  want  more  campaigns  on  ground.  I  want  campaigns  against  pipeline  vandalisms.”  Commander  Davies  opened  the  door  while  coming  in  to  see  how  we  have  responded  to  treatment.  “Doctor  Chris  are  they  responding  well?”  “Commander  we  are  not  treating  them.”  “Why  Doctor  Chris?”  “they  seems  okay!”  “now  listen  boys.  You  all  almost  cost  me  my  job.  Supposing  Commodore  Charles  heard  what  happened  that  would  be  the  end  of  my  career  as  a  commander  with  the  Nigeria  navy!  Promise  you  won’t  do  so!”  we  were  speechless  all  my  course  mates  wait  hearing  my  response  before  they  utter  any  word.  “I  believe  none  among  you  is  deaf.  I  need  only  one  promise.”  “Sir  Nigeria  is  our  father  land,  we  were  born  and  brought  up  in  this  blessed  nation.  Promoting  Nigeria’s  growth  is  our  heritage.  If  we  are  doing  something  not  against  the  law  of  our  country,  are  we  right?”  Commander  Davies  bent  his  head  low  while  thinking  for  an  answer.    “You  are  right only  if not  against  the  law.”  “Sir  we  did  nothing  wrong!”  “Paul  Collins  I  am  not  saying  you  all  are  fully  wrong.  All  I  laid  out  is  that  you  all  disobeyed  me  by  sneaking  back  outside  when  it  is  clear  to  us  that  scary  billows  can  be  threat  to  us.”  Doctor  Chris  took  two  medical  books  on  green  large  shelf  beside  me.  “Coordinator-five  I  would  do  it  from  now  on,  you  understand.”  Commander  Davies  couldn’t  understand  Doctor  Chris  motive.  Right  in  our  presence  Doctor  Chris  left  while  leaving  his  colleagues  of  medical  line  attending  to  us.  “Paul  Collins  give  me  an  assurance  that  all  is  well.”  “All  is  well  sir!  Only  that  Doctor  Chris  expressed  his  open  mind  that  he  totally  reject  illegal  oil  bunkering.”  Commander  Davies  shook  his  head  in  long  amazement.  “Commander  there  is  a  caller  on  line!  That  caller  only  said  he  wants  to  speak  with  you.”  Glad  for  me  seeing  Commander  Davies  rushing  to  have  words  with  his  unknown  caller.        “I  shall  be  back  any  moment!”  rushing  Commander  Davies  said.  “Japtan  I  would  never  regret  all  I  had  done  on  sea,  how  would  you  respond  to  it?”  “coordinator-five  I  support  all  you  said  with  zeal.”  I  whistled  to  the  air  not  long  music  I  composed  start  taking  over  the  warm  room  we  where.  Bandsmen  of  Nigeria  navy  quickly  located  our  room  and  they  also  joined  us  with  their  skills  of  bringing  out  different  beats  from  their  bands.  “Coordinator-five  finish  your  courses  and  join  us  as  bandsmen.  Someone  with  mellow  voice  needs  to  sing  alongside  us  while  we  produce  live  beats.”  My  mother  had  never  said  my  father  want  me  becoming  bandsman;  I  dipped  my  hands  into  my  pockets  thinking  how  I  would  convinced  the  Nigeria  navy  bandsmen  I  only  want  to  be  addressed  as  Nigeria  navy  seaman.  “Would  you  divert  from  your  profession  all  for  the  reason  of  you  joining  another  profession?”  “to  me  that  is  totally  unacceptable.”  Leader  of  Nigeria  navy  bandsmen  presented.  “Leader  you  have  said  it.  I  can’t  divert  all  for  me  being  pressured  to  join  another  profession.”  Medics  in  our  warm  room  quietly  left  us  all  grinning.                                                                                                                                   Leader  of  Nigeria  navy  bandsmen  shook  hands  with  ten  of  us  as  he  promised  coming  again  only  when  invited  by  me.  “Leader  would  you  and  your  group  come  any  minute  your  assistance  is  needed?”  “coordinator-five  we  are  still  in  this  vessel;  opposite  you  is  our  room  we  had  been  practicing.” The  bandsmen  dashed  out  in  warm  room  where  we  had  been  taking  refuge.  “Paul  Collins  don’t  you  think  is  reasonably  joining  those  bandsmen?”  “Nigeria  navy  is  more  organised  than  any  navy  in  the  world.  If  known  as  seaman  then  it  is  obliged  of  you  continuing  as  seaman  you  are  known  as.”  Japtan  stammers  for  another  word  to  say  but  he  find  it  difficult  presenting  his  mind.  “Japtan  your  mind  is  confused  relax  a  bit  then  you  might  be  able  to  ask  something  of  an  importance  to  you.”  Ajar  door  shows  someone  had  been  eavesdropping  on  our  conversations.                                 Commander  Davies  pushed  the  door  widely  open;  called  me  in  inquisitive  mood.  “Mr  Collins  asked  of  you!  Is  he  that  boss  you  had  discussed  about?”  “yes  sir.  He  had  seen  me  long  ago;  maybe  he  had  been  waiting  for  me  in  the  academy.”  “Paul  Collins  of  course  he  is  waiting  for  you  in  academy.”  It  wasn’t  palatable  for  me  hearing  Mr  Collins  was  waiting  for  me  since  I  believe  he  won’t  wish  me  well  in  academy.  “Sir  can  I  speak  with  him  on  phone?”  “he  hung  up  when  he  realised  I  am  not  giving  him  permission  to  speak  with  you.”  “But  it  is  fair  granting  him  permission  to  speak  with  me.”  “Paul  Collins  we  don’t  permit  family  affair  when  on  an  official  duty!”  “Commander  he  is  on  line  again!” Commander  Davies  walked  straight  to  answer  Mr  Collins.  “Paul  Collins  smile,  don’t  panic!”  Snorl  encouraged.  “He  never  wants  me  becoming  a  seaman;  definitely  he  is  not  wishing  me  well  in  the  academy.”  “Paul  Collins  think  positive;  I  believe  something  good  awaits  you  from  him.”  Japtan  now  looking  like  a  prophet  with  his  words  of  assurance  towards  me.  “Someone  who  almost  end  my  life  with  his  dark  shotgun.  How  can  he  wish  me  well?”  I  asked.  “He  can  if  having  change  of  heart.”  Mr  Collins  overtook  my  mind  as  I  think  about  his  wife,  David,  Georgina.  “I  almost  forgot  them  if  not  that  boss  asked  of  me  his  dedicated  forgotten  boy.”  “Who  did  you?”  “my  boss  wife,  his  dry-cleaner,  my  friend—David.”  “So  they  also  hurt  you?”  “no.”  Conflicting  issues  begun  streaming  my  mind;  Mr  Collins  might  had  decided  paying  visit  to  me  just  for  mocking  me.  Father  Arinze  should  have  been  informed  before  Mr  Collins  would  planned  coming  far.  “I  would  prefer  he  see  me  after  finishing  in  academy.”  “As  for  me  my  parents  would  check  me  on  graduating  day.  They  would  like  one  of  their  own  enlisted  as  seaman  with  Nigeria  navy.  I  can’t  wait  more  on  that.”  Standing  clock  facing  us  struck  thus  making  us  getting  prepare  for  any  work  on board  Commander  Davies  might  wants  us  doing.  “Yes  am  back,  Mr  Collins  kept  pestering  me.  He  knows  it’s  impossible  for  you  getting  back  to  academy  in  two  minutes.”  “Two  minutes?  Did  he  want  me  flying?”  “I  still  not  understand  reason  of  him  calling  for  you  in  two  minutes.”  “Loud  sound  sir!”  Commander  Davies  rushed  going  out  just  for  him  seeing  whatever  makes  that  loud  sound.  We  followed  him  hurriedly.  “Poachers  shooting  that  shark!”  not  long  after  dramatic  scenario  I  ordered  nine  of  my  course  mates  to  bring  our  drums  for  campaigning  against  shark  poaching.  “Commander  this  is  Gulf  of  Guinea!”  “Bring  me  my  telescope!” most  youngest  stevedore  ran  bringing  Commander  Davies  his  telescope.  “So  many!  Many  poachers!”  we  beat  harder  our  drums  to  show  our  displeasure  for  poachers  on  seas.  “Beat  the  drum  harder,  coordinator-five!”  noises  from  our  drums  led  the  poachers  running  for  their  life.  “Not  one  is  seen!”  Jubilations  from  us  continue  as  we  had  won  a  big  war  against  desperate,  avarice ,  mean  poachers  lurking  around  on  seas.  “Two  days  has  passed  on  ocean  now  I  think  it  is  suitable  for  the  sailor  going  back.”  Commander  Davies  informed  the  patriotic  sailor.                                    “Paul  Collins  this  sailor  took  us  as  far  by  coming  to  Gulf  of  Guinea.”  “I  am  surprised  as  well.”
“All  of  you  follow  me!”  Commander  Davies  directing  our  steps  focusing  towards  where  the  dedicated,  hardworking  sailor  is  steering  the  vessel.  “Just  watch  how  he  steers  this  vessel;  learn  his  skills  very  well.”  Focused  sailor  saluted  Commander  Davies  in  full  courage.  Steering  a  vessel  required  more  energy  when  on  sea.  My  eyes  became  exhausted  as  Commander  Davies  warned   us  to  be  focused.  “Commander  already  at  dockyard!”  coming  nearer  I  could  see  navies  on  an  abandoned  vessel  swinging  Nigeria  flag  to  welcome  us  back  to  Nigeria  navy  dockyard.  “Hope  you  all  learnt  something  of  an  immense  benefit?”  “yes  sir!”  we  all  expressed  ourselves  in  a  way  Commander  Davies  expect  us  to.  “Commander  Davies  ordered  the  stevedores  to  bring  us  down  carefully.  While  on  land,  Nigeria  navy  wagon  moving  towards  us  stopped  making  all  of  us  believing  the  driver  of  the  wagon  is  fully  ready  taking  us  back  to  academy.  “Commander,”  said  the  driver,  “Commodore  Charles  had  instruct  me  here.  Nigeria  navy  helicopter  should  be  on  its  way  here  lifting  everyone  back  to  academy.”  To  clear  every  doubts  inside  me  an  helicopter  whirl  towards  us,  landed  on  vast  ground.  “Commander  come  quickly!”  short  sleeve  pilot  from  Nigeria  navy  helicopter  signals.  Running  to  have  ourselves  in  was  all  we  make  for.  Green-white-green  Nigeria  navy  helicopter  that  was  sent  for  us  took  us  back  to  academy.  We  were  on  academy  training  ground  within  twenty  minutes.  Boss  had  seen  me  from  distance;  he  sat  for  me  coming  to  meet  him.  Commander  Davies  didn’t  noticed  he  was  there.  “Paul  Collins  I  shall  inform  him  there  is  training  during  night.”  “Who  exactly  sir?” “the  bugler.”  “Okay  I  would  inform  others  around  there  is  training  during  night  time.”  Commander  Davies  make  haste  straight  to  his  office.  I  took  fifty  steps  in  meeting  Mr  Collins.  “Poor  boy  that  wish  remaining  poor  for  the  rest  of  his  life!”  greeting  Mr  Collins  wasn’t  a  surprise  to  him  as  he  knew  me  with  such  an  habit.  “Paul  door  is  still  open  for  you.  Would  you  leave  this  place  and  follow  me?”  “sir  I’m  fully  okay  here!”  “Paul  I  thought  what  came  upon  you  would  have  left  you.  This  place  is  all  about  restless  trainings.  My  consortia  doesn’t  required  you  making  any  trainings  of  such.  Imagine  you  being  called  semi-boss.  That  is  all  I  want  for  you  my  boy.”  “Sir  I’m  fully  okay  here.”  “Paul  when  last  had  Father  Arinze  visited  you?”  “not  long.”  “How  many  times  had  he?”  “once,  although  he  gave  me  token  sum  of  amount  that  would  take  me  till  I  finish  my  courses.”  “Father  Arinze  never  told  me  nothing.  He  had  been  calling  me  on  phone  but  I  have  declined  speaking  with  him.  Let  me  tell  you  something  Paul;  Father  Arinze  doesn’t  put  you  first  in  his  mind.  Forget  him  and  come  to  me.  I  would  still  accept  you  no  matter  what  Hillary  says.”  For  almost  one  hour  my  mind  was  confused.  I  think  again  that  it  would  be  stupid  of  me  changing  my  decision  of  becoming  a  seaman  with  Nigeria  navy.  Following  boss  back  would  be  big—spat  on  me.  “Sir,  expect  me  in  your  house  after  finishing  my  courses.”  Boss  looked  at  me  stupidly  I  now  seems  like  an  idiot  to  him.  “I  must  sue  that  stupid  priest  to  court,  he  had  cast  a  spell  on  you.”  “Not  as  you  think  sir!”  “hear  me  clearly  Paul.  I  don’t  see  you  graduating  here.”  “Why  sir?”  I  asked  humbly.  “Any  sorts  of  trainings  would  make  you  sick.  That  means  sick  ones  cannot  be  enlisted  with  Nigeria  navy.  If  coming  back  begging  me  it  would  already  be  late.  Now  is  that  last  chance  I’m  giving  you  as  rare  opportunity.  Would  you  follow  me?”  I  have  no  option  but  to  weep  in  confusion.  “Change  your  decision  my  boy  Paul.”  I  still  insist  on  not  going  back  on  my  decision.  “You  must  be  stupid.  I  can’t  wait  for  your  downfall!”  Mr  Collins  made  clear.  Provokingly  he  left  me  without  giving  me  anything  or  saying  goodbye.  “Paul  Collins  any  problem?”  “no  Japtan!”  “I  saw  him  raising  his  finger  at  you.  That  man  is  so  angry  by  the  look  on  his  face.”  “My  former  boss  still  want  me  with  him.”  “He  should  understand  life  is  all  about  making  favourable  decision  all  time.”   
Disturbing  as  it  was  I  couldn’t  sleep,  eat,  drink  water  until  the  following  day  when  Mr  Donovan  asked  me  question  which  I  responded  poorly,  thus  Mr  Donovan  wondering  cause  of  my  full  brokenness.  “Paul  Collins  meet  me  in  my  office  without  delay!”  students  in  hall  knew  how  smiling  Mr  Donovan  is  but  they  seems  surprised  Mr  Donovan  put  on  an  unfriendly  face  which  they  noticed  in  me.  His  lectures  that  had  create  happiness  in  us  ended  partially  because  of  me.  “Paul  Collins  your  problem  would  be  solved  in  Mr  Donovan’s  office.”  “Japtan  human  can’t  solve  our  problems;  God  only  can  solve  it.”  That  word  alone  assures  Japtan  I  would  be  that  person  he  knew  me  as.  In  Mr  Donovan’s  office  glass  of  water  is  kept  for  anyone  coming  to  visit  him.     “Paul  Collins  sit  down.  Drink  that  water  in  that  glass.  Is  usually  kept  for  anyone  paying  me  a  visit  when  am  in  office.”  I  drained,  asking  for  another  glass  of  water.  Mr  Donovan  now  see  I  am  responding  better.  “For  almost  twelve  hours  plus  it  is  difficult  for  you  doing  that.  Am  I  right  Paul  Collins?”  “of  course  you’re  right  sir!”  Mr  Donovan  laid  his  hands  on  me  while  praying  for  everlasting  happiness  for  me.  “Paul  Collins  someone  closer  to  you  offended  you.”  I  looked  at  him  for  more  minutes  just  to  show  him  how  surprised  I  am.  “Actually  someone   closer  offended  me.  At  this  stage  I  am,  I  know  what  is  better  for  me.  Mr  Collins  never  want  to  understand  that  in  any  way.  Help  me  out  sir;  is  it  advisable  for  me  rejecting  any  offer  Mr  Collins  gave  me?”  Mr  Donovan  leering  at  me  desperately.  “Sir  I  need  an  advice  from  you.”  “Umm,  you  may  know  better  than  me  Paul  Collins.  But  my  advice  should  be  sensible  in  dealing  with  such  an  issue  like  the  one  bothering  you  in  this  hour.  Totally  reject  any  offer  that  would  jeopardized  your  future,  Paul  Collins.” Shaking  myself  while  still  on  seat  I  try  asking  another  question  that  deserved  an  answer.  “Sir  I  was  given  a  chance  to  control  consortia  my  boss  owned.  I  reject  that  offer  more  happily.”  Mr  Donovan  turned  speechless  surprisingly  when  I  told  him  something  he  had  not  heard  of  in  his  lifetime.  “Young  lad  rejecting  such  kind  of  juicy  offer.  Tell  me  why  did  you  did  that?”  “I  did  it  for  love  of  my  country—Nigeria,  my  father,  my  mother.”  “Paul  Collins  I  am  so  dumbfounded  for  hearing  this.  So  that  Mr  Collins  is  your  boss?”  “now  former  boss!”  “is  he  a  cruel  boss?”  “Mr  Collins  is  nice  being  with  whenever,  wherever.  The  only  time  he  turned  sad  against  me  was  when  he  knew  my  plans  of  becoming  seaman  just  for  serving  my  country.  He  pestered  me  continually  for  me  changing  my  plan  but  I  insist  it  is  time  I  decide  for  myself  no  matter  hurdles  on  my  way.  Mr  Collins  went  into  his  room;  brought  out  his  dark  shotgun  as  he  couldn’t  believe  me  refusing  his  advice.  Mr  Collins  pulled  a  trigger  but  his  dark  shotgun  refused  performing  its  duty.  Now  I  would  say  I  almost  came  close  to  death;  I  survived  it  luckily  for  me.”  Mr  Donovan  pushed  away  textbooks  on  his  office  table  due  to  increasing  anger  boiling  inside  him.  “For  God  sake  that  former  boss  of  yours  should  face  the  law  for  attempted  murder.  Taking  someone’s  life  is  totally  unacceptable.  Should  I  personally  confronts  your  former  boss?”  “leave  him  to  God  sir!  God  is  not  sleeping  he  is  watching  everything  on  earth.”  Mr  Donovan  stood  up  packed  every  scattered  books  on  floor.  “Your  journey  on  sea  is  it  interesting?”  “so  interesting  sir.  We  campaigned  against  crude  oil  thefts  which  you  taught  us  about  dangers  of  it.  Some  poachers  were  spotted  shooting  a  big  fine  shark.  I  led  quick  awareness  for  rejection  of  that  act.  Commander  Davies  was  happy  at  the  end.”  “Continue  raising  awareness  as  citizen  of  most  greatest  country  on  earth,  Nigeria.”  “Doctor  Chris  even  lay  it  forward  to  me  that  illegal  oil  bunkering  is  bad.  I  support  him  throughout.  Though  against  his  ethics  campaigning;  Doctor  Chris  said  him  and  his  dedicated  colleagues  would  do  that  when—treating  any  patient  in  hospitals.”   “Doctor  Chris  I  must  meet  him  during  when  on board.”  Mr  Donovan  held  his  smooth  briefcase.    
“Paul  Collins  examinations  is  about  coming.  Read  ahead  on  time  do  as  I  say.”  Mr  Donovan  want  success  for  me. Mr  Collins  would  not  wish  that  for  me  since  I  turned  down  his  juicy  offer  gladly.   “Paul  Collins  we  would  see  later!”  Mr  Donovan  lurched  forward  in  his  hands  were  his  briefcase.  “Sir  thanks  for  your  advice!”  how  delighted  I  am  on  my  way  to  my  room.  Some  parents  were  hugging  their  children  same  route  I  was.  Absence  of  my  father  brought  forgotten  pain  in  me.  Mr  Collins  took  advantage  of  that  during  my  decision  with  him.  Visiting  hour  is  that  hour  I  was  heading  for  my  room.  “Paul  Collins  meet  my  father.  He  had  come  for  me  since  we  had  seen  for  over  fifteen  years.”  “How  are  you  lad?”  “fine  sir.  He  is  good  friend  of  mine.”  “Yes  he  told  me  everything  about  you.  I  am  glad  for  my  son  following  someone  serious  like  you.  Japtan  had  really  missed  me.  I  came  to  take  him  home  which  I  realised  it  is  not  permitted  for  now  due  to few  months  he  had  with  this  academy.  I  would  come  here  again  the  day  both  of  you  are  enlisted  with  Nigeria  navy.”  “I  appreciate  sir.  If  not  for  Father  Arinze  showing  me  fatherly  love;  I  wouldn’t  hesitate  to  call  you,  sir,  my  father.”  Japtan’s  father  looked  interested  hearing  more  from  me.  “Your  biological  father  is  a  priest?”  “Oh:  Father  Arinze  is  my  guardian.  Mr  Collins  good  friend  is  Father  Arinze.”  “The  Mr  Collins  you  named  is  he  related  to  you?”  “no  he  is  boss  I  was  working  for.”  Japtan’s  father  exposed  his  mouth  wider  in  presence  of  his  appreciating  son.  “Dad  he  is  telling  the  truth.  Paul  Had  never  lied  to  me  for  once.”  “Paul  someone  born  in  rich  family  had  good  look  you  are  presenting.  I  doubt  if  really  you  worked  for  a  boss  before.”  “Of  course  sir.  I  have  performed  an  housekeeping  job  before.”  Japtan’s  father  lifted  my  hand  up  as  he  still  doubt  all  what  I  am  telling  him.  “What  brought  you  here?”  Japtan  got  annoyed  with  his  father’s curious  question  that  can  get  me  annoyed.  “Dad  that  shouldn’t  bother  you;  Paul  is  here  based  on  his  zeal  of  becoming  Nigeria  navy  seaman.”  “Japtan  can  I  ask  him  just  one  question?”  I  grinned  at  Japtan  who  knew  I  am  displeased  with  his  father  questions.  “Dad  that  should  come  as  last  question.”  “Paul  what  kind  of  seaman  do  you  intend  being?”  Japtan  nodded  his  head  for  me  to  give  his  father  last  answer.  “Seaman  that  wants  an  end  to  crude  oil  thefts,  seaman  that  wants  an  end  for  pipeline  vandalism,  seaman  that  wants  an  end  for  illegal  oil  bunkering.  Navy  seaman  that  say  no  to  sea  piracy,  sea  murders  and  illicit  sea  activities.”  “Super  seaman  you  would  be  if  enlisted.  I  support  all  you  said  with  my  last  blood.”  Japtan  felt  too  proud  of  me  after  I  make  his  father  to  understand  the  kind  of  seaman  I  intend  being.  “Paul  I  must  come  to  your  passing  out  parade.  I  must  fulfilled  my  word.”  Japtan’s  father  made  me  look  superior  than  his  son  despite  presence  of  his  son.  “Okay  sir,”  I  gave  out  with  smiles.  “Paul  Collins  go  and  have  good  rest.  I  would  meet  you  later.”  Japtan  still  want  his  father  closer  to  him.  Jogging  to  my  room  really  stressful  on  an  hot  day.  “Paul  Collins  I  can  feel  your  gladness.  Mr  Donovan  must  had  discussed  with  you  something  tangible,  tell  me  more  on  that.”  Snorl  jogging  while  waiting  for  my  answer.  “Snorl  where  did  you  come  out  from?”  “That  angle  Paul  Collins.” “So  Snorl  you  must  had  been  hearing  my  conversation  with  Japtan’s  father.”  “Em, not  as  you—think.”                 We  stopped  jogging  walked  to  my  room  for  an  important  discussion.  Now  in  my  room  fresh  air  led  me  crashing  on  bed.  “Paul  Collins  don’t  sleep  now.  Let’s  talk  of  few  months  coming  when  we  shall  be  reaping  all  we  had  sowed.”  I  seems  napping  as  Snorl  was  talking  with  me.  “Snorl  tell  me  what  we  sowed.”  “Personal  evening  trainings.  Had  work,  perseverance,  commitment.”  Snorl  ended  my  nap  partially. “Imagine  me  being  a  seaman.  I  would  dedicate  that  for  my  late  mother  and  my  lost  father.  Then  for  Mr  Collins  I  must  forgive  him  by  paying  him  flying  visit.  For  Georgina,  David,  nagging  Hillary whatever  gifts  given  to  me  I  wouldn’t  hesitate  giving  them.”       
“Those  names  you  mentioned  are  they  part  of  your  family?”  “part  of  Mr  Collins  family.  Snorl  I  was  also  member  of  his  family  but  I  no  longer  wished  recognising  him  again  since  he  is  like  a  threat  to  me.”  Bugle  sound  outside  signals  an  important  information  is  to  be  passed.  I  rushed  outside  leaving  Snorl  behind.  “Coordinator-five  see  me  at  your  back.”  Students  lined-up  in  more  disciplined  manner.  Commander  Davies  hold  an  extremely  large  banner  for  unveiling.  “Students  what  does  this  banner  represent?”  Commander  Davies  asked  loudly.  For  minutes  no  students  could  expressed  what  the  banner  represent.  “Let  me  try  sir!”  “Paul  Collins,  academy  coordinator-  five.  What?”  “total  no  for  crude  oil  thefts,  total  no  for  pipeline  vandalism,  total  no  for  illegal  oil  bunkering,  total  no  for  fish  poaching,  total  no  for  illicit  sea  activities!”  “Yes  that  is  all  it  would  campaign  against.  Students  this  banner  is  blank.  Can  I  remove  the  covering?”  Commander  Davies  word  looked  strange  for  all  of  us.  Banner  he  held  is  plain,  not  even  covered  with  any  sealing.  Right  where  we  stand  our  mouth  was  widely  opened  due  to  surprise.  Commander  Davies  was  removing  the  sealing  that  hides  words  I  was  waiting  for.  “Big  no  to  crude  oil  thefts,  big  no  for  illegal  oil  bunkering,  big  no  for  pipeline  vandalism,  big  no  for  sea  piracy,  big  no  for  sea  murders!”  we  toned  jubilantly.  “That  is  all  what  Nigeria  navy  campaigns  against.  To  the  west  it  is  clear  is  bad,  also  to  our  Africans.  Say  out  loudly  I  would  forever  say  no  to  what  is  bad!”  more  repeatedly  we  were  making  recitation  against  something  widely  considered  too  bad  and  unacceptable.  Academy  trainers  start  engaging  themselves  into  an  exercise  not  far  from  us.  “This  is  that  time  most  of  you  must  accept.  Please  students  don’t  mind  the  sun  that  would  come  out  soonest.  This  is  the  fight  of  your  life.  Trainers  it  is  your  turn!”  academy  trainers  skilfully  spread  themselves,  we  were  grouped  in  number.  “Coordinator-five  lead  your  group.  Monitor  their  state  immediately  trainings  start.  Physical  fitness  is  essential  in  Nigeria  navy.  As  you  all  know  feeble  students  cannot  be  enlisted.  Few  months  would  come  as  one  day.  This  is  the  time!”  academy  bugler  signals  beginning  of  stressful  trainings.  Leading  students  was  more  hectic  to  me.  I  happily  coordinated  them  well.  At  the  end  I  was  orally  rewarded  with  praises  from  our  academy  trainers  that  had  been  setting  their  restless  eyes  on  me.  “Form  yourselves  again  in  groups.  Then  follow  us  to  the  hall  for  some  short  words  of  encouragement.” Most  senior  trainer  announced  vibrantly.     Within  few  minutes  hall  was  overtaken  by  large  numbers  of  students.  “Students  can  we  start?”  no  response  from  either  students  in  hall.  Their  tired  state  makes  them  weak.  From  their  look  one  would  know  that  any  prolix  speeches  might  make  them  more  weaker.  “Is  there  any  leader  that  would  speak  on  behalf  of  everyone?”  “I  would  speak  on  behalf  of  everyone.  It  is  suitable  we  start.”  “Being  a  navy  more  is  expected  in  your  course  of  duty.  Show  patriotism  in  your  daily  dealings.  Never  partake  in  crimes.  Show  selfless  services  for  your  country,  Nigeria.  Avoid  dodging  work  when  called  upon.  Show  how  zealous  you  can  be  for  love  of  your  country.  Avoid  taking  what  does  not  belong  to  you.  All  these  advices  is  mandatory  for  you  when  enlisted  with  the  Nigeria  navy.”  Such  advices  coming  from  the  most  senior  trainer  touched  me  deep  down.  He  is  a  man  I  never  expect  homily  words  from  him.  That  is  a  man  hiding  himself  from  making  any  advisable  speeches  in  academy.  “Cleanliness  is  expected  from  all  of  you.  I’m  happy  Commodore  Charles  had  never  let  himself  down  by  wearing  dirty  uniform.  Even  Commander  Davies  also  had  for  once  never  wore  dirty  uniform.  Nigeria  navy  is  against  dirtiness  in  fullness.”  Quick  round  of  applause  to  our  academy  most  senior  trainer.  Students  giving  him  more  applause  when  they  notice  he  is  not  ready  ending  his  speeches.  Learning  promotes  quick  reasoning  in  every  human  I  can  see  that  from  most  senior  trainer.  “Sensitization  ends  till  other  time  again.  Good  day  class!”  
 Going  back  to  our  different  rooms,  students  rushing  for  something  I  thought  to  be  examination  timetable.  “Paul  Collins  it  is  our  final  examination  timetable.  Our  results  of  examinations  we  had  wrote  is  out,  check  yours!”  Japtan  smiles  so  uncountable;  I  knew  his  results  were  very  okay  for  him.  I  begun  panicking  due  to  numbers  of  students  shedding  tears.  “Our  Academy  coordinator-five  have  you  checked  your  results?”  two  students  asked  ditto.  “I  have  not  but  I  would  check  if  the  students  checking,  reduced.”  I  sat  under  a  tree,  thinking  of  days  ahead.  Now  that  timetable  for  our  final  examination  is  out;  students  were  more  careful  so  that  their  stay  in  naval  academy  would  not  be  prolonged.  “Paul  Collins  check  it  don’t  be  scared.”  Japtan  encouraging  me  all  for  his  confirmed  assurance  on  me.  “Okay  this  is  the  minute!”  I  stood  up  gallantly  went  straight  to  where  students  were  converging;  checked  my  examination  results.  I  couldn’t  believe  my  eyes  seeing  excellent  in  all  exams  I  had  wrote.  “Yeah!  I  worked  harder  for  it.  I  have  few  months  in  this  academy.  I  am  dedicating  this  results  to  the  campaigners  of—No  against  crude  oil  thefts,  no  to  pipeline  vandalism,  no  to  illegal  oil  bunkering,  no  to  fish  poaching,  no  to  illicit  sea  activities.”  Students  clapped  for  me.  It  was  all  they  had  expected  from  me  since  they  knew  I  had  always  performed  better  as  academy  coordinator-five.  “A  speech  please,  we  need  your  speeches  since  your  results  was  the  best  in  the  history  of  this  academy.”  Japtan  want  me  to  speak  in  midst  of  happily  crowed  students.  “I  need  microphone.  I  want  every  students  to  hear  me  clearly,”  I  said.  “This  is  it  academy  coordinator-five!”  a  desperate  student  who  wish  to  hear  my  word  quickly  bring  me  a  microphone.  “Stand  over  there  coordinator-five;  when  standing  there  the  microphone  would  worked  for  you.”  I  shifted  to  where  I  was  instructed  to  stand,  signals  were  coming  from  microphone  I  held.  “Hello  students.  Can  you  hear  me  clearly?”  students  increasing  in  numbers  just  to  listen  to  all  I  have  to  say.  “Dedicate  your  results  to  the  campaigners  mainly  against  crude  oil  thefts.  I  have  also  do  that.  Not  that  someone  is  not  important  for  me  dedicating  my  results  to.  Someone  important  is  there  I  can  dedicate  my  best  results  to  but  I  chose  to  dedicate  my  results  for  everybody  campaigning  against  crude  oil  thefts,  illegal  oil  bunkering,  sea  piracy  and  other  menaces.”  Jubilant  noises  on  every  side  in  support  of  my  speeches.  “Coordinator-five  I  like  your  speeches.”  While  jubilant  students  were  making  scary  noises;  sound  of  bugle  left  every  students  quiet.  Nosy  academy  inspector  was  coming  with  Commander  Davies  to  where  I  was  standing.  “Commander  Davies  leader  in-charge  is  coming.  That  nosy  inspector  had  told  him  what  was  going  on,  I  would  support  you  in  case  Commander  Davies  ordered  for  your  punishment.”  “Japtan  I  would  say  I  am  matured  enough  defending  myself.  Leave  everything  to  me  I  would  prevailed  at  end  of  the  day.”  Commander  Davies  stern  face  is  another  reason  for  me  believing  he  had  got  a  wrong  situation  report.  “Paul  Collins  I  received  the  news  that  you  are  about  forming  your  government  with  full  support  from  the  students.  Defend  yourself  right  in  my—  presence!”  I  couldn’t  hold  back  tears  from  my  face.  Repercussion  would  be  severe  if  I  am  found  wrong  of  crime  I  never  committed.  “I  have  form  no  government  against  academy  authorities.”  “Then  why  were  students  jubilant  when  you  made  your  speeches?”  “Sir  it  is  about  my  results.”  “Is  there  any  problem  about  your  results?”  Commander  Davies  eager  knowing  cause  of  students  widely  jubilation.  “All  my  results  were  excellent.  I  again  discovered  my  results  were  the  best  in  history  of  this  academy.  Because  of  this  I  dedicated  my  excellent  results  to  campaigners  of—No  against  crude  oil  thefts,  also  for  no  against  pipeline  vandalism,  illegal  oil  bunkering,  and  other  illicit  sea  activities.”  “If  this  is  true  then  you  are  not  wrong.  Inspector  why  did  you  gave  me  wrong  information?”  angry  Commander  Davies  asked.  “Am  sorry  sir.  I  thought  I  saw  them  here.”    
“Saw  them  here  doing  what?”  “forming  a  government  with  Paul  Collins  in  charge.”  Commander  Davies  shook  his  head,  apologised  to  me  in  full.  “Inspector  that  wasn’t  what  you  told  me  in  my  office.  I  shall  forward  your  case  to  Commodore  Charles  that  you  had  been  raising  false  alarm.”  Again  jubilant  students  increased  their  jubilation  in  more  desperate  manner  after  Commander  Davies  left  with  academy  nosy  inspector.  “Paul  Collins  few  months  remaining  would  not  lead  to  your  downfall.  Your  dream  of  becoming  seaman  shall  be  a  reality  for  you.  Commander  Davies  now  knew  that  nosy  inspector  he  trusted  had  brought  him  wrong  information.”  “Japtan  thanks  for  being  with  me.  I  had  won  against  that  nosy  inspector.”  Six  days  after  checking  my  best  results  Father  Arinze  surprisingly  paid  me  flying  visit.  All  eyes  were  on  him  since  students  now  knew  he  is  my  guardian.  Commander  Davies  office  was  where  Father  Arinze  firstly  heads  to.  Commander  Davies  narrated  my  excellent  performance  in  my  results  to  Father  Arinze  that  kept  smiling  on.  “Father  Arinze  this  boy  of  yours  had  dedicated  his  results  to  campaigners  against  crude  oil  thefts,  illegal  oil  bunkering,  pipeline  vandalism  and  other  crimes  relating  to  maritime.”  Father  Arinze  smiles  limiting  bit by bit  not  long  when  Commander  Davies  told  him  how  I  decided  to  dedicate  my  results  for  an  end  to  illicit  sea  activities.  While  in  Commander  Davies  office;  Father  Arinze  sprung  up  to  his  feet,  asked  me  reason  of  me  not  dedicating  my  results  to  God  in  heaven.  I  defended  myself  within  seconds.  “Paul  God  is  supreme  over  everything  on  earth.  Still  I  expect  you  to  dedicate  your  results  to  God.  Well  am  glad  you  didn’t  say  you  dedicated  your  wonderful  results  to  me.”  “Father  Arinze  God  owns  all  wonderful  results.  Paul  Collins  knows  that  very  well.”  “Commander  there  is  no  problem  with  that.  I  will  support  his  zealous  goals  against  those  worst  crimes.  Paul  have  you  been  praying  with  your  rosary?”  Father  Arinze  noticed  my  rosary  wasn’t  on  my  neck.  “Yes  sir.  Presently  I  left  it  at  my  room.”  “Father  Arinze  I  saw  his  shining  rosary  when  we  were  on  sea.”  “Okay,  I  would  be  leaving  now!”  Commander  Davies  shook  hands  with  Father  Arinze,  begging  him  to  be  present  on  my  passing  out  at  the  naval  academy.  Father  Arinze  assured  him  he  won’t  missed  that  day  even  though  he  is  about  going  for  an  official  assignment.  “Paul  let’s  talk.”  Father  Arinze  spoke  with  me  in  a  quiet  room  opposite  Commander  Davies  office.  I  explained  how  Mr  Collins  came  to  visit  me  just  for  me  changing  my  mind  to  follow  him  home.  Father  Arinze  said  God  revealed  it  to  him  in  his  dream.  I  looked  up,  silently  praying  for  God  to  make  all  my  wish  to  be  fulfilled  coming  months.  “Paul  see  you  till  that  day.”  Father  Arinze  entered  his  car,  drove  off.  Months  later  our  final  naval  academy  examinations  commenced.  Final  year  students  finished  while  hoping  for  a  well  deserved  results.  Last  trainings  was  interesting  as  Commander  Davies  joined  us  jogging.  “Coordinator-five,  this  jogging  is  the  last.” As  planned  everyone  ended  when  darkness  surrounded  the  sky.  “Who  is  there?”  knock  at  my  door  awoke  me  up.  Japtan  had  come  to  passed  an  information  to  me.  “Paul  Collins  result  is  out!”  a  dream  to  me  because  results  came  out  final  day  we  would  spend  in  naval  academy.  “Is  it  true  Japtan?”  “last  month.  Last  day  we  would  spent  here.  Paul  Collins  tomorrow  is  passing  out  parade.  Commodore  Charles  would  come  to  shook—hands  with  us.”  “Wow!”  heavy  bang  on  my  door  makes  me  jumping  up.  “That’s  Snorl!” I  voiced.  “You  made  it  Paul  Collins! Three  of  us  made  it!”  getting  outside  academy  jazzmen  singing  in  melodies  all  putting  on  green,  white,  green.  “Day  before  graduations  that  is  all  they  do.”  “That’s  nice  Snorl.”  Sirens  from  convoys  make  me  believing  Commodore  Charles  is  on  his  way  coming  for  the  naval  academy  graduations  ceremony. “Paul  Collins, Commander  Davies  had  asked  for  you.” Usual  nosy  inspector  announced  to  me. Not  long  I  was  in Commander  Davies  office  sitting  like a  famous  king.
“You  shall  deliver  two  minutes  speeches  concerning—total  no  against  crude  oil  thefts.  I  hope  you  know  Commodore  Charles  is  already  here  for  your  graduation  and  passing  out  parade.” On  seat  I  gave  all  thanks  to  God  in  heaven  just  for  me  being  recognised  to  make  speeches  on  a  day  considered  more  important  for  every  students  that  had  finished  their  courses  in  Nigeria  navy  academy.  “I  won’t  let  down  trust  you  have  for  me  sir,”  I  expressed  my  gratitude  to  the  leader  in-charge  of  the  naval  academy.  Brighter  day  next  morning  dignitaries  across  all  walks  of  life  were  already  on  their  seat  to  witness  awards  that  would  come  to  best  outstanding  student  in  all  fields.  The  bugler  signals  through  the  bugle  it  was  moment  for  parade  for  passing  out  students.  Seaman  uniform  on  me  makes  me  looked  too  pristine  when  seen  from  far  distance.  Father  Arinze  praying  for  every  dignitaries  attending  such  a  glamorous  occasion  on  a  brighter  day.  I  knew  he  would  come  as  he  had  promised  Commander  Davies.  Parade  was  on  as  I  led  my  fellow  seamen  on  a  straight  line. More  applause  coming  from  dignitaries  shows  how  I  was  skilful.  Minutes  after  parade  I  was  on  stage  to  make  my  speeches  about  total  no  against  crude  oil  thefts  as  demanded  by  Commander  Davies.  Mr  Collins  car  just  coming  in  not  quite  long  I  start  making  my  speeches.  “Crude  oil  theft  is  bad  citizens  of  any  nation  desist  from  it!”  remarks  of  commendations  dignitaries  poured  on  me  led  Father  Arinze  giving  me  standing  ovation.  I  sang  music  that  ended  with  sonorous  lyrics, titled—Stop  crude  oil  thefts.  Guests  sitting  on  VIP  chairs  applaud  me  continually  until  each  of  them  stopped  when  Commodore  Charles  bowed  for  my  songs.  Commodore  Charles  took  stage  when  I  ended  all  my  music.  He  sang  naval  music  in  support  of  my  speeches.  “Award  here  is  for  the  best  student  in  overall  field.  This  award  goes  to  newly  enlisted  Able-seaman,  Paul  Collins!” congratulatory  messages  coming  to  me  from  dignitaries  and  even  from  galaxies  attending.  Mr  Collins  took  me  by  surprise  by  touching  me  on  my  warm  shoulder.  I  turned  in  a  smiling  mood.  He  pleaded  with  me  to  forgive  him  for  his  wrongdoings  against  me  together  with  his  wife  Hillary.  I  divulge  it  to  him  that  I  have  forgiven  him.  Georgina  and  David  who  expressed  their  full  happiness  towards  me  were  happy  I  forgive  Mr  Collins  for  the  sake  of  God  in  heaven.  Father  Arinze  who  was  there  shook  hands  with  Mr  Collins:  he  was  happy  for  me  that  I  have  forget  the  past  against  my  boss  while  in  tears.  “Paul  someone  is  calling  you!” Father  Arinze  alerted  me.  Commodore  Charles  held  my  left  hand  as  we  both  walked  further.  “I  noticed  a  mark  on  your  right  hand.  I  have  a  lost  son  who  had  that  type  of  mark.  I  don’t  know  where  I  can  locate  him.”  “Sir  is  your  wife  helping  you  to  search  for  your  lost  son?”  Commodore  Charles  wept  when  I  asked  if  his  wife  had  assisted  in  searching  for  his  lost  son.       “I  can’t  locate  her  too,”  he  said  coldly.  “Tell  me  her  name  so  that  I  can  recall  if  I  had  seen  her  before.”  “Paul  her  name  is—  Paulina!”  that  is  my  mother’s  name  I  found  on  her  letter  to  me  before  she  died.  “Paulina  is  my  late  mother’s  name!”  Commodore  Charles  asked  me  who  my  father  was.  I  took  time  narrating  how  my  mother  explained  how  my  father  went  to  Somalia  to  search  for  job.  Commodore  Charles  groaned  in  calmness.  “Paul  I  am  your  father.  I  changed  my  plans  of  going  to  Somalia.  All  this  while  I  have  been  working  with  Nigeria  navy.  I  try  locating  where  you  and  my  wife  were  staying  but  I  could  not.  Someone  told  me  you  and  your  mother  had  since  relocated  to  an  unknown  destination.”  Squalling  from  me,  also  from  Commodore  Charles  brought  Mr  Collins  to  console  me  and  my  father.  “Dad  this  is  Mr  Collins  that  gave  me  good  education!”  Mr  Collins  astonished  seeing  Commodore  Charles  embracing  me  still  in  tears.  “Hello  Mr  Collins,  this  is  my  son  Paul.  I  would  expressed  my  thanks  to  you  in  full,  thanks!”                                                                                                                                                                                               	
“Paul  is  a  good  boy  when  he  was  living  with  me.  I  would  missed  him  now  that  he  is  about  serving  the  Nigeria  navy  as  an  able-seaman.”  Nine  seaman  enlisted  into  the  Nigeria  navy  seen  marching  while  holding  Nigeria  flag.  “Commodore  I  would  missed  your  son,  maybe  we  would  see  again.”  Mr  Collins  went  straight  to  meet  his  family.
