Sanding the Oyster: the Origins of Shadow Unit

Think of Shadow Unit as a television show disguised as a series of short stories: TV that you read. Now think of the volume in your hands as the first disk in the season one DVD collection, complete with deleted scenes, bonus features, and the network teasers that led up to the show's premiere episode. Here you'll find, not just the first four published adventures of the FBI's Anomalous Crimes Task Force, but scenes, vignettes, documents, even scraps from the characters' on-line journals, that expand the episodes from the inside out.
A weird way to tell a story? Not this story.
You see, when I was a kid, I was a huge Man from U.N.C.L.E. fan.
Yes, that was back when it was first broadcast, and yes, I am that old. Shut up.
Man from U.N.C.L.E. episode titles were all in the form of "The [fill in the blank] Affair," and each act--the sections of episodes between commercial breaks—also had a title, in the form of a line of dialogue from the act. One of my favorite recreations was making up new episodes, complete with titles and act titles. I didn't know I was writing fan fiction.
I've been in love with TV episodic drama ever since. I've imagined the stories I'd write for my favorite shows, if I got a chance. I did write one with Will Shetterly: a sample X-Files script that was our calling card when we were looking for film and television work.
So when Elizabeth Bear encouraged the professional writers of her acquaintance to write fan fiction to reconnect with writing for pleasure, I wrote a Criminal Minds novella. She was right. It was fun.
But it also made me think about another show I'd like to write fan fiction for. A show no one had ever seen. It would share DNA with Criminal Minds, with The X-Files and Millennium, with Man from U.N.C.L.E. and the old paramedic show Emergency!, with The Avengers and a British paranormal series I barely remember called The Champions and a short-lived U.S. series called The Sixth Sense.
The show I was imagining had never aired. But why couldn't I write episodes for it? Why couldn't I write fan fiction for a show that didn't exist?
The setting and stories began to take shape in my head. Chaz Villette, already named and with much of his character baggage hanging from his long, skinny arms, showed up on my mental doorstep. I told Will about my foolish notion.
"Got a title?" he asked.
"It's called Shadow Unit," I said. It had never occurred to me that it was called anything else; it was as if I'd already seen it on the TV schedule and was ready to program it into the TiVo I don't have.
Will pitched in to help, as he always does. On a long book-signing road trip in the summer of 2007, we collaborated on creating the first draft of the series bible, the document that establishes the characters, themes, storylines, and universe of a show. A mystery/suspense show, a cop show, a profiler show—but with a science-fictional problem at its heart. An ensemble cast of smart, witty, capable people, each with a vulnerable place at his or her core. A single, unified what-if, that was only a little outside the laws of physics as we know them.
I thought maybe I'd write a series of short stories. Except this wasn't a short story collection. It was a TV show. It felt as if it needed more dimensions than just print on paper to tell it properly.
"It's a website," Will said. He was right.
He was also right when he pointed out that TV shows have a writing staff. I'd been thinking that, too. These characters needed more people to tell their stories. They needed perspectives outside my own, and a wider range of writing styles and narrative obsessions than I could manage. If they had that, the whole project would seem bigger, richer...more real.
I asked Elizabeth Bear to join Will and me in the writing room. She suggested we recruit Sarah Monette to the writing staff, and I was delighted. Bear also ventured out and came back with Amanda Downum to be the show's Art Director, designing, maintaining, and updating the website and creating the portraits of the characters. Stephen Shipman's our Technical Director, as site host and internet troubleshooter.
That was the oyster: a team of creators who were up for an experiment, possibly the best television writing staff that never wrote television. We added to the bible, to the world behind the stories, to the physics of the Anomaly and the complexity of the characters. Bear and Sarah each spotted holes in the Shadow Unit cast, and filled them with new characters who added even more depth to the history and mythology of the show. We expanded the storytelling into new forms. And my concept, the non-existent show I wanted to write for, became the pointy grain of sand around which those creators built a pearl.
Eventually Amanda and Stephen joined the writing staff. So did Leah Bobet and Holly Black. Photographer Kyle Cassidy came on board to create the beautiful, disturbing images for the covers of these pretend boxed sets. And readers found the website, became fans (they call themselves Deltas), and egged us on in our crazy endeavor. Three "seasons" later, we're still at it.
It's a bigger and shinier pearl than I could ever have imagined. And it's still growing.

Prologue: Anomalous Crimes

J. Edgar Hoover Building, Washington, D.C., January 8, 2002
Supervisory Special Agent Esther Falkner had been told more than once by people she trusted in the Bureau that her next assignment would be something prominent. Perhaps even chief of the Behavioral Analysis Unit, they’d hinted. She’d done good work there.
This cramped wing down the hall from the BAU, this echoing room smelling of paint and carpet adhesive, these empty clustered desks stark under fluorescent light—this was the opposite of prominent.
Falkner passed between the desks toward the far wall with its three doors. One stood ajar. As she got closer, she could hear the swift click of keys.
Inside, a man sat at a requisitioned desk on a requisitioned chair, typing on a black Thinkpad. He would have fit Mr. Hoover’s expectations—short-haired, clean-shaven, leanly muscular—except for the darkness of his skin. His ink-blue suit, white shirt, and dark tie might have been requisitioned, too.
The tie was silk, the shirt was Egyptian cotton, and the perfect-fitting jacket might have cashmere in it. Perhaps Mr. Hoover wouldn’t approve, after all.
The man looked up. Cold eyes. No; his face was still as frozen water, neutral as the wall behind him, but his eyes were intent, unblinking. Not cold at all.
She wondered when he’d learned to hide himself behind his own face. She’d learned how at West Point.
“Agent Falkner,” he said. “I’m Stephen Reyes.”
“Sir.”
He shook his head. “On paper, I lead this unit. But if you take the assignment, I’ll be listening to you at least as often as you do to me. I know you’ve heard it before, but at this end of the hall, it’s true: we need results more than hierarchy.” Reyes gave a smile that told her nothing. “But if we screw up, I get the blame.”
That might or might not be true. “When I was assigned here, no one mentioned what you were set up to do.”
His eyebrows rose a fraction of an inch, and his voice was dry when he said, “It was suggested we take need-to-know seriously.”
“Does this shadow unit have a name?”
He smiled suddenly. If what it revealed was honest, she thought she might be able to like Stephen Reyes. “The Anomalous Crimes Task Force.”
“That doesn’t tell me much.”
“It will.” When she hesitated, he added, “You can turn this down. It won’t hurt your career. You might even get brownie points for being smart enough to turn it down.”
She thought of her husband and her daughters. “This isn’t Mr. Hoover’s Bureau anymore.”
Reyes shrugged. “The FBI’s official position then was that the Mafia didn’t exist. We just have different secrets now.”
Falkner glanced around the bare office. Promotion or punishment? “I don’t mean to be uncooperative—”
“But you can’t commit without knowing more.”
She was good at her job, damn it. She deserved at least to know if that would be wasted here. “I think that’s fair.”
Reyes said, “What do you know about Brian Mikkelson?”
“The Tempe Skinner? Twelve known victims, all gay males. Possibly twenty more. The Bureau lost two agents taking him.”
Reyes spun his laptop on his desk so she could see its black screen. “Mikkelson made videos.”
“I never heard—”
“Need-to-know covers a surprising amount of terrain. This is a copy of one tape.” Reyes tapped the touchpad.
An elapsed-time window showed at the bottom of the screen. When the video stopped, it read fifty-two seconds.
“Faked?” She couldn’t wrench her gaze away from the final frozen image.
“Probably not. According to the imaging experts here, at Langley, and at Industrial Light and Magic.”
Fifty-two seconds. That was what it took to learn that the unimaginable was possible. To see that the boundaries of reality were further away than she’d thought.
Reyes blacked the screen. “Well?”
Falkner met Reyes’s eyes over the laptop. “That’s an anomalous crime?”
“One of them. This unit exists to find and stop people like Mikkelson.”
“So there are more people who can do that.”
“Or worse.”
The boundaries of reality had moved. Her job could expand to fit them. “Where do we start?”
Reyes pointed with his chin, out the door toward the empty front room. “Let’s fill those desks.”

Breathe | by Emma Bull

Act I
Los Angeles, CA, March 2007
Breathing comes first.
It’s a scalp wound. There’s a lot of blood. The water thins it to run and smear across his face and trickle outward from his hair on the wet tiles.
But what matters is breathing. His chest doesn’t move. His lips are turning the color people call blue, that isn’t.
She should be doing chest compressions—the heel of her hand should be right there. She’s holding the thing down instead. If she doesn’t let go, he dies. If she does, they both die.
Breathing first. His, hers, its.
Breathe, she begs, as if begging ever helped. Breathe.

•

Daphne Worth meant to be the last one through the briefing room door. New kid gets last pick of the chairs, after all. The others would have habits, and know each other’s. She’d take what was left.
But she had firehouse nerves—when the bell rang, you jumped. Not that everyone else hadn’t jumped, too. But to them, Falkner’s “Briefing room, please,” appeared to mean send-email-then-briefing-room, or fetch-coffee-then- briefing-room, or make-one-more-phone-call-then- briefing-room. So Worth walked into the briefing room with Reyes and Falkner—the two whose places she least wanted to sit in by accident—somewhere behind her. She looked around for something to pretend to be distracted by.
She didn’t have much to work with. It’s symbolic, she thought. Shadow Unit is in the closet, after all.
“Closet” was exaggerating—about the room, at least. But it could have passed for a good-sized storeroom, and it had no windows. Maybe they test for claustrophobia when they evaluate applicants. There was space for the rectangular dark wood table, six rolling chairs, a built-in cabinet on the short wall to the left of the door with a big LCD monitor in it, a whiteboard on the opposite wall, and walking room around it all. Barely. The pale ash-blue paint on the walls was probably soothing. Worth wondered how frantic she’d be feeling if it were yellow.
Nicolette Lau was already there, dropping a pile of manila Bureau-logo jackets full of case documents on the table. One side of her smooth layered black hair was tucked behind her ear. She wore a scarlet boat-neck sweater and narrow gray trousers; she made the room look like part of her accessorizing strategy.
Lau had shown Worth around the unit the day before. She’d talked fast, moved fast, and grinned like a kid who’d scammed her way into Six Flags. She’d managed to convey that the FBI was passable, and the Behavioral Analysis Unit (of which they were part) was pretty good, but Shadow Unit was the cool kids’ party.
Lau had probably never been afraid to sit in the wrong chair in her life.
She smiled at Worth. Outside the door Esther Falkner said, “You know he’s right. And you know it’s not fair to him.”
Lau looked toward the door. Worth followed her gaze, but there was nothing to see except a view of the desks in the bullpen.
“’Right’ isn’t my first concern in this. Or ’fair.’” That was Stephen Reyes, and from the sound, he and Falkner were at Reyes’s office next to the briefing room. Worth heard Reyes’s door close.
She turned back to find Lau half-frowning at the doorway. “Everything okay?”
Lau shook her head and put the grin back on. “Mom and Dad using the serious voices. It’d be wrong not to at least try to eavesdrop.” She tipped her head toward the chair at the whiteboard end of the table. “Reyes gets to watch the door. Otherwise it’s general admission.”
New kid also doesn’t get told everything. Worth rolled out the nearest chair and sank into it. “How do you prefer people to discharge their enormous debts to you?”
“Chocolate? Spa weekends? Phone numbers of smart, funny, good-looking single guys?”
“Cheap at twice that.”
“Here, have a case file,” Lau slid a folder across the table.
Before Worth could open it, Daniel Brady sauntered in and dropped into the chair beside her. The chair creaked. Muscle weighs more than fat. There was a lot of muscle on Daniel Brady, and a lot of Daniel Brady, at noticeably over six feet and a door’s width of shoulders, to wear it on. Add the sand-blond hair, coldpack-blue eyes, and a well-tailored light blue dress shirt and dark silk tie, and he took up more than his share of the room.
“Hey, New Kid.” He smiled, which at close quarters was overwhelming. “How you feel?”
Worth cast her eyes around the room, waved at the case file, and grimaced. “How many points do I lose if I say, ’Scared’?”
“Yeah, I remember that.” Lau tapped another folder before she slid it across to Brady. “You’ve caught a good starter, though.”
Brady opened it and flipped past the first pages. “Hey, no lie. It’s even blood-free.”
“I can manage blood.” Hackles down. Nobody cares about your macho here, Daphne.
Brady raised his eyebrows. “That’s right, you were a paramedic. Not a lot of people go from emergency med to law enforcement. One buzz is enough for ’em.”
“Well, first responder is all about nasty surprises.”
Out of the corner of her eye she saw Lau’s head tilt forward. Brady’s reaction was a lack of reaction. “We still get a few of those around here,” he said.
Apparently her new coworkers could spot a dodge when they heard one. Of course they could.
A tall pencil-thin woman with burnished brown skin and long dark-copper braids swept in the door. She wore oversized glasses with steel frames that dwarfed her fine-boned face. Under her arm she carried a laptop that matched the glasses; she balanced it with an enormous coffee mug in her other hand.
“You must be the new fish,” she said, clunking the mug (which was embossed with Chinese bats and full of coffee, extra-light) on the tabletop next to Worth. She set the laptop down carefully after it and stuck her right hand out. “Hafidha Gates. Not that Gates. I can actually code. I am, among other things, Priestess to our electronic demon-gods.”
Worth shook her hand. “Pleased to meet you. Daphne Worth.”
“Which, of course, I knew, but hey, we observe the forms.”
Gates’s eyes were an improbable violet, her nail polish was cobalt, and her braids were wrapped with thread in stacked bands of color. Rainbow...but with black and brown? Gray, white, gold, and silver—oh. “Bad beer rots our young guts, but vodka goes well; get some now,” Worth said, all in a rush. Brady’s head turned; Lau’s eyes widened. Worth felt her face heat up.
But Gates bounced happily in her chair. “You know resistor color coding?”
“My dad’s an electrical engineer. Retired.”
“Old school. I’m surprised you don’t know the politically incorrect mnemonics.”
She drew breath to recite them and thought, Easy, girl. “Not from my dad. I thought nobody used that stuff anymore.”
“Mostly not. But I am prepared for any eventuality. Chaz,” Gates called past Worth’s shoulder, “one of those had better be for me.”
Worth turned to see a young, brown-haired, sallow-skinned man, taller than Brady and even thinner than Gates, slide into the room and around the end of the table.
My God, thin. She’d once delivered an anorexic kid having a heart attack to the ER. This man was almost that skinny, from what she could see of his face, neck, and wrists. The rest of him was hidden by a wool jacket, a heavy crewneck sweater, a limp shirt collar, and corduroys going pale at the seams. It’s March, for pity’s sake. Cherry blossoms on the Mall in a week or two. It’s not that cold.
His attention was on his coffee cup, as if he expected it to spill. He got it safely to the table before he looked up at Gates and shook his hair absently out of his eyes. His cheekbones looked as if he’d borrowed them from a larger head. “One of what?”
“There are muffins in your pockets.”
His eyes widened almost painfully. “No, there aren’t.”
Gates lowered her chin, glared, and held her hand out.
Brady shook his head. “She’s got radar. Give it up, kid.”
“Before she jacks my Dove minis again,” Lau added.
The skinny man sighed. “Morning glory or chocolate chip?”
“Duh.” Gates wagged her extended hand.
“You suck.” He pulled napkin-wrapped bundles out of his jacket pockets and tossed one to Gates. When she caught it one-handed, he smiled. It stretched his wide mouth even wider, and showed white slightly-crooked front teeth.
“Fiber’s good for you,” Gates said firmly. “Have you met Daphne Worth?”
He gave Worth a startled look and turned to Gates. “I’m not going to be Shaggy.”
Worth thought she kept the annoyance off her face.
Gates snorted. “’Course not, Smarty-boy. You’re the dog.” She made it sound like a compliment.
“Duke can be Shaggy,” Lau added.
Brady nodded. “Good choice.”
The skinny man turned back to Worth. “Sorry.” He managed to smile and grimace simultaneously. She thought of a Discovery Channel special on frogs, and smiled weakly back. “Hi. I’m Charles Villette. Chaz.” He subsided into a chair as if his bones were dissolving. He peeled the napkin back from his king-size muffin, broke it in half, and ate one half in two bites.
Gates had already made the chocolate chip one disappear.
Esther Falkner swept in the door, snagged the folder Lau held up without breaking stride, and pivoted to lean against the wall next to the whiteboard. She made leaning look formal, and her navy trouser suit and crisp white blouse looked as if they could hold a lesser mortal upright by themselves. Her dark hair was pulled back hard and anchored with a tortoiseshell clasp. The style made an aggressive display of her pale handsome face, the creases around her eyes and mouth. It made her look as if she had nothing to hide.
Falkner caught her staring. Worth felt as if she were looking into a pair of surveillance cameras. But Falkner’s lips quirked at one corner. “Agent Worth. Finding your feet?”
“I...think so.” Worth cleared her throat. “I don’t really know yet. I guess.” Oh, the avalanche of stupid.
Gates patted her shoulder and said to Falkner, “It’s okay. We’ve got her.”
Which was embarrassing and comforting, all at once.
Falkner nodded. “It’s only a little weirder here than Down the Hall, really.” “Down the Hall” was the BAU. The BAU referred to Shadow Unit the same way. When they didn’t refer to it as the WTF.
“Except when it’s a whole lot weirder,” Brady said.
“Except then. Feel free to ask if anything seems especially odd.” Falkner’s expression was serene, her voice level. Worth wondered how she managed to seem ironic anyway.
Falkner surveyed the table. “Is Duke—Todd—in yet?”
“Still on the phone,” Villette answered, licking muffin sugar off his fingers.
“We can start without him,” Stephen Reyes said from just behind Worth’s left shoulder. If she’d had coffee, she would have spilled it. He must have got in the door while Worth’s attention was on Falkner. Had he noticed her twitch? Probably.
Lau handed him a case file across the table, and he squeezed along the wall behind Brady, Worth, and Gates to get to the chair reserved for him.
Worth had interviewed with him a month ago when she’d put in for the transfer. Usually she could figure out how she was doing in an interview. In that one, all she could tell was that Reyes could have written a policies and procedures manual for Daphne Worth by the time it was over.
Down the Hall, the descriptions of Stephen Reyes included words like “intense,” “charisma,” “animal magnetism,” and “obsessive high-handed son of a bitch.” She wasn’t sure about the last bit yet, but the first three seemed right.
He was shorter than Villette or Brady or even Falkner. His skin was a shade or two lighter than the dark wood of the table, and bits of silver caught the light in the pruned brambles of his hair. He wore a wine-red v-neck sweater and brushed khakis: Giorgio Armani on Casual Friday.
He laid the folder down in front of him; but instead of opening it, his attention moved swiftly over the team, as if rating each of them on some scale only he knew. Left to right, Gates, Worth (she felt as if she were in an interrogation room, and Reyes was the mirror she couldn’t see through), Brady, Lau, Villette—a fraction of an instant longer on Villette, an instant’s tightening of his mouth—and Falkner, who eyed Reyes back, perfectly unreadable.
Mom and Dad and the serious voices, Worth thought. That look meant something.
Reyes brought his attention back to the visible spectrum and Worth. “Agent Worth. Introductions all made?”
“Yes, sir.” Her voice was steady this time.
“Glad you’re on board,” he said, and smiled. It made him a different person. Human, for one thing.
“Thank you, sir.” She swallowed and tried not to let the rush of gratitude go to her head. If Shadow Unit weren’t at the center of a black hole in Bureau hierarchy, Reyes would be Unit Chief. He had created the unit. He’d been doing this four years ago when Worth first learned what Shadow Unit did. What she’d spent the intervening time getting into a position to do now. If she didn’t screw up.
“Let’s get to work,” Reyes said.
Lau rose like a batter stepping into a pitch. She was what, five foot four? She looked taller now, and cool, professional, focused. Worth mentally replayed yesterday’s conversations with her for things she’d want to live down. “We’re going to Los Angeles,” said Lau. “Five cases of death by suffocation in the last six weeks.”
“Oh, crap,” said a voice from the door. “Not Los Angeles. I hate Los Angeles.”
“They did it to annoy you,” Falkner said. “Where were you?”
The man in the doorway was somewhere in his early fifties, smallish and lean. He had brown thinning hair and bland blue eyes behind metal-rimmed glasses, and wore a corduroy jacket over an open-collared shirt. His hands were in his pockets.
Lau’s face broke from professional mode into the grin. “Hey, Duke.” She waved at the chair she’d just left. The newcomer ambled in and dropped into it.
“North Dakota ritual suicides?” Reyes sounded sympathetic. Worth wondered if anyone had ever said those four words in that way before.
The newcomer, whose name couldn’t really be Duke, shrugged. “I told ’em what they were looking for. They keep leaving me phone messages saying people don’t do things like that in North Dakota.”
“Wouldn’t that be nice?” Reyes said.
“If I lived in North Dakota,” Gates muttered, “I would.”
The newcomer leaned up out of the chair and thrust his right hand across the table at Worth. “You must be Agent Worth. I’m Sol Todd.”
Solomon Todd. Down the Hall the boys in ties—the new ones—rolled their eyes when his name came up, and sometimes mentioned hippies. Worth had noticed that the older ones didn’t. But you look so normal, Worth wanted to say. Instead she shook his hand and said, “Sir.”
Todd dropped back into his seat. “I am called by many names. That’s not usually one of them. But I swore to uphold the First Amendment along with the others, so I have to leave the matter up to you.”
Of all the difficult terrain of the last twenty-four hours, that required the most scrambling. “What...would you rather be called?”
“Oh, I’ll answer to anything that doesn’t already belong to someone else.”
Villette extinguished a laugh with a mouthful of coffee.
Falkner said, “’Todd’ for formal, ’Sol’ for casual, ’Duke’ for Fear and Loathing-related moments. Anything else promotes a disruptive work environment.” She nodded to Lau. “It’s safe now.”
Lau turned her right wrist and the LCD monitor came to life. Worth spotted the little oval remote in Lau’s hand. “All five victims died in public places, out of sight of witnesses.” On the monitor, a snapshot of a slender, smiling black woman. “LaDona Benson, age 26, in a supermarket parking lot in Studio City.
“Cristina Echeverria, 30, in a stall in the women’s restroom of an all-night diner in Hollywood.” A plump Hispanic woman sullen in a bad portrait, maybe from a work I.D.
“James Cookson, 38, outside the back door of the bar where he worked in North Hollywood.” A white man’s driver’s license photo, his face sagging, his eyes wide.
“Alonso Morro, 29, at a bus stop near Universal City.” Morro looked older than 29. Worth double-checked her case file. Lau was right.
“Gerianne Sussman, 32, another parking lot.” Sussman was round-faced, blonde, and grinning; Worth recognized a bit of the Dumbo ride at Disneyland in the photo’s background. Lau looked over her shoulder at the team, as if in punctuation. “Of Holy Cross Medical Center, Burbank.”
“She died of suffocation outside a hospital?” Todd repeated.
“Brain damage happens in four to six minutes in the absence of oxygen,” Villette offered, with relish Worth hoped was academic. “The victim goes unconscious well before that. Any struggle would have been short enough that it could have been missed even by witnesses fairly close by.”
He was right, which spared Worth having to say anything. But that was her area of expertise, damn it.
Brady flipped through the pages of the case file. “No crime scene photos?”
“They wouldn’t have been reported as crimes,” Reyes said.
Lau’s gaze flew to him, surprised; then she nodded. “Natural causes. The county medical examiner threw the flag.”
MEs were like that. Five unexplained asphyxiations in six weeks would be a personal affront. “The ME knew to call us?” Worth asked.
“Anomalous Crimes Task Force education and outreach,” Lau replied. “We try to make sure law enforcement and forensics around the country know what to look for.”
Reyes snorted. Unlike Villette’s squashed laugh, it didn’t sound amused. “To be more precise, we tell them when to call us. We never tell them what they’re looking for.”
No, Worth knew that from personal experience.
Falkner’s chin came up; but whatever she was going to say, she seemed to think better of, and turned the motion into a nod at the monitor. “I still see dead people.”
Three women, two men. Two Anglo, two Hispanic, one African-American. Ages twenty-six to thirty-eight. “Do they have anything in common?” Worth asked. “Other than asphyxia?”
“They all lived in the East Valley.” Lau shook her head. “Sorry—the east end of the San Fernando Valley. But that’s still a big pool to fish in.”
“Autopsy results?” Villette asked, hopeful as a terrier.
Lau raised one shoulder. “Just the routine autopsies in the jacket. No sign of drugs or toxins in the bloodstream, no external bruising or ligature marks, nothing in the victims’ airways.”
Reyes shook his head. “Routine won’t cut it.”
“Gerianne Sussman died thirty-two hours ago.” Villette said it without a pause to do the math.
“See if her body’s been released to the family yet,” Falkner said to Lau.
“We want it sent to Frost?”
“Unless she’s backed up. Is there a pathologist on the Left Coast we’ve worked with?”
“Brunelli at UCLA. I’ll check with Frost first.” Talking families into letting their loved ones be sliced ’n’ diced: high on Worth’s list of jobs she wouldn’t want. She wondered if Lau was good at it. Probably. From what she knew, they were all good at what they did.
What am I doing here?
“Catholic hospital,” Todd said. “Could be a religious component.”
Villette shrugged. “Hospital, period. Could be a medical connection.”
Brady leaned back in his chair, frowning, hands laced behind his head. Worth dodged his elbow as inconspicuously as she could. “If we don’t know the mechanism for the suffocation, we’ve got nothing to read mythology from.”
Worth almost didn’t ask. But there are no stupid questions. Only stupid new kids asking them. “Mythology?”
“The host’s understanding of how the world works and his place in it.” Reyes talked with his hands: the circle of the world, an upright palm and fingers edge-on for the hypothetical subject. If Reyes were ever allowed to lecture at Quantico on gammas—on the anomaly and its hosts—this was what it would sound like. “Hosts justify their anomalous abilities according to their mythologies. I am a special agent of God. The aliens experimented on me. I was bitten by a radioactive spider.”
Across the table Villette gave a surprised cough and resorted to his coffee cup again. Todd beamed at Reyes.
Reyes pretended not to notice. “Once the anomaly has taken hold in a host, the host applies past experience of science, nature, religion—their story of the world—to explain what happened to them, what they’re doing, and how they’re doing it. Just as mythology explained the natural world to early humans.”
“So...the mythology determines how the gamma kills?”
“It can.” Villette’s mouth flattened and stretched, and he frowned. “A blood clot, for instance, suggests knowledge of physiology, affinity for science. Massive bleeding from unlikely sources, especially if the physiological triggers are all over the map—that’s usually a little more Old Testament.”
Worth wondered if he’d meant to startle her. If so, it hadn’t worked. She felt rather pleased.
Reyes leaned forward and folded his arms on the table. “Lau, you’re a Valley girl, right?”
“Totally,” Lau drawled.
“Good. You and Worth cover the victimology. If there’s anything locally out of the ordinary, you’ll spot it.”
Easy for you to say, Worth thought, but Lau nodded.
“I’ll see what I can get on the scenes,” Brady said. “Could tell us whether this guy is up close and personal, or likes to keep his hands clean.”
Todd raised his shoulders, a constrained stretch that didn’t invade Villette’s airspace in the chair beside him. “Do I have to choose between Los Angeles and North Dakota, or do I get lucky and there’s a case that needs attention in some snake-infested swamp?”
“Hey!” Lau swatted at him. “My home town.”
“North Dakota has dibs,” Falkner replied. “We’ll call if we need you, though.”
“Let’s get some stats pulled together,” Reyes said. “We can look them over on the plane. Hafidha?”
Gates patted her laptop. “On it. You want the usual dirt, extra dirt, or the family-style dirt for six?”
“Residence, work, and medical history first?” Villette suggested. “I can start on the geographic profile—”
“Do it on the plane,” Reyes said.
“The—” The stop in Villette’s voice was so complete Worth looked up to see if he needed a Heimlich. Everyone at the table looked—first at Villette, then at Reyes. Everyone except Falkner, who was putting much thought into squaring the pages inside her folder and closing it. Villette’s eyes were wide, his face flushed like a bad sunburn.
“You’re going with us.” Reyes stood up. “See me in my office. Everyone, wheels up in two hours. Agent Worth, Brady will fill you in on travel protocol.”
“Can do,” Brady nodded.
They stood up, all but Villette, who looked as if he were recovering from being hit over the head. Reyes launched himself out the door. Worth grabbed her copy of the case file and stuck herself to Brady’s heel.
She followed him out to the bullpen. His desktop was relentlessly neat and almost bare; only the fact that the keyboard, the phone, and the desk lamp didn’t line up with the edges suggested he wasn’t obsessive-compulsive. “Ex-military?” she said before she could stop herself.
He turned suddenly, so she was too close to him. “Yeah. Trying to prove something?”
For an instant she missed his meaning. “No! I just— Sorry. I shouldn’t say these things out loud.”
Another beat; then he dropped his gaze. “But when you see something that talks to you, you forget nobody said it in so many words.”
“It’s hell on my social life.” She shifted her weight backwards, and didn’t care if it looked like a retreat.
“I get that. Okay, you’ve worked in BAU-Normal for a while. We work about the same way, only faster and more often on-site. Mostly because our cases involve more shit and a bigger fan. Got a go bag here?”
“Under my desk.” Worth caught her breath and added, “Lau warned me yesterday.”
Brady’s expression softened just enough that she could tell it had. “It’s usually table to tarmac around here, but they sucker-punched Chaz with the news. I’m guessing that two hours is to give him a chance to pack.”
As he spoke, Gates came out of the briefing room. Her braids swung as she turned to say something to Villette behind her. Villette’s shoulders were raised, his hands in his pockets. Whatever Gates said made his smile flash out and his shoulders drop.
Gates raised a hand, little finger extended and bent. Villette hooked his little finger in hers. Then he half-loped down to Reyes’s door and disappeared through it.
Pinky swear? There was something going on there. Romance? Not quite. And the business with the muffins— “I don’t want to pry...”
Brady smiled and sat on his desk. It made his head more or less level with hers. “Sure you do.”
Her face heated up. “I just don’t want to put my foot in it my first week. Is there anything I should know about Gates and Villette?”
“Yep. Just not what you think.”
She closed her teeth on “How do you know what I think?” and was rewarded with an apologetic shrug. He said, “Tell me what you know about basic gamma 4-1-1.”
And that, she supposed, was Brady’s way of telling her to mind her own business and stick to the job. Rookie status wasn’t forever, at least. “Gammas are people affected by the anomaly. The anomaly gives its hosts freaky non-human abilities, makes them unnaturally tough, and motivates them to do very bad things.”
Brady laughed. “Jesus, Reyes would burst a blood vessel if he heard that.”
“Too basic?”
“Not for me. But my short version makes him crazier than yours would. No, Reyes complicates it, but that’s the gist. So we—the anomaly-free population—are alphas. The monsters are gammas.” He leaned back, palms on the desktop behind him. “Far as anybody knows, Hafidha Gates and Chaz Villette are the world’s only betas.”
Not a change of subject. Not anything she’d expected. “They’re...” Worth floundered for a word, exact, scientific, inoffensive. “...They’re anomalous?”
“Freaky non-human abilities. You know about the calorie-burn in gammas? Takes a hell of a lot of fuel to do what they do.”
“Conservation of energy.”
Brady nodded. “Wait’ll you see Hafidha or Chaz eat lunch. Almost unbe-fuckin’-lievable.”
“But they’re—they’re not...”
“Dangerous?” He shook his head. “Also, gammas have an external manifestation. Their freak thing affects more than just the gamma itself. With Hafidha and Chaz, it’s all internal. Perception and processing. The anomaly doesn’t act directly on anything but them.”
“But it...acts.”
Brady nodded. “Hafidha says hers is like having perfect pitch for computers. And she can spot gamma activity when it’s related to something she’s got on the screen.” He shifted his feet and frowned. “She says things display in colors, and audio files get flakey. Don’t ask me. I have no idea.”
“Synesthesia?”
“She says it’s not.”
The big tough guy knows from synesthesia. “And Villette?”
“There are three Ph.D.s in the unit. Two of ’em are Chaz’s. Apparently, he moves numbers through time and space.” Brady straightened up, surfed his hands toward each other and interlaced the fingers. “He spots patterns.”
Worth looked again at Reyes’s door, now closed; then at the door to the computer room where Gates had gone.
Villette and Gates weren’t monsters. Monsters did nightmare miracles and trailed damage as they walked. Monsters didn’t laugh or tease or chatter or show off.
She’d sat in the briefing room and watched them eat muffins. Muffins they needed to eat. The brain drew twenty percent of the body’s total energy consumption. When the anomaly reset their neurological clock speed, did the percentage go up? And thin—of course they were thin. Gammas lost weight.
But Villette and Gates weren’t gammas. Gammas were monsters.
She turned back to find Brady looking sympathetic. “Makes your head spin?”
If they were dangerous, Brady would say so. “You’ve just kicked the crap out of my whole concept of the universe.”
“Yeah.” He levered himself up off his desk. “We get that a lot around here.”
Co-workers. Agents. Not any more strange than the rest of these strangers. “This is Villette’s first time in the field?”
“He’s been on a desk for the past year. He’s an SA. He knows the job—he just hasn’t done it yet.” He opened the bottom drawer of his desk and pulled out the brown leather duffle bag that filled it. His hands hovered over the straps, as if he wanted something to do that wasn’t talking.
“So which of us worries you most?”
His divinely-inspired jaw worked. “All right, if you want full disclosure. That’s a hard call. It’s not your first hunt, like it is Chaz’s. But you haven’t met our kind of boogeyman.” He concentrated on sliding the case folder in the side pocket of his bag. “It can throw you off your game.”
Worth thought about correcting him, and decided against it. “Reyes and Falkner must think we can look out for ourselves.”
He shrugged. “You’re probably right. You’ve met ’em. They do a lot of thinking.”
Act II
Reyes watched Chaz Villette cross his office like slow-motion pinball, touching and rebounding from the bookshelves, the window, the Chagall print. Not slow, really; just slow for a pinball game.
“You can sit down,” Reyes offered.
Chaz quirked his eyebrows, embarrassed, and dropped into the chair across the desk. Game over.
Body language was one of the mainstays of Reyes’s work. He knew how to control his own and read the subject’s, so he knew he looked comfortable and relaxed. Chaz looked like a dog ready for a release word.
But since Chaz was in the same line of work, it was hard to tell what that meant.
“I want to know if you’re ready for a field assignment,” Reyes said.
Unfeigned surprise. Chaz blinked, sat back, and dropped his gaze to his hands splayed over his thighs. What Reyes could see of his face was still and guarded. Good. If he couldn’t hide what was in his head, he had no business out there. The momentary pinch of regret Reyes felt was probably because he would have liked an excuse to forbid this trip.
“I thought that was your call.” Chaz’s voice was unemphatic.
“It is. I also trust your judgment. You know enough to be able to tell me if you should get on that plane.”
Chaz’s chin stayed tucked, but he lifted his eyes to Reyes’s. The light from the window caught the left one, the one with the colors in it, and heightened the difference. “After you announced it to the team? It would look funny if I didn’t.”
“Not a good basis for a decision.”
At the corner of Chaz’s mouth, a moment’s compression. “Even though you wouldn’t have said it in front of the team if you didn’t mean to stand by it.” He watched Reyes for a reaction.
Reyes raised his eyebrows and let him read what he wanted from it.
“I’m ready,” Chaz said.
“Falkner thinks it’s unfair to keep you at the desk. That’s also not a good basis for this decision, but I mention it so you know your judgment has backup.”
“Yes, sir.”
“Are you still a lousy shot?”
Chaz blinked again; an uncalculated smile split his face. “Most of ’em go through paper.”
He was better than that. But Reyes knew what Chaz’s firearms scores were. (And Chaz knew that Reyes knew, but the game had rules, and you broke them only out of need.)
Reyes opened his right top desk drawer, took out a molded plastic box, and slid it across the desk to Chaz. “Carry that.”
Chaz popped the latches and laid the lid back. He stared at the taser cushioned in foam, studied it without touching. “Non-lethal force.” He tapped the plate on the side where the voltage was displayed, and gaped across the box lid at Reyes. “Except this would be.”
“To anyone not affected by the anomaly. So see that you only use it on the host.”
“You found someone to build you a custom gamma-buster?” Chaz lifted the weapon out of the foam, gingerly, looked it over, put it back. “You could probably get thrown out of the Bureau for having this in your desk.”
“Then don’t let the guys at the metal detectors downstairs look too close. Keep it charged, keep it with you. You’ll get one full-power burst; that’s all the charge it’ll hold. If it’s useful, we’ll be able to make a case for carrying them.”
Chaz tilted his head, dubious. Reyes didn’t think they’d ever get approval for them, either.
“Strictly close-in.” Again, Chaz’s voice was neutral. Reyes wondered how hard he’d had to work to keep it that way.
“Insurance.”
“Not to mention improved odds we’ll bring the host in alive.”
No one else on the team would have said it aloud. “We don’t learn anything from dead gammas,” Reyes replied.
Chaz slapped the lid closed and hefted the box. “I’ll try to get there first, then.”
“Try not to get killed, please.”
“That, too.” Chaz stood. “Any more tests, Dr. Reyes?”
Busted. Reyes looked up, expecting something hard in Chaz’s face. But Chaz was smiling, the wide-open look that shone out with increasing frequency.
“You don’t have time for them. Call motor pool and get someone to drive you home to pack.”
Chaz was already out of the room, but he caught the doorframe and let it pivot him back to beam at Reyes. “No problem. Go bag’s in my drawer.”
And the doorway was empty.
Reyes propped his elbows on the desk and leaned his forehead on his laced fingers. Falkner was right. Charles Villette hadn’t joined Shadow Unit to ride a desk chair. And the team needed him in the field; his brain could save more lives than a weapon.
There was always a chance someone wouldn’t come back; and no loss was acceptable. This time was no different.
His left elbow rested on a folder. He slid it to the center of the desk and opened it.
It was only a sample of the documents; the rest were locked in the bottom drawer of the cabinet across the room. But Reyes knew every detail of the story.
The photo clipped to the third page stared up at him: a formal school portrait of a thirteen-year-old boy. Copper-brown skin tight over jutting cheekbones and long knife-blade nose, without the softness of puppy-fat. Brown hair cut short and severe, eyes staring into the lens, crooked front teeth showing between stretched, parted lips.
Not a smile, though a casual observer might mistake it for one. The eyes said, Keep looking. You won’t find me in here. It was a photo of a feral animal looking out through a human face.
It was Chaz Villette, eleven years earlier.
Hard to believe the eager, energetic, brilliant man who’d just left that chair had ever been that wary, calculating child.
As hard as believing the feral animal wasn’t still inside.

•

“We have a plane?” Worth said, stumbling on nothing on the ramp outside the gate at National. At least she’d managed not to squeak the last word. The business jet looked like the star of a photo shoot, reflecting in the rain-glossed pavement, boarding stairs beckoning.
“Gulfstream 450,” Lau called back over her shoulder. “Cruising speed mach point-eight, range from here, most of the Western Hemisphere plus Europe and north and west Africa. She don’t suck.” Lau’s family was Air Force, Worth remembered.
Behind Worth, Reyes said, “If we have to go at all, we have to go yesterday. I’m sure the GAO wishes it were otherwise.”
Worth bit her lip. Was the right answer to that “Yes, sir” or “No, sir?” But she was at the foot of the boarding stairs, and it was too late to answer at all. She followed Lau and Brady up and through the door.
The cabin was a cross between commercial first class and a hotel sitting room. And unlike the briefing room, eight people could occupy it with room to spare.
Worth’s first impression was of a haze of cloud-gray upholstery. She passed single seats to the right and left of the aisle, then a pair facing each other on the right side with a fold-out table between them, like a two-person booth in a restaurant. Across the aisle on the left a full-size couch followed the cabin wall under the round windows.
The last four seats were arranged two and two, facing across a larger table, on the right of the aisle. Lau settled by the window in the far front-facing pair. Brady stood in the aisle leaning over her. The filtered morning light glowed on them: Apollo and an unaccountably Asian Diana, faces unlike but related in beauty. Worth felt herself flushing again and fiddled with her messenger bag to hide it.
Brady nodded at something Lau said and straightened up. As much as he could, at least; he was an inch or two taller than the cabin. Lau beckoned Worth and patted the seat back next to her.
“Am I stealing your spot?” Worth asked Brady.
“Not today.” He smiled and squeezed past her as she slid into the aisle seat next to Lau.
She had a good view of Villette as he came aboard, leather backpack on one shoulder, for what was obviously the first time. He was also too tall for the available headroom, and ducked more than he needed to. His gaze skittered around the cabin, nervous and penetrating. Then he smiled cautiously.
Brady flagged him on. “You get the window. Damned if I’m going to wedge myself between you and the wall.”
Villette looked from Brady standing in the aisle, to Lau and Worth, and back to Brady. “Or I could sit right here.” He pointed his chin at the first seat inside the door, isolated from the others.
Brady stood his ground and looked patient. Villette shrugged, slouched down the aisle, and folded himself into the rear-facing window seat across from Lau. Brady settled in the aisle seat across from Worth.
“Aww,” Lau said. “I was going to let him sit in Reyes’s spot.”
Villette tucked his chin and blushed. “I had good intel.”
“Hafidha spoiled your initiation? No fair.”
“What’s my initiation, then?” Worth asked.
“It’s no fun if we tell you in advance,” said Brady.
As he did, Reyes came down the aisle and took the forward-facing seat in front of them. Falkner took a cushion off the couch, propped it against the back of the seat across the table from Reyes, and sat down. The “fasten seat belts” lights came on as if they had been waiting for her.
Then the thunder of the trip down the runway, the downward pressure of takeoff—and the disturbing sight of the Potomac close beneath them, as if the plane had jumped off the runway to throw itself in the river. It bothered Worth every time she flew out of National. She hoped it wasn’t an omen this time.
When the seat belt lights went out, Falkner clicked hers open and stretched. “Make yourselves comfortable. We’re non-stop and high-priority, but it’s still a big damned continent.”
“’Scuse, gang.” Lau slipped easily past Worth’s knees and headed for the front of the cabin, where she tapped on the cockpit door. Brady unrolled and headed for the bathroom, and Falkner followed as far as the galley.
Villette—Chaz—a Villette ought to be sleek and polished, and he wasn’t—eyed her warily from under a sagging lock of hair.
Worth scrambled for a conversational opening other than, So how’s this beta thing working for you?
Chaz canted his head to the right, which on his long neck looked just short of spinal fracture. “Did someone explain about Hafidha and me?”
Well, then. “Brady told me about betas.”
“Does it bother you?”
“Should it?”
His eyelids dropped before he looked toward the window, where nothing showed but sky. “It’s a little like bringing the monster along, isn’t it? I mean, I’m an anomalous individual.” He turned to her and stared, blank and cold.
Lau came up behind him and rapped his scalp with one finger, hard.
“Ow!” said Chaz, and the mask fell off.
“Stop trying to spook the new kid.” Lau slithered back into the window seat.
Chaz grinned at Worth. “Sorry. But you didn’t fall for it, so point to you.”
Another sentence or so, and I might have. “You’re sitting back to back with the guy who wrote the book on this stuff.”
“Yeah, but he doesn’t scare easy.”
“Am I not supposed to be able to hear you?” Reyes said without turning around. Worth could see the corner of a photo from the Los Angeles file on the table in front of him.
“Also, he’s not deaf,” Brady said, sinking down on the near end of the couch across the aisle. Reyes pretended to ignore him.
It gave Worth the nerve to say, “Then betas are hosts, too?”
Chaz pressed into the cabin wall so he could look over the back of his seat at Reyes.
The silence got Reyes’s attention. He twisted to stare over his seat back, first at Worth, then at Chaz. Window light reflected off his reading glasses. “You can answer that,” he said to Chaz.
Chaz hiked a shoulder. “I don’t like to talk about myself.”
Reyes took off his glasses and laid them on the table before he turned to consider Worth. Worth didn’t think he was as reluctant as he pretended. “We don’t know what the anomaly is. But we have models for how it interacts with humanity.”
“Genetic mutation. Virus,” offered Chaz.
“Brain injury,” said Brady, in a tone that made Chaz glare at him. Brady grinned back.
“Demonic possession,” Lau said.
“Or parasite and host,” Reyes finished. “But that model suggests that the organism is co-opted by the parasite. In betas, the human is in the driver’s seat, keeping the anomaly under control. So the host-parasite model doesn’t hold there.”
Chaz bobbed his eyebrows at Worth. See? You’re perfectly safe, they said.
“That’s probably why betas have no external anomalous manifestation,” Reyes added. “The anomaly doesn’t have enough control over the body’s resources to divert them to extranormal function.”
“Besides the brain activity,” Chaz added. “What that comes down to is, all our superpowers are up here.” He tapped his temple.
“Coffee’s up.” Falkner set a cup in front of Reyes and stood sipping hers. Chaz looked longingly at it. “You’re young and strong,” she told him. “Get your own.”
Worth turned Reyes’s lecture over mentally. “But you can’t know any of that for sure. You’ve only identified two betas.”
Reyes gave her a quick, sharp look. The professor was pleased. “The sample isn’t large enough. Chaz and Hafidha’s manifestations are internal and benign. Gammas have an external manifestation, and the host isn’t strong enough to keep the anomaly from doing harm.”
“Assuming the host wants to,” Lau added.
Reyes nodded. “Assuming that. But you’re right, that’s only speculation based on what we know about anomaloids so far.”
“Anomaloids?” Worth repeated.
“Individuals affected by the anomaly.” Chaz’s mobile face was stiff, and his voice flat.
“It sounds like a breath mint,” Worth blurted. Reyes frowned.
But it made Chaz’s face come back on line. “Curiously strong.”
“No, no,” Lau said. “They’re action figures. You feed them teeny tiny plastic food and they turn into airplanes.”
Chaz made an alarming noise, as if he were choking on a lung.
“I thought it was a muscle group,” Falkner said, unsmiling over her cup.
Brady rummaged in a pocket of his carryon. “No, isn’t that the stuff dentists fill cavities with?”
Chaz snorted. Reyes sighed and turned back to the case file.
“Who wants coffee?” Worth asked. Lau and Brady raised their hands.
Chaz popped up, flushed. “I’ll help.”
Falkner’s two cups weren’t the only real ones; the cupboard above the coffeemaker held a set of white china mugs. “Oh, thank God,” Worth sighed. “I hate the taste of styrofoam.”
Chaz frowned and tapped the can of coffee beside them. “Got to fix that for the trip home, though. Some of that grew on a coffee bush, but that’s all we can say with certainty.”
Worth set out four mugs. While Chaz poured, she said, “Brady says you have two Ph.D.s. Are you older than you look?”
An intent stare. “How old do I look?”
His substantial bones and shortage of body fat skewed his face older. But his skin was fine-textured, the shadow of his beard was faint and patchy, and his squint lines disappeared when he wasn’t squinting.
“Twenty...four, twenty-five.”
Chaz blinked. “Wow.”
“Years of experience figuring out what to tell the ER dispatcher about unconscious people in transit.”
“How many years?”
“Four. Straight into Quantico from there.”
“Why the Bureau?”
She thought about the complicated and sometimes-unpleasant story, and wondered if she wanted to try to tell it. Then she remembered the start of the conversation. “You don’t like to talk about yourself, do you?”
His face-splitting smile broke out. “Busted.” He picked up two mugs and headed back to the seats.
Lau had her case documents laid out on the table. Chaz set cups beside them and fetched his backpack from overhead. By the time Worth got her messenger bag out, his laptop was open across the table.
“Chronological order?” she asked Lau as she flipped open the file of victims’ records.
LaDona Benson was married, a receptionist for a dental lab, mother of two boys, ages five and three. Her husband was a mechanic for a car dealership in North Hollywood.
Cristina Echeverria was divorced, had joint custody of her nine-year-old daughter, and did construction and alterations for a costume company. Her ex-husband lived with his sister in Culver City.
James Cookson tended bar and had two convictions for simple assault, but no wife, or ex-wife, or children.
Alonso Morro worked for a lawn care service. He appeared to have married his wife right after high school, but they had no children. (Worth thought, But aren’t they Catholic?, and kicked herself for assuming it, whether it meant anything or not.)
Gerianne Sussman was employed in a studio clerical temp pool, divorced, remarried six months ago, and childless.
Lau sat back and scowled at the files. She made scowling look glamorous. “Well, that’s a big help so far. Chaz?”
Chaz blinked at Lau and Worth over the screen of his laptop. “You were right. They all lived in the east Valley.”
“Also not helping.”
Chaz dropped his gaze and shrugged. “Highly mobile population, lots of unrelated data points. Sorry. The one aberration is Echeverria, who didn’t die in the San Fernando Valley. But she lived and worked there.”
Brady stretched his legs further into the aisle. “Also the only one who died indoors.”
Five heads swiveled toward him in unison.
“We don’t believe in coincidence,” Reyes said.
“But it exists in spite of us,” replied Falkner.
“Correlation does not equal causation,” Lau announced. Worth didn’t understand why she grinned, or why the others stared. “Well, Duke’s not here to say it,” Lau added.
Brady nodded. “I’ll tell him you took care of it.” He raised his eyebrows at Chaz. “Sounds like you get some old-fashioned door-to-door police work for your first one, kid.”
Chaz eyed him from under his hair and seemed to weigh responses before he settled on, “Mmm.”
Worth flipped through the victim photos again. She imagined searching under that jaw for a pulse, envisioned lifting the quiet body that had been warm and active when the picture was taken. Would she forget, someday, the way those things felt? She’d learned distance years ago. One day it might turn into denial. She didn’t think she wanted that.
She looked up to find Chaz’s under-the-hair look turned on her.
“There’s no good way of doing it,” she said. “Dying. And they’re alone. Even when you’re right there.”
“Even the bad guys?”
“Maybe there are some bad enough that—I don’t know.” She pushed a smile across her face. “I’ll keep you posted.”
He continued to look for just long enough that she felt uncomfortable. Then he nodded and dropped his gaze to his laptop screen.

•

“You’d think anyone who’d flown into or out of Los Angeles wouldn’t live there,” Falkner said, looking out the window at the veil of yellow-brown air over the city below. They were belted back in for final approach.
Reyes shrugged. “People tell themselves stories. Usually boiling down to, ’It can’t be that bad.’” His eyes were turned to the window; Falkner suspected his thoughts were elsewhere.
“Not much to go on so far, particularly if the new autopsy doesn’t give us a mechanism for the death.”
“If they were easy, they wouldn’t end up on our doorstep.”
“Compliment duly noted,” Falkner replied. “Who’s our contact? The medical examiner?”
Reyes shook his head. “Donald Bostwick, Homicide Division. He’s the one the ME leaned on.”
Beyond Reyes, past the side of Brady’s aisle seat, Falkner could see Worth, when she wasn’t leaning in across the table to listen to Chaz or Brady or Lau. Shoulders stiff, the line of a small, focused frown between her brows, fingers twisting at the buttons on her jacket sleeves.
How many New Kids had she seen? In the army, then as Supervisory Special Agent? They dealt with it however they had to, but you never knew who they were until they quit dealing with it and relaxed into the job. Brady had arrived buttoned-up, stone-faced, and professional. Lau had worn a flawless PR glaze, as if life were a press conference and her future depended on holding a measured smile. Chaz had shown up in an ill-fitting navy-blue suit and and a painfully fresh haircut, moving like a coyote trapped in a pet carrier.
Now Daphne Worth was in the field on her second day of work, nervous and vigilant for her teammates’ cues. It was exhausting to watch. With a pre-med degree and a background in emergency medicine and BAU assignments, she could have come in overconfident, cocky, proud. Instead, she was creeping around the fringes of the herd.
Medium height, medium-brown hair cut medium length and worn pulled back, a trouser suit in one of the gray-tan indeterminate shades catalogs tagged “stone” or “bark” as if those things came in only one color in nature, and a high-collared white blouse. Dressed for success, if success depended on perfect inoffensiveness.
Worth wasn’t withholding herself, or her judgment. Chaz had done that. She was waiting for the others to judge her, and she was expecting to fall short.
Falkner sometimes thought her heart was a voodoo doll, full of pins. One each for Ben and the girls. One for each member of the team. She felt the new pin slide in and hoped for the best.
They landed at Burbank, since LAX was a ninety-minute drive to any of the relevant locations. Falkner wondered what the team looked like, motley and unified, striding through the terminal with their minimal baggage. Two cops, a film director, a corporate buyout team, and Chaz. Anyone who could invent a story that accounted for them all was probably already in show business.
The two eggplant-black Crown Vics waiting for them in airport security parking might as well have been stenciled “FBI” on the hoods. They’d be Police Interceptor models and ride like trucks. Falkner stretched her twinging back and reflected that this was what God made Aleve for.
Two new agents—it threw off who rode with whom. Before it became a question, she said, “Reyes, you want to take Chaz and Worth? I’ll let Brady chauffeur for Lau and me.”
“See you at the station.” He raised his eyebrows, which said, I saw you do that and Nice work.
In the back seat of the car, Lau popped her cell phone and put it on speaker as soon as they left the lot. “Hafidha, we’re on the ground and en route.”
“And speaking of routing, I now own a chunk of LAPD server and will be there when you need me. It’ll feel just like home. If you see Johnny Depp, give him a big wet kiss for me, will you?”
“Hafs, it’s the Valley. We’ll be lucky to see Jeff Probst.”
“Eeuw. When did that become lucky?”
Behind the wheel Brady cleared his throat loud enough to be heard in the next lane of traffic. But Falkner thought she spotted half a smile, there and gone. Good.
The rookies made him nervous. But even nervous, Brady stayed focused on the present and as much of the future as he could do something about. Two new people could make the team wobble on its axis, but if they did, Brady wouldn’t be where it showed up first.
Act III
Brady felt a little of the tightness go out of his jaw as they passed through the doors of the North Hollywood copshop. An angular newish building, designed full of contemporary ideas about community policing, but still palpably a copshop. Dallas stations had never posted air quality alerts in the front hall, but that was just dressing the set. When the lights went down and the curtain up, you knew where you were.
Reyes introduced himself and the rest of the team to Lieutenant Bostwick, and Brady shook hands when called upon.
Bostwick was small, strong, red-cheeked, snub-nosed, about forty, and not happy. “We can talk in the briefing room,” he said, and Brady doubted that anyone in earshot expected him to break out in Hallelujah when they got there.
What Bostwick actually said when they got there was, “I want you to know up front. I don’t think this is a real good use of your time.”
Brady leaned against the frame of the closed door and folded his arms. Chaz pretended to do something with his watch, but Brady was pretty sure it was self-correcting for time zones, and he noticed that Chaz never dropped his gaze far enough that Bostwick was out of field of vision. Falkner assumed perfect parade rest at Reyes’s right shoulder; Lau stuck her hands in her trouser pockets and stared at Bostwick as if waiting for the stunt show to start. Worth clutched the strap of her messenger bag and watched everyone at once. Her gaze crossed Brady’s, but she didn’t react. Good for her.
Reyes tilted his head. Not the bug-on-a-slide look, but the potential for it. “You think we’re on a snipe hunt.”
“I think this is bullshit by any name. You BAU people have helped us put a lot of murder cases to bed, and I’d be the first guy to call you in on one. But these aren’t murders.”
“Possibly not.” Reyes sounded mild. “Your medical examiner only flagged the deaths as suspicious.”
“If we sent you every suspicious death in L.A. County, you’d never get shit done. Look, my understanding is, the gold standard for spotting strangulation is a broken hyoid bone. None of these people had that.”
“Other way around, actually.” Worth’s voice cracked with nerves. “Broken hyoid is usually the result of strangulation, but strangulation doesn’t always break the hyoid. And strangulation isn’t the only way to asphyxiate someone.”
Bostwick frowned at her. She looked back, wide-eyed and unblinking. Brady managed not to smile. Well done, Grasshopper.
“Whatever. We waved you in, because better safe than sorry. But I really hope you can do what you do without a lot of local assist. We’re gonna be working homicides, and there’s not many of us and a whole lot of them.”
“One officer per 426 residents,” Chaz said. Bostwick blinked. Chaz looked up at him. “New York City’s ratio is one to 225.” He grimaced. Bostwick seemed to register it as sympathetic. Brady wondered if it was.
“We’re fine on our own, Lieutenant,” Reyes said. “As long as we have an office to work out of, we’re self-contained.”
Which, thought Brady, was a nice way of putting it.

•

Worth resisted the temptation to wipe her palms on her jacket as she followed Falkner through the front gate and up the walk to the Benson house. It was a 1950s single-story, that might have been called a rambler except that it didn’t ramble far. But it was well-kept, with a shaved-looking lawn and mounds of shrubby jasmine in bloom around the foundation. The scent made her slow down and breathe deeper.
Falkner rang the bell. The door opened promptly on a stocky black man in his early 30s, wearing a Lakers t-shirt and gray warmup pants.
“Darrell Benson?”
He nodded. The thing that crossed his face was gone so quickly that Worth almost missed it. The FBI was on the doorstep. No, his wife LaDona was never coming home. It took longer than six weeks to learn that lesson.
Worth half-listened to Falkner introducing herself, to Benson inviting them in. The living room was Target and IKEA and a little Pier One, plus a corner hutch that might be an heirloom. It was a comfortable room, one you could host the playoff game party in. The television was the tube variety, and must have required some determined carrying. She smelled cooking smells, and the jasmine through the screen door.
“I know this will be difficult for you,” Falkner said. “But we’d like to ask you a few questions about your wife.”
Benson’s face stiffened. “You think she did something wrong?”
“No, sir, not at all. We’re investigating the possibility that someone caused her death—that someone might have attacked her and several other people in the same way. In cases like this, we study the deceased, to see if they have anything in common. It can tell us a lot about the kind of person who might harm them.”
Worth watched Benson as Falkner spoke, watched him relax, watched him moving toward trust. Falkner’s voice was as perfect a thing as Brady’s face—resonant, flexible, conveying more than the words themselves.
“You mean like one of those poisoned-Tylenol deals?”
Falkner showed nothing but concern. “We can’t discuss that yet, Mr. Benson. The investigation is in the early stages.”
Motion at the corner of Worth’s vision. She turned to find a little boy peering around what must be the door to the kitchen. He wore a red-and-blue striped rugby shirt and clutched a red plastic race car to his chest as if it were a teddy bear. One sneaker was in the process of coming untied. About five—he would be the older son.
Benson saw him, too. “Vaughn? You finish your sandwich?”
The boy nodded.
“Your brother still sleeping?”
Again a nod. The boy’s eyes slid over Falkner and Worth, then away.
“My son, Vaughn,” Benson said, and held out one arm. Vaughn scurried into it and hid his face against his father’s body, and Benson’s extended arm curled around him. “Come on, now, say hello. You know how to be with company.”
Vaughn shook his head. Benson pressed his lips together and brushed his fingers over Vaughn’s hair.
Vaughn had learned company manners. Then his mother died. Now both he and his father were struggling to remember how to be with company.
They sat in the living room while Falkner took Benson’s statement. LaDona Benson was well-liked, friendly. She hadn’t been sick at or just before the time she died. She hadn’t seemed nervous or upset, and hadn’t mentioned meeting anyone new, particularly anyone who worried or frightened her.
“She called me from work that day,” Benson said, staring out the front window. “She said she was stopping at the market on the way home, and did I want something.” His eyes and mouth closed tight; then he recovered. You got better at it with practice.
“Would you mind if we looked at her things, at the rest of the house?” When Benson looked startled, Falkner added, “It could help. We won’t be searching, only observing things already in sight.”
He considered it. Worth would have, too, if strangers with badges wanted to walk through her house without a search warrant. Easy to say “We’re not looking for evidence of wrongdoing.” But it would be foolish not to wonder if they might, anyway.
“All right,” he said at last. “I’ll go wake up Ray.”
Worth’s throat ached as they moved from room to room. Every corner had life in it, planned days, a future. Next to the little TV in the bedroom, three exercise videos and a pair of two-pound hand weights. Makeup in a rack on the dresser. Hair shine serum and a stretch bead bracelet on the shelf above the sink, lightly filmed with dust.
“No aerosols,” Worth said aloud.
Falkner, at the open closet, turned and raised her eyebrows.
“No hairspray, spray deodorants, or spray cologne. In fact, no cologne or aftershave.”
“Hmm. Come here and tell me what you get.”
LaDona Benson’s clothes hung on the left side of the closet, divided by category. Office clothes, knockaround clothes, party clothes. The last included a bright flowered slip dress, and an orange-and-white sundress with the tag still on. “Borderline OCD?”
An almost-smile bumped Falkner’s lips askew. “Smell.”
Cigarette smoke. Not a lot, but enough to have penetrated any clothes that required dry cleaning and hadn’t had it yet.
“Huh. But no ashtrays. No smell in the house in general.” Worth sniffed the air of the bedroom to double-check. “She didn’t smoke at home.”
“Or she did, and it’s dissipated.”
Worth shook her head. “Even in six weeks—it would take carpet shampoo and a lot of laundering. Unless her husband wanted to wash that part of her away?”
“Let’s finish the circuit.”
There was less of LaDona Benson around the kitchen; Benson had to go on feeding his kids, even if he couldn’t do it the way he used to, or the way his wife had.
Worth went to the phone on the kitchen counter, looking for notes or numbers. On the counter beside it was a metered-dose inhaler.
“Eureka.”
Falkner came up behind her, and Worth pointed.
“LaDona Benson had asthma?”
Worth picked up the inhaler and shook her head. “See the tube on the end? That’s an asthma spacer. Inhaler sequence can be hard for little kids to master. The spacer mixes the bronchodilator with air in the tube, so a child can inhale the correct dose even without getting the sequence down.”
“So no aerosols, no perfumes. And she didn’t smoke at home.”
Worth looked up to find Vaughn in the hall, hugging the wall and watching. She squatted down and held out the inhaler. “Hi, Vaughn. My name is Daphne. This is yours, huh?”
He dropped his eyes and nodded.
“These can be tricky to use. Like a really hard video game. Was it hard to learn?”
He shrugged.
“Have you had it a long time?”
Vaughn looked up, shook his head. “I had to go to the hospital.”
“Did you go in an ambulance?”
“Yeah.”
“I used to drive an ambulance. It was fun, but it was scary, too, because the people I was driving needed help. Were you scared?”
Vaughn nodded, staring at her. “I couldn’t breathe.”
“That would have scared me, too. You know to keep this with you all the time?”
Vaughn nodded again, solemn with responsibility. Another thing to make Worth’s throat hurt.
“Do you remember the name of the hospital you went to?”
He didn’t, so they found Benson, sitting in the living room with his three-year-old son on his lap. “Mr. Benson,” Falkner said, “How long has Vaughn had asthma?”
“We only found out first of the year. We went to the Rose Parade, and he was running around looking at the floats. And then that night he was coughing, and he couldn’t breathe right, and we called 911.”
“What hospital was he treated at?”
“In Burbank, the big one by the 134. Holy Cross.”
Worth managed, barely, not to shoot a look at Falkner. “Was he treated in the ER and released, or did they keep him overnight?”
“Overnight. They let LaDona stay with him. Then he had another trip, end of the month. He forgot his medicine at daycare, and we had to get him some help.”
“Holy Cross again?” Falkner asked.
“Yeah.”
“Did your wife smoke?” Worth asked. It was the thing you took for granted that tripped you up, after all.
Benson looked startled. “She never smoked much. But after Vaughn got sick she didn’t smoke at home. She was trying to quit.” His throat worked, a hard swallow, and he looked down when his younger son yanked on his wristwatch.
Falkner said the polite things that led to getting them out the door and restoring Benson’s privacy. The scent of jasmine followed them down the walk.
“It could be coincidence,” Worth offered once they were out of earshot of the house.
Falkner flexed her neck and shoulders and winced. “You heard Reyes on the subject. A victim who dies of asphyxiation, whose child has a respiratory illness and is treated at the same hospital where another victim dies in the parking lot.”
Worth bit the inside of her lip. Coincidence was possible; it just wasn’t likely. “Put that way, it almost sounds obvious. But if the medical examiner hadn’t spotted a pattern... There’d be more and more LaDona Bensons.”
Falkner unlocked the driver’s door. “We were lucky this time.”
Lucky. “The Bensons weren’t. And the other four families.”
Falkner stood still in the open car door. “Go on.”
Oh, God, she should shut up. But it was too late now. “We count on luck. And five people die. We explain to local law enforcement what they’re looking for without telling them what they’re looking for, and nobody’s sure when to blow the whistle, and by the time the unit gets here there’s a trail of bodies. That’s how it works, right?”
“It still bothers you, doesn’t it?”
Worth opened her mouth. Tone it down, girl. She changed, God damn right to “It bothers me that we don’t tell them. That we cover up.”
“That we covered up after the incident you witnessed.”
Falkner’s voice and face were calm, but Worth felt it like a blow to the throat. You buried things, you sank them in the lake of the past. But they bobbed to the surface.
Quick thinking, everyone had said to her afterward. The man who’d shown his FBI credentials and taken pity on her and explained a little of what had just happened, had said it. But really, she’d been lucky. Vin and Josh hadn’t been.
She was angry. She must have been angry for a long time. She pressed her hands hard against the side of the car, low down out of Falkner’s line of sight, until the joints hurt. A deep breath, so she wouldn’t sound angry. “If we’d been warned what could happen, we’d have been more careful. The guys I worked with might still be alive.”
“But you know why we do it,” said Falkner. She was relentlessly calm.
“I know why we say we do.”
“What happens when the general public looks at any schizophrenic, any shell-shocked homeless vet, any kid with impulse control problems, anyone whose particular variety of strange they don’t get, and sees anomaly? And what happens when we tell them we don’t know what the anomaly is, or how to reverse the effects? And that, given the available knowledge and resources, they may not be able to do anything about it except shoot the host down like a rabid dog?”
“I understand that—”
“Good. Now picture it. Then imagine how many ambulance crews, knowing those things, would think twice before they stepped in to help a victim, for fear it might be a monster in disguise.”
In the rattle of thoughts in Worth’s head, one came clear: She knew she would need to say this to me. It shamed her. “I’m sorry. You’re right.”
“No, I’m doing the best I can with what I’ve got. We all are. Whether we’re right remains to be seen.” Falkner opened the door on her side. “We should go. Before the neighbors call to report suspicious loitering.” She slid into the driver’s seat, out of Worth’s view.
Giving Worth a private moment. She took another breath and let it out slowly. I could do worse than grow up to be Esther Falkner.
She got in and fastened her belt, while Falkner started the car. “What’s our next step?”
“Sic Hafidha on the medical records. And see what the rest of the team comes up with.” Falkner glanced over at Worth. “You did good work in there.”
Encouraging the Rookie. Worth clutched at it, even knowing what it was. “Thanks.”
Falkner turned into traffic on Lankershim and said, “How would you describe yourself on the job?”
Hopeless. Awkward. Inclined to quarrel with superiors, apparently. “Competent?” Worth said. It sounded like overstatement.
Falkner watched traffic, her face unchanging. Four blocks later, she pulled to the curb along a row of brick storefronts and opened the driver’s door.
“What are we—”
“Feeding the troops.” Falkner jerked her head at the window stenciled Araz Bakery. “Everybody loves a good quartermaster.”

•

Across the street from the late James Cookson’s apartment building, a film crew was shooting. The street where Brady would have parked was filled with grip trucks, wardrobe trailers, and dressing rooms. Power cables looped down the sidewalk like orderly boa constrictors. Scaffolding climbed a gray-block office building and pointed a pair of instruments, like nosy neighbors, in a window to make dawn, or sunset, or whatever the sun itself wasn’t up to providing.
In the passenger seat, Chaz craned his neck, which was always a sight. “Wonder what that’s like? To wake up and find a movie set in your front yard?”
“No unexpected weirdness in Vegas?”
Chaz’s chin came up and his eyelids dropped halfway. Armor. Brady wondered why. “It’s mostly quarantined. Fremont Street and the Strip.”
“If I’d grown up in Vegas, maybe I could beat you at poker.”
Chaz popped his seatbelt and smiled kindly. “Nah.”
Better, Brady thought, as they went in search of the manager.
The manager looked about 90, and Brady worried about him on the outside stairs to the second floor. But he arrived intact and unlocked the door. “Tell me when you’re done. I get shit from the family if there’s anything missing.” The old guy ran his hand through the half-dozen hairs he had left. “Though so far there’s just the shiksa.”
“A girlfriend?” Chaz asked.
“She comes over and they fight. Probably they go to her place and fight, too. Is that what you do with your girlfriend?”
Chaz was still his wintertime unhealthy yellow-gray, so Brady could see the blood climb up his neck to his face. “Do you know her name?” Brady asked the manager.
“And phone number, and address. Like I say, she thinks she’s next of kin.” The old man crept back down the stairs.
When Brady opened the apartment door, stale air stinking of old cigarettes and old beer and old laundry and a faint dumpster smell of ripe kitchen trash bloomed out onto the balcony. The room beyond the door felt empty. He noted the presence and weight of the holster at his belt anyway; second nature, now. But he was pleased when Chaz unbuttoned his jacket to have access to his own.
On Chaz’s belt, on the side opposite the holster, was an open-topped case. And it wasn’t for a graphing calculator.
“What’s that?” Brady said, though he knew.
Chaz looked past him into the apartment, expressionless. “Taser. Reyes’s idea.”
Of course it was. Shit. And he gave it to Chaz because Chaz was the only person on the team who would consider something as stupid as using it. Brady must have taken a little too long to respond; Chaz’s gaze swiveled around to him and stayed there, like an owl examining the landscape.
So Brady said, “I’m not going to die for Reyes’s bring-’em-back-alive campaign. You do as you please. But if you fail to pull your weapon and someone else hurts for it, believe me, there will be no hole deep enough to bury either the investigation or you.”
Chaz’s mouth skewed, as if he was biting the inside of his lip. “Fair enough,” he said.
It seemed Chaz, like Reyes, didn’t scare easy. Brady wasn’t sure that was comforting.
He stepped into the apartment with Chaz behind him. They didn’t close the door—it wasn’t an atmosphere you wanted to be closed in with.
A vinyl sofa from Goodwill, a blanket up for a window covering (nothing said “slum” like an apartment building with blankets in the windows), a 19 inch TV with an old cable box on top. Three ashtrays, mostly full. At some point one had fallen and dumped its contents behind the TV stand and never been swept up after.
There was an empty beer can and a dirty plate on the coffee table. Chaz popped a lime-green nitrile glove out of his pocket, stretched it onto his long, knuckly hand, picked up the can, and shook it. “Cigarette butt,” he said, uninflected.
“You knew there would be.” Under the TV Guide Brady saw the edge of an envelope from a photo developer. He put on a glove of his own and slid it out. Five prints—Cookson, less sullen than in the photo the team had, his arm around a wide-smiling, full-bodied redhead, indoors at what looked like a car show. Brady shook the negatives out of the envelope, held them to the light. A 24-exposure roll. “So where are the other nineteen prints?”
They found them by the bed. They featured the redhead, and were the sort of photos one kept in the bedroom. Chaz raised his eyebrows. “Extroverted.”
Brady laughed. It was easier to laugh when you suspected being alive wouldn’t have improved the victim.
The bathroom was grubby, but free of prescription meds, illegal substances, or any parole-violating or otherwise potentially toxic items. The kitchen was bleak: an open box of cereal, Hungry Man canned soup, an opened carton of cigarettes, a half-gallon of milk gone sour, and the remains of a twelve-pack of Bud. Brady decided to leave the trash for the CSIs.
Chaz began to open drawers. “Hey,” he said. He held up a checkbook.
“Funny place to keep it.”
Chaz shrugged. “Cookson doesn’t—didn’t have a computer. He’d write checks for bills and rent.” He flipped open the register and began to work backward. “Huh. $2562 to Bonnie Gilberti, two days before he died.”
“That’s a chunk of change for a guy who tends bar.”
“The girlfriend?”
“Let’s go ask the mummified Mr. Rogers.”
According to the manager, Bonnie Gilberti was, indeed, the girlfriend. He gave them her address.
Gilberti lived in an atrium apartment building in a mixed-use neighborhood wedged between the Burbank airport and the rail line, within hearing of the constant rumble of I-5. When they knocked on her door, she opened it, listened to what they’d come for in silence, then turned and walked back into the apartment, leaving them to come in and close the door.
Chaz rolled his eyes at Brady like a wary dog. Brady shrugged, and followed Gilberti into her kitchen.
In as far as he could, at least, and Chaz sidled in after him. It was a slot of room with shrunken appliances, a shallow, dented single-bowl sink, and no window. Gilberti cranked the hot water handle on the faucet and started—or resumed—washing dishes.
Brady thought Gilberti might have been pretty in high school. She’d frowned a lot since then, and stayed up too late, and worked too hard. His mother would have said she looked “peaked,” a word with two syllables that balanced sympathy and superiority in a very small space.
“Jim fucked up, he did time. I know that. And then he turned his life around.” Gilberti swept clean plates out of the sink drainer and smacked them on a stack of others in the cheap cupboards. Chaz flinched at the sound. Brady could see the pulse jump in his neck and the muscles in his jaw stand out. What in this sad, cluttered little apartment could wind him so tight? “But it was an accident, him dying. He wasn’t on any shit, and he wasn’t into anything. So you can go do real F-B-fucking-I shit now.”
They’d have to tell Bostwick he wasn’t alone in his opinion. “Did Mr. Cookson have any enemies?” Brady asked.
She turned from the sink, her mouth an O of pearlescent lipstick. “God, dozens.”
Chaz’s eyebrows rose.
“Well, what did you think? He loses his temper. He takes a poke at somebody. Hello, not Mother Damn Theresa. His boss fucking hates...hated him.” The muscles pinched around her eyes and she turned back to the sink.
Brady watched Chaz scan and catalog the kitchen. He’d get a download on that once they left. “Ms. Gilberti, Cookson wrote you a check two days before he died. For $2562.”
She looked blank. “Oh! Yeah, so I could sign it over to the hospital. I got no insurance, and I had to pay the hospital.”
“Hospital?” You could almost see Chaz’s ears point, like a dog hearing a can opener. “You’ve been sick?”
Gilberti’s face closed up so fast Brady could hear it slam. “No, I just like to go to the hospital.”
“Sorry.” Chaz wilted visibly. “Dumb question.”
Next time, gag Chaz, Brady thought, and gathered himself to take the conversation back.
But Chaz beat him to it. “It’s just... There’s been a series of weird deaths, and Mr. Cookson’s is one of them. So we’re looking for connections. One of the other deaths happened in a hospital parking lot, so...” Chaz shrugged.
“Ohmygod,” Gilberti whispered.
Well, well. Witness was off-guard, alarmed, softened up. Maybe an accident, or maybe the kid knew a thing or two.
“What hospital did you go to?” Brady asked.
“Holy Cross—is that where the other guy died?”
Chaz shrugged and did the absurd thing with his mouth. “Not at liberty to say.”
“Ohmygod.”
“It’s all right, ma’am. You’re not in danger.” Though Brady had no proof of that.
Chaz’s gaze wandered vaguely across the kitchen again. “What did you go to the hospital for?”
Gilberti scowled at Chaz. “Something that’s not your damned business.”
Well, the bloom was off that rose.
Brady wound up the visit with thank you and you’ve been an enormous help and got them both down to the building parking lot unscathed.
“What next?” Chaz asked, sliding onto the bench seat of the car and buckling up. Brady thought he was working a little too hard to look at his hands, his knees, the dashboard, and the view out the windshield.
“The bar where Cookson worked. I don’t think we’ll get anything more than confirmation that he was a son of a bitch, but I’d like to see where he died.” Brady started the car.
Chaz studied the view a little longer before he said, “She had eight different nutritional supplements on the counter. The bottles were over half full. Either she was diagnosed with a metabolic disorder, or she’s pregnant. The open box of Saltines suggests the latter.”
“Huh.” Nice job. Would Chaz object to being told so? One way to find out. “Nice job.”
Chaz’s gaze bounced up to Brady, zipped away again. He straightened against the seat back, and the twitchy grimace that might be a smile shot across his face and was gone.

•

Its head has been underwater for—how long? And it still struggles. It still takes all her weight to hold it down.
Not “it”—host and parasite, and the host is a human being, with a name and a past. But the unnatural strength makes an It of the thing beneath her.
And he still hasn’t taken a breath. Injury to brain cells after four minutes. Irreversible brain damage in seven.
Act IV
The space Bostwick had allotted the team was a small meeting room with a long folding table and no windows. Lau wanted to tell him it felt just like home.
She’d set up her laptop and the portable printer on a metal cabinet against one wall and liberated an enormous whiteboard from a back room at the copshop. When Worth and Falkner came in, Reyes was pulling hypothetically-inaccessible medical records off the printer. (Thank you, Hafidha.) Lau was making columns on the whiteboard, one for each victim and one for their killer. That last one was blank, and it bugged her.
The smell of dry-erase marker always made her think of murder and frustration.
Falkner set a brown paper grocery bag lightly marked with grease spots on the table. Worth did the same with the one she carried.
“The proprietor says hello,” Falkner told her. “I got the feeling he didn’t ordinarily bake these this late in the day.” She asked a question with her eyebrows.
Lau gave her a one-palm-up shrug. “I went to school with his son. Eight cheese-and-pepper beoreks, six cheese, and a dozen mamoul?”
“It’s a lot of food,” Worth ventured.
“Mmm,” said Falkner.
Reyes brought his printouts to the table. “With pepper?”
“That bag.” Falkner pointed. “You talked to Echeverria’s mother?”
“And the waiter at Stuben’s Deli.” Reyes pulled out one of the foot-long stuffed breads. Warm yeast smell made Lau’s mouth water.
“Echeverria went there to meet her ex,” Lau said. “It being about halfway and a public place, thus neutral ground. Not what you’d call an amicable divorce.”
Reyes snorted.
The door opened, and Brady stepped in. Lau felt her professional half-smile expand. “Hey, you.”
“Back atcha.” He lifted one of the metal folding chairs away from the table one-handed, spun it 180 degrees, and set it down. Then he straddled it, let it take his weight gradually, and folded his arms over the chair back.
Lau would bet he’d lost count of the metal folding chairs he’d killed.
Chaz slid through the door with a half-gallon jug of orange juice. “Coffee’s still brewing,” he sighed.
“Dinner,” Falkner said, pointing a thumb at the bags.
In Chaz’s face, the sun broke from behind a cloud.
“Talk while you eat,” Reyes ordered.
Lau handed the bags around. Chaz took two to start with. Brady, Lau knew, would eat two, but he’d wait on the second one to see what was left. She cut a pepper loaf in half for herself and carried it with her to the whiteboard.
“According to her mother,” she said, “Echeverria was meeting her ex-husband to discuss their daughter, and money, in that order. Specifically, increased child support, since the daughter had just been diagnosed with a heart ailment, and Echeverria’s insurance wouldn’t cover all the care.”
“Don’t tell me. Diagnosed at Holy Cross Medical Center,” Falkner said.
“Oh, good,” said Reyes, “it wasn’t just us. What have you got?”
Falkner nodded to Worth.
Worth swallowed fast and cleared her throat. “LaDona Benson’s son was diagnosed with asthma in early January, at Holy Cross. He went back to the ER there—” she fished her Palm out of her pocket to check, “—three days before Benson’s death.”
Lau started filling in Benson’s column on the whiteboard.
“Any signs that Benson was nervous or afraid?” asked Reyes.
Falkner shook her head. “Well-liked, happy, successful at work.”
“The waiter at the deli described Echeverria as nervous. She shredded her napkin, ordered a sandwich and picked it apart without eating it. Then she went to the women’s bathroom.”
“Where was the ex-husband?” Brady asked.
“In transit, with an alibi. He parked in a garage down the street, and the attendant remembers him.”
“Probably half a dozen panhandlers as well, if we could find the right ones,” Lau added. “Police pushed them off Hollywood and Sunset for the tourists, but they have to go somewhere. That seems to be one of the spots.”
“So, was she nervous about seeing her ex, or something else?” Falkner asked the air.
Lau raised one shoulder; the universal sign for No clue. “She was found in the stall with the door latched. Didn’t seem to have used the toilet, though.” Lau played that out in her head again. Into the restroom, and a stall...but then what? If you weren’t there to pee or shoot up—and there’d been no evidence of drugs—why stand around in a bathroom stall?
“Any idea how long she was in there?” Worth asked.
“Nope. The killer might have followed her. Or been there ahead of her.”
“Female, then?” Falkner stretched in her chair.
“Unless the gamma doesn’t require proximity to the victims,” Reyes said.
“Cookson also had a Holy Cross connection,” Brady said. “His girlfriend went to the ER there two days before he dropped dead at work. Chaz thinks she’s pregnant.”
Everyone looked at Chaz. He was most of the way through his third roll, and his mouth was full, but he nodded.
Lau noted the pregnancy on the whiteboard. Reyes frowned. “Hospital employee, or patient. We need the mechanism for the asphyxiations. Have we heard from Frost?”
Lau looked back over her shoulder, as if it were a casual gesture. “Worth? If she gets technical, you’ll at least have a chance of following the conversation.”
“Will do. Give me the number?”
Lau did, and watched Worth slip behind Brady and step into the hall with her phone.
Brady tucked his chin and frowned at Lau. She gave him back a shot of wide-eyed innocence. Brady sighed and turned to the whiteboard. “What about the kid connection?” he asked.
Lau shook her head. “Morro didn’t have kids. Gerianne Sussman didn’t, either.”
Chaz swallowed heroically. “Neither did Cookson, until we talked to his girlfriend.”
It took a moment to register. Lau was relieved to see that was true for everyone else, too.
Falkner pulled out her phone and pushed two buttons.
“About time you called,” Hafidha’s voice declared. “This place echoes like hell.”
“Hafidha, we’ve connected three victims to Holy Cross Hospital through the ER, via children or a pregnancy. Comb the records for Alonso Morro and Gerianne Sussman again, will you? Any connection to children admitted to the Holy Cross Emergency Department.”
“I was hoping for tough.”
“Best I’ve got.” Falkner looked serenely unamused. Lau thought she was amused, anyway.
“Hold the line?”
“Will do.”
Worth stepped back in from the hall and shook her head. “Dr. Frost’s voice mail.”
Lau avoided looking at Brady. “She won’t take long to call back.”
Reyes rubbed his eyes. “Even narrowing the vector down to the hospital, we still have thousands of suspects.”
Lau’s laptop chirped.
“Okay, gang,” Hafidha said through Falkner’s phone. “I’ve sent you files. Unfortunately, the Morros remain childless no matter what I do.”
“So much for the kid connection,” Brady grumbled.
“However,” Hafidha continued, and even on speaker Lau could hear the hello-not-done-yet inflection, “when Ms. Sussman remarried, she picked a widower, John Bianchi, with three kids. And lo, eleven-year-old Brian Bianchi was admitted to the Holy Cross emergency room with pneumonia. The day before Sussman died in the parking lot.” Hafidha sounded grim when she added, “He’s not doing well, by the way.”
Chaz froze with the jug of orange juice halfway to his mouth. “Did Sussman smoke?”
Reyes’s head swiveled. “What?”
“Benson did,” Worth said.
“So did Cookson.” Chaz leaned forward, eyes wide. “That’s why he was outside during working hours. Smoke break. That’s why they were all outdoors. No smoking indoors in California in public places. Not even bars.”
“Hang on,” Hafidha said. “First autopsy on Sussman... Tar and smoke particles in the lung tissue. Ruled out as cause of death. Still, smoker.”
Lau looked at the whiteboard again. “One case of asthma, one of pneumonia, and a heart problem...which could be secondhand-smoke related.”
“Sussman was at the hospital with her stepson—” Falkner said.
Chaz finished, “—and she went out for a cigarette.”
Brady nodded toward the board. “Echeverria wasn’t outdoors.”
Chaz shook his head hard enough to make his hair flop. “Tough neighborhood—street people, panhandlers. A woman by herself. And she was nervous, jittery—”
“Nicotine fit,” Worth burst out. Chaz shot her a grateful look. It was as if there were too many words in his throat, and he needed more people to help him say them. “She went to the bathroom for a smoke, because she didn’t feel safe outside.”
“That’s irony,” Lau growled. “So we’re looking for someone with a mad on for smokers?”
Reyes pursed his lips. “Breathing problems themselves?”
“The crack the anomaly got through,” Falkner said.
“The crack?” Worth said. She looked like a spectator at a tennis match.
“Stressors apply here, just as they do with other serial crimes.” Reyes sounded like a lecturer with sixty seconds before the end of class. “That could be the weakness that allowed the anomaly a foothold.”
“Like your immune system failing to protect you from a cold virus when you’re tired,” Lau added.
Hafidha’s voice broke in. “Holy Cross has a major pulmonary unit, compadres.”
“We’ll start there.” Reyes left his chair and swept his jacket off the back.

•

Like an emergency response crew, the team could go from settled to swift almost before Worth could register the change. Her heart rate bumped up as Reyes gave orders. “Chaz, Worth, I want you to interview Alonso Morro’s wife. Morro’s the only victim without a connection to the hospital. If you can find one, it’ll help us narrow this down.”
Chaz nodded. His face had gone stiff again; the intensity he’d had leaning across the table was burned out or boxed in.
“Worth, when Frost calls, phone the results to Lau. The rest of us will go to the hospital. Brady, Falkner, check with the staff for long-term patients with respiratory illnesses, dates of admission, and friends or relatives who visit regularly. Lau and I will hit Human Resources and study the staff.”
“Yell if you need me,” Gates said.
“Thank you, Hafidha.” Falkner disconnected.
Before Worth could say anything, the hospital-bound team were out the door, all but Lau. So to Lau, she said, “Good luck.”
Lau smiled. “Same to you.” And she was gone, too.
Chaz swallowed the last of his—fourth?—sandwich, chugged the dregs of the orange juice, and wiped his mouth and fingers with a napkin. “I’ll drive.”
“Good. I won’t feel guilty about answering the phone.” She watched him toss the napkin and pick up his backpack. His gaze stayed low, his chin tucked, his shoulders hunched. “Is it me?”
He raised his head sharply. “What?”
“Reyes paired us up on this interview, and you sort of...toggled off. I wondered if I’d done something.”
“Oh. No, it’s all good.” He smiled without showing the crooked front teeth.
It wasn’t all good, but if he didn’t want to talk there was nothing she could do. She stood up and slung her messenger bag over her shoulder.
The bakery bag was empty. Not too much food, after all.
Worth buttoned her suit jacket to cover her holster. Chaz, she noticed, hadn’t ever unbuttoned his. Well, he probably wouldn’t need to get at his gun without warning in a police station.
Probably.
Outside, the western sky was pinkish-orange with sunset and haze. The dark Crown Victoria was easy to find among the black-and-whites in the parking lot. Chaz unlocked the doors with his whole attention. Then he said, “It really isn’t you.”
“It’s okay. I mean, if it’s not me, it’s none of my business, right?”
Chaz got behind the wheel, so she did, too. It’s Los Angeles, Worth thought. All significant conversations happen in and around cars.
He made a long, flat line of his mouth. “It’s not that it’s not your business.” He frowned ferociously out the windshield and found the ignition by feel. “It’s just—they’re on their way to the place voted most likely to harbor a gamma.” The engine caught with a roar; he gave the gas an extra jab before he put it in gear and the acceleration bounced Worth backwards. “And Reyes sends us to interview the victim’s wife.”
Worth hadn’t thought of it that way. It embarrassed her that she hadn’t. “You crave a life of danger?”
The tires squealed a little as he turned onto the street. “Isn’t that what we’re supposed to have?”
For the last year, he’d been on a desk. Brady doubted him, Worth knew. Brady wouldn’t have said so, but Chaz would spot it, and know Brady wouldn’t be the only one. She couldn’t think of anything to say that she’d want to hear in his place.
He turned, drove another block, and said, “Every time they go out, they take a risk. It’s not right that I don’t. I can’t sit back and not do the job, when they do it every day.”
She remembered what she’d heard outside the briefing room, between Reyes and Falkner. What was right, and what was fair. Even Reyes doubted. Chaz would know that, too. “You’re doing the job.”
And so was she. Wasn’t she? He was right: Reyes had sent the new kids out of the line of fire. They had training and useful skills and on-paper rank, but they weren’t part of the pack.
He shrugged and jounced them over a speed bump. “Yeah. Like I said. It’s all good.”
She could leave it there, let him banish the subject. Maybe he was done with it. But she wasn’t. “I— Look, I’m sorry if this is a terrible thing to say, but I’m glad I’m not alone. Except I am, because they know you. I don’t have any history here. But at least I don’t have to be the only new face at the party.”
He gave her a slanting, sideways look.
Way to rub it in, Daphne. “God, it was a terrible thing to say. Never mind. I just—”
“You’re serious.” His voice said, You’re not serious.
“What?”
“You came in from Down the Hall. Nobody’s going to think you’re not qualified. When Reyes left us behind, I figured you were assigned babysitting duty.”
“Tell that to SSA Brady.”
“Brady gave you the man-enough routine?” Chaz startled her by grinning. “Jesus. Nothing short of a one-handed pushup will win that guy’s love.”
“Can you do one? We could try it and see.” She squeezed down the bubble of panicky laughter the picture produced. Maybe in the aisle next to Brady’s desk.
“Hah. Competing for favor is beneath me.” He took the inside line on a corner without regard for lanes. But it was a residential street, and quiet.
“Does that mean you can’t?”
He narrowed his eyes. “Show me yours first.”
She smiled at him. It felt good. It felt like the first actual unconsidered smile she’d worn in days.
They found the Morro house, a little stuccoed Cape Cod, and Chaz rang the bell. Worth heard something inside, at the back of the house. They waited, looked at each other, and Chaz rang again.
After a moment Worth heard light, running steps. Someone struggled with the knob from inside. And a little girl opened the door.
She was maybe eight, with big dark eyes in a sandy-brown face with wide, flat Indio cheekbones. She wore red cropped pants and a candycane-striped ruffled top. She stared up in silence at Chaz as if he were a national monument.
Chaz stared back, startled, the color fading out of his face.
“Adelita!” a woman called from inside. “¿Quien es, gatita?”
“Un hombre y una mujér,” the girl said, as if that explained everything. She ran back down the dark hall into the house.
“Are you okay?” Worth asked Chaz.
“Yeah.” he blinked. “Fine.”
A tall, deep-bosomed Hispanic woman came down the hall. Adelita followed. “¿Sí?”
“Mrs. Morro?” Worth said. “I’m Special Agent Worth, from the FBI. We’re following up on the death of your husband—”
“This isn’t your daughter,” Chaz blurted.
“No. She’s my niece, Alonso’s sister’s little one.” Mrs. Morro frowned, with her eyebrows and mouth at once. “Her mama is in drug rehab. We’re...I’m looking after her.” She looked back over her shoulder and dropped her voice. “For all I care, she don’t ever have to come out.”
Chaz rocked back a little. “Your niece has been seen at Holy Cross Medical Center?”
Mrs. Morro gave him a narrow-eyed stare. “She’s not an illegal. She’s entitled to treatment.”
“Yes, ma’am.”
“Was it a respiratory illness?” Worth asked.
“Bronchitis. She gets it bad.”
“Did—was it your husband who took her to the ER?”
Morro’s frown was less warning and more alarmed now. “Yeah. I met him there, then I stayed with Adela while he took the bus...took the bus to work. Only—” She pressed her lips tight and threw her head back, and her body swelled with her breathing.
“It’s all right,” Worth said, trying not to sound too gentle. Too gentle made it hurt more. “Mrs. Morro, did your husband smoke?”
Morro looked at Worth as if she could see the simpler past through the outline of her body. “Yes, he did.”
Worth met Chaz’s eyes. Smokers and kids, she thought. Five for five.
“Mrs. Morro, thank you for your time. That’s all we need.” Worth stepped off the porch and headed for the car with Chaz close behind. Open a wound and walk away—but they had to do it. They just didn’t have to feel good about it.
Worth’s phone buzzed halfway to the car. She flipped it open.
“Frost,” said the level female voice, the one on the voice mailbox.
“Hi! This is Daph—”
“I know. You left your name and number.”
It was hard to tell if Frost was annoyed, or rushed, or just stating the obvious: her voice held no emotion. “Thank you for—”
“Do you still want the results of my autopsy on the victim?”
“I— Yes?”
“The interior of the subject’s airway shows no tissue damage that might have been caused by a foreign object. The original autopsy was unclear on that; it stated that there was no object present, but didn’t mention whether one might have been introduced and removed post mortem.”
That had the kind of obsessive thoroughness Worth was used to in pathologists. “But that means—”
“Nothing at all, Agent Worth. It’s merely the absence of evidence.”
“I guess— No, ma’am. Doctor.”
“I found multiple microscopic tears in the muscle of the tongue, however.”
Tears in muscle tissue, like the tiny tears that opened in the muscles of bodybuilders straining against a weight. “She strangled on her own tongue while conscious?”
A moment of silence on the phone. “More significantly, she struggled against strangling on her own tongue.”
“Mechanical blockage of the airway. With her tongue. The gamma controlled the muscle itself?”
“That appears to be the case.” For the first time, Worth heard emotion in Dr. Frost’s voice: a chilly, distant disapproval. “Control of the autonomic nervous system through the brain stem would have been more direct and efficient. The best way to cause asphyxiation is to turn off the involuntary impulse to breathe.”
Worth shivered. That would be the best way. A gamma who did that would leave no evidence for the police or the pathologist. Just a trail of people who stopped breathing. Don’t give them any ideas. “But there would have been less struggling?”
“Done properly, there would be none at all.”
The tone with which Frost said “properly” was alarming.
“But that would assume the person responsible knew the neurophysiology of respiration,” Frost continued.
“Wait—so someone with a background in respiratory physiology—a doctor, a nurse, an LPN—would have just gone to the source? But a mechanical cause... That could be someone with practical experience but less training. Unless it’s someone with a lot of training who wants it to look—”
“My area of expertise is pathology, Agent Worth. The psychology is your responsibility.”
There was such a lack of emotion in those two sentences that Worth thought she might get hypothermia just from listening. “Yes, ma’am. No.”
“Do you have any other questions for me?”
“No. No, ma’am.”
“Good. Good-bye, Agent Worth.”
And the connection was silent.
Worth leaned on the car to catch her breath. Across the hood Chaz watched, head canted, eyebrows raised, wearing the long, flat grin that exaggerated his chin.
“What?” Worth said.
“I’ll tell Lau you survived your initiation.”
“Wha— Son of a bitch, that was on purpose?”
“You’d have to talk to her sooner or later.”
“Jesus!” She recalled the flat, steady voice on the phone and shook herself like a wet dog to break the spell. “So...does she look like that?”
“Oh, no. Cozy. Like a vampire nursery school teacher.”
“Gah.”
“Get in. You can phone Lau with the report while I get us to Burbank.”
Act V
Falkner winced as the big purple Ford plunged into the Emergency Department parking area and stopped like a cow pony. Chaz swung out the driver’s side: long skinny feet, quarter mile of legs, brown hair falling across his sallow face and brushing his gapping shirt collar, elbows jutting like compasses.
A moment later Worth pulled herself up out of the passenger seat and leaned on the roof. “Chaz, I used to drive an ambulance,” she said, with the threat of a squeak in the last word.
Chaz smiled and blinked like a happy cat. “So?”
“I didn’t drive it like that.”
“Oh, come on. If the car ahead of you in the next lane is doing 68 miles an hour, and the car behind him is doing 75, and you’re doing 71, and a Ford Crown Victoria is 212 inches bumper to bumper, you can figure out how much room you need to change lanes in.”
“Gah. What do you factor in for the heart attacks of the other two drivers?”
Chaz snorted that one away and loped up the ramp to Falkner. “Lau got Daphne’s call?”
Falkner noted the name without comment. “The one with the panicky indrawn breaths?”
Chaz frowned. “I didn’t run into anything, and nothing ran into us.”
“That,” Falkner sighed, “is not necessarily the point of the exercise.”
Worth arrived at his shoulder. “But do we have a profile?”
“Certified nurse’s assistant or nursing student under supervision, working in pediatric ER, may have a respiratory illness or have lost a child or young relative to a respiratory disorder, or both. Has probably spoken out against smokers, especially parents who smoke, and has quarreled with coworkers who smoke. Impatient, argues with nursing directives, doesn’t take criticism well. He—or she—is supremely confident in his own judgment, and justifies what he or she does in terms of removing children from life-threatening situations.” She heard Reyes’s phrasings coming out her mouth. Well, why not? He led this team for a reason.
“She thinks she’s a persecuted hero,” Worth said.
“It could be a man.”
“Depends on how close the gamma has to be to make the trick work,” said Chaz.
Falkner heard the rare confidence in his voice. He’d forgotten himself in the puzzle. “How so?”
“Parking lots are classic danger zones for women alone. LaDona Benson and Gerianne Sussman died next to their cars. If a strange male had approached, they’d have bolted.”
“But a woman could have walked right up to them,” Worth finished. “Plus, there’s Cristina Echeverria in the women’s bathroom.”
Falkner looked from Chaz’s face to Worth’s, wildly different, matched in the flush of excitement. Cool them off. They’re too wired up to be careful. But they were right. They’d filled in the pieces of the profile. And they needed to prove themselves. “We’re interviewing staff in the ER and in Pediatrics and in the pulmonary department. But we’re keeping a low profile. If the gamma knows we’re close, he—she—may bolt. Be very damned careful, and if you flush our bird, use your heads. They’re what you were hired for.”
Worth looked solemn, but Falkner caught the pinch at the corners of Chaz’s mouth that constrained a smile. She couldn’t lecture him in front of the new hire. And she couldn’t ask the new hire to look out for him, either. He’ll take it seriously when it counts, Falkner told herself. And, You can’t sit on them like a hen on eggs.

•

At least they didn’t look like FBI. Worth hadn’t thought of it as an advantage. She supposed she might look authoritative enough to be from the Health Department. Chaz looked like a med student interviewing for a summer job.
Worth walked through ER admitting briskly, and hoped Chaz, behind her, was doing the same. “We have a plan?” he murmured over her shoulder.
“Everyone else is interviewing supervisory staff, because they may have noticed things. We’re going to talk to the rank and file.”
“Because nobody gossips to the boss.” He sounded pleased. “We need a cover story if we’re not going to spook the gamma.”
They were out of sight of the front desk, so Worth stopped and hugged the wall to let an orderly with a cart pass. “Human Resources?”
“Independent health management consulting service hired by Human Resources to study workplace environment and compliance with non-discrimination policies.” He said it on a single exhale, without pausing to consider.
Worth nodded. “You’re a genius.”
He shrugged and grinned. “I’m good at plausible deniability.”
Worth resolved to ask later what he’d practiced on.
“You interview, I’ll watch,” he added.
“Watch for what?”
“For ’which of these things is not like the others.’ It’s sort of my superpower. Lame, but true.”
“Right now, it beats flying.”
They collared nursing assistants one by one, whenever they seemed to be between duties. Worth assured them of confidentiality, and asked about the job, about their coworkers: was anyone hard to get along with? Critical? Intolerant?
Chaz pretended to take notes on Worth’s Palm. Because she knew he was doing it, she could feel his attention shift, settle, shift again.
It was slow going, through the crowded emergency department. Because of interviewing Benson, Worth noticed smells: the black-haired nurse who wore too much perfume, the volunteer with blonde streaks and hairspray. The hospital itself smelled like floor wax, antibacterial soap, the old-yeast smell of the dispensary. She couldn’t explain the occasional whiff of nail polish remover.
Whenever she glanced up she expected to see someone she knew. Wrong city, wrong time. But two paramedics in dark navy hurried by with a gurney, and she looked, even though she knew better.
“Ghosts,” she muttered to Chaz, and laughed, and realized he had no idea what she meant. He nodded, but his attention was fixed on the hallways, sharp as a hunting animal.
The entire staff below the level of LPN seemed to have complaints about their supervisors or each other. Worth listened, waiting. Someone would say it, or would complain about a staff member saying it: no one here is competent. No one is intelligent. Only me. I know what’s right.
They turned the corner into an older wing of the hospital. Narrow corridors, more traffic—nurses, doctors, patients, visitors, a maintenance guy replacing a ceiling fluorescent fixture. Worth flagged down a skinny Asian nurse’s assistant with blue eyeliner and a blue flowered scrub tunic. “Excuse me,” she said, trying hard for Falkner’s “trust me” voice. “Do you have time to answer a few questions?”
The Asian woman’s ID read, “Janet Miyaki.” “Lady, I got time for a cup of coffee. And my mom said don’t talk with your mouth full.” She started to push past Worth and Chaz.
Another woman, a nurse if Worth read the accessories right, hurried toward them. “Janet, they need you to monitor the Bianchi boy.” She looked past Miyaki to Worth and Chaz, and seemed to register their civilian status for the first time. “Sorry.”
Cigarette smoke. One of these women was a smoker.
“Break,” Miyaki said. “Union rules. No can do.” She nodded toward an exit sign, fumbling in her tunic pocket. The nurse muttered something that sounded politically incorrect and hurried off down the hall.
Miyaki frowned. Then her mouth opened, wide, wider, a soundless scream with no air. Her hands flailed at her throat and mouth.
“Chaz, she’s here. Airway!” Worth yelled. She yanked Miyaki close, swatted her hands away from her face. In the woman’s straining mouth, she could see the tongue pulled back, flexed, saliva pooling in the space behind her bottom front teeth.
Worth stuck her knuckles between Miyaki’s back molars, just in case, and grabbed at her tongue with thumb and forefinger. It was slick and strong and she couldn’t grip it. Mikaki’s front teeth scraped her fingers.
They’d used a square of gauze for this, to get friction. No gauze. No supply cart. No god-damned help—
“Shit. Sorry,” she said to Miyaki, yanked the sleeve of her jacket down, folded the hem over her fingertips, pinched down on the woman’s tongue, and pulled.
The cloth gave her more purchase. A screech of air dragged into Miyaki’s throat before Worth lost her grip. “Gauze and a fucking airway over here, now!” Worth screamed.
“Got her,” said Chaz, in a voice so low and fierce she almost didn’t recognize it.
For an instant Worth couldn’t remember what that meant. He stood stiff as a pointing dog, as a cat watching motion in the grass, and his gaze fixed on a woman with short brown hair in a bright print scrub top who stood at the end of the crowded hall. The print was of kids sailing hot-air balloons. The skin of her face was slack over the bones. She watched Miyaki with a fixed and unalarmed stillness.
Two people in white armed with gloves and gauze and an NPA finally, finally shouldered Worth aside and pounced on Miyaki.
The brown-haired woman—the gamma—raised her eyes from Miyaki and saw Chaz. She turned and bolted back down the hall. Chaz plunged after her.
“Shit. Chaz!”
The gamma body-checked a swinging door and banged through. Chaz dodged the maintenance man’s ladder and an inattentive resident with a clipboard and disappeared after her.
Worth jabbed numbers on her phone. Turn off cellphones and pagers in hospital. She apologized mentally to any patients whose life support she was reprogramming.
“Lau,” said the voice in her ear.
“We’ve got her. Five foot nine-ish, short brown hair, bright print scrub top, face looks like she’s lost weight recently. East wing, other side of the Emergency Department—going through a door labeled A-17. Hall stripes are blue and green. Chaz is pursuing. Send backup.” She slapped her phone closed and slammed through the doors.
Chaz, unmistakably, disappearing around a corner ahead, his gun out and low. She could smell, under the antiseptic, a clean dampness, salt, and a little nail polish remover.
It was the physical therapy wing. Worth drew her own weapon as she bolted past a treadmill, a passive-motion machine, and a rack of rainbow-colored hand weights.
She rounded the corner and saw Chaz, and the door ahead of him closing slowly on its hydraulic hinge. He hit it with his shoulder to smack it open.
A swift arc of motion beyond the door, of something primary-blue. It ended at Chaz’s head with a shocking thump, and he fell and rolled and disappeared with a splash.
Worth hurtled through the doors, prepared to dodge.
The smell was salt water. In the middle of a green-tiled room, the water in a therapy pool rocked and smashed over the sides from the force of Chaz going under. The hard-surfaced walls echoed back the sound of the blow, the splash, the noise of the blue ten-pound hand weight hitting the wet cement floor.
Chaz’s head broke the surface of the pool, and the brown-haired woman knelt and shoved it back under.
“FBI!” Worth yelled, sighting down her Glock. “Let him go!”
And felt her tongue close the back of her throat.
Panic. She’d learned not to panic. She hadn’t learned not to breathe. On her knees on the cold cement, her brain screaming We’re going to die!
Instinct said drop her gun. Use her hands to tear her throat clear. She fought to raise the Glock. Her arms were weak, shaking. She scrambled her jacket sleeve over the skittering fingers of one hand and tried to grip her tongue. The jacket fabric pulled away as her arm bent, goddamn it, use both hands. She shoved the gun behind her across the floor. But her vision speckled with black—
A rush of water, over the roaring in her ears. She could breathe again. Chaz was out of the pool and struggling with the gamma, who was too strong for a woman that size.
Chaz’s gun was in the pool. Hers was somewhere behind her. Chaz was in her line of fire.
She scrambled for her gun anyway. And her throat closed again.
The gamma had pinned Chaz from behind, above the elbows. Blood ran down over the right side of his face from somewhere in his hair, from that first blow. He snapped his head backward, but he was too tall to head-butt the woman. She would strangle Worth, then Chaz.
His elbows were pinned almost behind his back. But he stretched his left forearm hard, fingers reaching, clawing, to draw something from a second holster on his belt.
She realized what it was a moment before he used it. No part of the gamma was within his reach. So he fired the taser charge into his own wet body.
The crack was like a giant bone breaking. The smell was ozone and scorching cloth and skin. The two figures joined in a horrible spasmed curve and flash; then they separated and fell, Chaz to one side, the gamma almost in the pool.
She could breathe.
She didn’t bother to stand up; she scrambled across the floor to Chaz. She rolled him on his back, tipped his head to clear his airway, and crossed her hands over his chest.
The gamma raised her head, groggy, glaring. Worth felt her tongue crawl back in her mouth.
Worth launched herself at the gamma, hit her high in the chest and knocked her backward onto the lip of the pool. She slammed the heel of her hand under the gamma’s chin, held her head back and down into the water, and put all her weight on it.
All her weight against the muscles in the woman’s neck. She saw them cord. They shouldn’t be strong enough to push her back. It wasn’t right.
Through the threshing water the woman’s brown hair waved like fishes’ fins. Her eyes glared up at Worth, desperate and fixed.
A gamma was hard to kill. Like the hopped-up robber the police had gunned down, that Worth and Vin and Josh had loaded into the ambulance, no heartbeat, no breath sounds. Who’d sat up and killed them anyway.
She could have saved them. She could have been faster. If she’d known. But by the time she put the defib paddles to the monster’s temples, it was too late.
How long, to drown a gamma?
Chaz lay still on the cold floor, his chest motionless. He was cyanotic. He was dying. How long since the taser? How long before the thing under her gave up and drowned?
The woman’s eyes pinched tight. Her chest heaved and heaved, and her neck went limp.
Worth gave a last desperate shove to push her further under and scrambled across the wet tiles to Chaz.
Compressions—one hundred per minute. The timing was as natural as her own breathing. Just move the blood around. They were in a hospital, for God’s sake, they could save him.
Her tongue closed her throat again.
She didn’t look up. Elbows locked, she could keep up the rhythm for a long time before she suffocated, it was just a matter of rocking forward...
“FBI,” said someone very far away. It was followed by the shattering noise of a gun firing in a closed, hard room, over and over.
She could breathe. She hadn’t lost count. Brady crouched across Chaz’s body. His lips moved, but she couldn’t hear him; was she going unconscious? No, the gunshots.
“He needs defib,” she said, knowing she was shouting. Brady bolted. She kept rocking in rhythm.
Eventually the hospital team took over. They had to drag her off him, because she didn’t notice when they came in. She slumped on the concrete while they took care of Chaz. She wasn’t certain about the details of that part, but that was all right; she’d seen it done before, when she was clear-headed.
Then they were gone, and she was still sitting on the wet floor. Brady was cross-legged in front of her. “What happened?” he said, and she realized she could hear again.
“He had to taser himself to get to the gamma.” She sounded as affectless as Dr. Frost.
“Where were you?”
“Being strangled.” Did he blame her for this?
“Which one of those is your gun?” Brady nodded at the pool, and at the end of the room where the Glock had skidded against the wall.
“The one on the floor.”
“It should have been in your hand.” His voice was tight and thin. “And you should have pulled the trigger until it went click, click, click.”
Well, at least she wasn’t numb anymore. “Easy for you to say.”
Brady leaned forward, and everything about his perfect face was hard. “Easy for me to do. It had better get easy for you, too. You’ll hear a lot of shit from Reyes about how we don’t learn from dead gammas. But they’re monsters. If there’s anything left of the person they were, you can assume it would rather be dead.” His voice cracked, and he drew air in through his teeth. “Once one of ’em comes at you, you fire your weapon until the magazine is empty, and if you have to, slap another one in. Anything else is suicide. Or, worse case, murder.”
Worth folded her arms over her stomach. She was starting to shake. “Is he going to be okay?”
“I don’t know.” He seemed to reconsider that. “They had his heart started by the time they got to the hall, so that’s a good sign. He’s tough.” He stood up and held out a hand.
There were cops and CSI beside the pool. She hadn’t noticed them past his body, and the intensity of his presence. The water in the pool was tinted red.
She let him pull her to her feet. There was no hiding the shaking, really. It was normal, but she was ashamed of it anyway.
He took off his jacket, wrapped it around her, and left his arm around her shoulders. “Come on. Let’s go hear the prognosis.”

•

Cora Marie Pace, 40, had watched her husband die of lung cancer. Six months later, her eleven-year-old daughter was diagnosed with emphysema. No one had diagnosed Pace’s contact with the anomaly. Falkner wondered if it had whispered to her, a voice on her shoulder, or if it had seemed only a series of natural conclusions, one growing out of another. Until she was moved to murder, and had the power to do it.
Brian Bianchi, whose new stepmother Pace had killed, was winning his battle with pneumonia.
The medical examiner who’d first asked for the team got Frost’s autopsy, and as much of the facts as was reasonable.
“Enlightenment, one file cabinet at a time,” Reyes grumbled as he dropped into his seat on the plane.
“That’s one more than you had last week.” Falkner shoved her carryon under her seat with her foot and turned to study the rest of the team. “Once we’re in the air, take the couch,” she ordered Chaz.
“I’m fine,” Chaz growled. The Steri-strip at his hairline contrasted nicely with his grayish-pale face.
“Did I end that with a question mark?”
He bit his lip. He wouldn’t fall over, anyway; the rest of the kids had him stuffed up against the window again, with Brady on the aisle. This time Worth was sitting across from him, where she could watch for signs of distress. Falkner wondered if Chaz knew that.
And having to watch Chaz—or feeling she had to—gave Worth something to center on. There was some internal wobble in Worth, Falkner was certain. Well, if she needed to, she’d step in.
Lau had made sure there was food in the galley’s mini-fridge and cupboards, and had restocked the coffee. Falkner checked them again, because she had to do something, and nothing needed doing. In about twenty-four hours her body would realize the job was done, the emergency was over, and she could let go. But her internal spring was slow to unwind.
Besides, from this vantage point she could examine Brady. She assumed he knew she was doing it. Brady would understand that, no matter how justified the shoot, his bosses would watch for how he took it. The requisite administrative leave was purely paperwork. It had nothing to do with psychology.
Behind her, Worth said, outraged, “Your eyes are two different colors!”
“It’s called heterochromia.” Chaz was still grumbling.
“Do you realize I’ve been sitting here worrying that you’re concussed, and all the time it’s just that you’re weird?”
Falkner held her breath; that wasn’t the sort of thing just anyone could say to Chaz.
But he snorted. “Ow. Don’t make me laugh. Ow.”
“You just noticed that?” That was Lau.
Worth protested, “The light has to be right.”
“And you have to be staring at me,” said Chaz. “Which you’re too shy to do.”
“Am not!”
“Ow again.”
“That’s blackmail,” Lau observed. She made it sound like a feature.
“He’s got sheepdog eyes,” said Brady blandly. “Like a blue heeler. Man, they’re great dogs. I had one when I was a kid.”
“Brady,” Chaz said, “are you saying I’m a dog?”
“I’m saying you’re a great dog. Loyal, smart, hard-working, eat you out of house and home—”
“Ow ow ow ow.”
“Suck it up, kid.”
The seat belt light came on. Falkner straightened and turned back toward her place. As she did, Brady looked up and caught her eye. She gave him half a smile, on the side where the others couldn’t see, and went to buckle in.
By the time they reached altitude, Chaz was too tired to fight against the couch. Brady took one of the solo seats up front, and Lau the other; they reclined them and went to sleep on either side of the aisle, Lau curled like a kitten, Brady with his jacket pulled over his head.
Nobody ever slept on the way out. They’d learned to sleep on the way back, though. You slept when you got the chance; it was like the Army in that respect, at least.
Worth was awake, looking out the window at nothing.
Falkner stood up—the stretching was only partly pretext—and went back to sit across from her. She kept her voice down when she asked, “You okay?”
“Yeah.” Worth scrubbed at her face with both hands and murmured, “But I could have not been.”
“Any landing you walk away from.”
“No, I don’t mean me. I— If I were going home and he weren’t...” She looked across the aisle to the couch and Falkner followed her gaze. Chaz had pulled the blanket to his chin in his sleep, and his feet showed at the other end, vulnerable and foolish in brown wool socks.
“That could happen. It doesn’t happen often, thank God. The Bureau is not in the habit of losing expensive field agents. But it’s not impossible.”
“It came pretty close this time.”
“He’s tougher than he looks.” Falkner didn’t say, It’s one of the anomaly’s gifts.
Worth looked down, and her bangs slid to hide her eyes. She was worrying the adhesive bandage on her scraped fingers.
“Worth.”
Worth looked up.
“’Competent’ is not an insult,” Falkner said.
Worth looked blank for an instant; then she flushed. “No, ma’am.”
Falkner stood up. “Get some sleep. Or you’ll be amazed how rotten you feel by the time you get home.”

•

Everything looked different: the hall, the bullpen, the color of the walls. The monitors in the computer room changed all the time, but the context of the room seemed altered. Worth knew it wasn’t true. She was different. If this had happened when she worked Down the Hall, she didn’t remember it.
It was early, and quiet. Brady would be out until the inquiry was over, and Chaz was taking a sick day. Reyes’ office was dark. Todd and Lau were nowhere in sight. There was light beyond Falkner’s door.
“Boo,” said a voice behind her.
It was Gates. “Sorry,” said Worth, and got out of the doorway.
“What for?”
“Being in your way?”
This morning Gates’s hair was doing something complex and knotted on the back of her head, and her glasses were cat’s-eye shaped and blue. “Peaches, if you’re in my way, I’ll probably say something like, oh, ’Excuse me, you’re in my way.’ Now, come into my lair and let me give you chocolate.”
“It— Why?”
“Ordinarily, I would tell you to never look gift chocolate in the motivation. But in fact, I have a reason.” Gates sat down at her desk, pivoted the chair to face Worth, and said, “Chaz is my totally-unrelated-by-blood little brother. You saved his life. I owe you chocolate.”
“I didn’t really—”
Gates spun, tapped a monitor, and spun back. “I have the initial case reports and the hospital records. Sweetie, you’re trying to bullshit the Oracle at Delphi.” She leaned sideways, stretched out an arm, and snagged a box with the Jacques Torres logo on the lid. “Bring this back when it’s empty.”
Worth wanted to stick her hands in her pockets. “That’s not why I did it.”
“I know. That’s just one more reason why I love you and want you to have chocolate.” Gates sighed. “The blood is draining from my arm.”
Worth took the box, opened it, and held it out. “You start.”
Gates grinned. “I knew you were a right ’un.” She plucked a truffle. “Also, in case it comes up, call me Hafidha. Even His Eminence only calls me ’Agent Gates’ when he’s extra-peevish.”
“If I say, ’Call me Daphne,’ do I get more Scooby jokes?”
“Probably. But only with respect and affection.”
“That’s okay, then. Um, wander by at regular intervals and help me eat these, okay?” Worth started for the bullpen.
“Daphne? Did I actually say ’thank you?’ Thank you.”
Worth looked back over her shoulder. “Any time,” she replied, and meant it.

Learn to Swim

FBI Headquarters, J. Edgar Hoover Building, Washington, D.C., December, 2005
“Can you swim?” Brady asked.
“Of course I can swim.” Chaz considered leaving it at that, and decided against it. “I grew up in Las Vegas, one of the private pool capitals of the world. Not teaching Vegas kids to swim is equivalent to drowning them.”
“Who taught you?”
Chaz shrugged. “YMCA.” It was the Cepaks who’d thought kids should learn to swim. All their fosters got swimming lessons. He’d been miserable until he understood the mechanics and made them work. But he’d been determined to make them work, because drowning was a dumb way to die. And whoever heard of a hero who couldn’t swim?
That was back in the days when he planned to learn to ride a horse, because you never knew when you might need to steal a horse and ride across the desert at night to escape your enemies. Before he got a chance at that, he’d realized that learning to drive would be better insurance than learning to ride a horse. So he learned to drive as soon as he could reach the pedals.
And that was the end of that foster home.
He wondered if he’d have been better off or worse if Nevada had had a state orphanage system. More stable, in some ways. But it would have been a lot harder to get hold of the car keys.

WTF BBQ

Woodbridge, VA, Memorial Day, 2007

Daphne Worth hadn’t meant to be the first one at the cookout, either. But she’d said she’d pick up the drinks, and she’d been scared to death of getting lost, being late, or just plain being abducted by aliens between the condo door and Brady’s white, picture-window, ranch-style house in the south suburbs. So when she pulled up it was obvious she was early; the curb beside the neatly-edged strip of lawn was barren of other vehicles and the front door of the house was tight shut.
Daphne turned the engine off but left the keys in the ignition. For a moment she sat with her hands on the wheel, considering pulling back out and driving around the block a couple of times. But as her hand was dropping to the key, Brady’s door swung open and he filled up the aperture. Busted by a man who keeps a nice lawn, she thought. He was a quiet type. Kept to himself.
He strode down the brick walk, sunlight catching highlights off his thick sandy hair, and let the screen door bang. “Worth! Need a hand with anything?”
“Got a wheelbarrow?” She pasted the smile to her face—it got easier with practice—and popped the trunk. Two cases of beer, two bags of soda, a case of Deer Park spring water. Chips, onion dip, hamburger buns. “It’s just drinks. I don’t cook. From each according to his ability, right?”
“Beer is never wrong at a barbecue,” he said.
“Chaz said to bring sliced Italian bread, too.” She grabbed the bag off the passenger seat, swinging it across the center of the car as she stood up. “How much are we planning on eating?”
“Chaz and Hafidha are coming.” He stacked the beer and water so he could pick up all three cases at once, and still had a hand free for the trunk when he was done. She followed him up the walk, her arms full of paper bags, and as he held the screen door for her he said, “It’s pretty much impossible to bring too much food.”
When she glanced at him to see if it was a joke, he winked. The bags crinkled as her arms tightened in surprise.
“Exhale,” Brady said. “We’re not that scary.”
“New kid. First company party. You know.”
“Yeah.”
She heard him lock the screen door behind them, but he left the inside door standing wide. Open for business.
Whatever she’d expected from Special Agent Danny Brady’s private castle, the living room confirmed it. Steel gray carpet, gas fire closed down for the summer, royal blue leather couch, loveseat, and recliner. Glass-topped coffee table, and a high-definition television big as an army cot. The house was open-plan, living room divided from the dining room by a glass brick wall, light shining in through foundation plantings outside the window on the east. She wondered if he had a maid service.
“I didn’t picture you as a glass brick kind of guy,” she said, as he slid the beverages onto the breakfast island and walked around it to pop the fridge. Daphne was no expert, but it was a serious-looking kitchen: stainless appliances, double sink under a broad window open on the back yard.
She heard a motor running in the street, the put-putter of an aged four-cylinder.
“Built in the seventies,” he said dismissively. “That’s Chaz. I recognize the car. You want to get the door for him while I put this beer where it will do the most good?”
“In your belly?” Daphne asked, her pulse jumping as if she had said something greatly daring. She set her bags on the table and dove for the door before Brady could answer.
When she reached it, she burst into startled laughter. Because there was Chaz Villette unfolding his Jacob’s-ladder body from the driver’s seat of a baby-blue ragtop 1977 Volkswagen Beetle with Bondo-spotted fenders, his leather backpack slung off his left shoulder.
He looked up when he heard her, and she did a doubletake. In less than seventy-two hours he’d been transformed: the sallow complexion she’d apologetically thought of as bloodless replaced by a burnished and distinctly non-Caucasian bronze. If she found him unconscious in her ambulance now, she’d be reporting him as male, mid-twenties, and Latino, and worrying about making sure there was a Spanish-speaker handy when he woke up, just in case.
As she blinked at him, cheeks numb with a poleaxed expression, he pushed sunglasses up a browned Andalusian nose she now realized might have been inherited from some unknown Conquistador. But then he ducked his chin apologetically, awkwardly, and was suddenly just Chaz again. “Chick magnet?” he offered with a nod at the car, light voice scratching uncertainly.
She had recovered herself enough to laugh again. She stepped out the door as he walked around to the front of the Bug and grabbed the formerly chrome-plated latch. She said, “Worked for Ted Bundy.”
“Mine’s got both seats.” He started stacking Styrofoam coolers on the curb. “Careful” —as she went to lift the first couple— “that’s hot.”
“It’s a cooler.”
“Insulation is insulation.” He shrugged, a gesture that always seemed to be about making defensive spikes out of his collarbones. “This one has ice and meat in it,” he said. “And this one’s ceviche. Are you sure...?”
“Got it,” she said, lifting. The coolers weren’t that heavy. Heavy enough, but not exactly a 175-pound rescue dummy. “Honest.” She looked up as Lau’s little red toppered pickup glided up at the curb. “Oh, look, here’s Hafidha and Nikki. Hafs, could you—”
“In a heartbeat,” Hafidha Gates said. She somehow managed to climb gracefully from the cab, despite platform sandals and a sweeping floral skirt and two Tupperware cake carriers stacked in her hands. She tossed beaded braids over her shoulder and shook them, as if the rattle pleased her. “Nikki, get the bag in the back?”
Nikki Lau was already bent over, rummaging behind the seats, shoving the razor-cut layers of her hair irritably behind one ear. “I brought wine coolers and guacamole,” she said, as Daphne tried not to stare awestruck at the fit of her faded jeans. “This California girl knows better than to go mano a mano with real cooks. Is that yours, Daphs?”
“Um.” She rested her chin on the topmost of the two coolers, foam denting under her fingers. “This is all Chaz. I don’t cook—”
“Thank God,” Lau said. Laden with bags and keys, she hip-checked the door and chirped the lock. “I thought I was the only one.”
Her grin showed white, perfect teeth, and Daphne felt the tightness in her chest—of which she hadn’t even been aware—ease.

•

The beers Brady shoved into the freezer had cooled enough to drink, so he pulled out a Coors and two Sam Adams and cracked each in turn with the blue-handled church key.
Behind him, Chaz had dropped his backpack on one of the saddle-topped barstools and was rummaging through it. Brady set one of the Sams down on the island for Chaz and stretched across to hand the other to Worth.
“Thanks,” she said, pushing her bangs out of her eyes with the back of her other hand. She drank from the bottle, eyes closing. “Wow, that’s good.”
Chaz laid a black nylon package on the island and unrolled it, revealing three black-handled knives—paring, chef’s, and long-bladed filet.
“You know,” Brady said, “I have knives.”
Chaz grinned at him sideways from under tumbled hair. “You think so, do you?”
Brady rolled his eyes and reached for his beer, breaking eye contact. “Huh.”
“Do you have a cutting board?”
Brady craned an arm to retrieve the tempered glass board from beside the fridge, and laid it down beside Chaz on the side opposite the beer.
Chaz nudged it with a pinky. “This’ll trash your edge. Do you have a wood one? Or plastic?”
“Huh. Don’t those hold bacteria?” Yeah, Danny Brady, stirring conversationalist. He crouched down to rummage under the counter. He was pretty sure he’d gotten a cheap wood cutting board when he moved in.
Chaz crouched down beside him, legs folding like a roosting crane’s. Brady found the board under the sink and put it into his hands. “The science at this point tends to indicate that the wood has natural antibacterial properties,” Chaz declared, and flushed. Probably because he’d noticed he sounded like an issue of Scientific American.
In the dining room, Daphne cleared her throat and said, “I’ll go see how the girls are doing with that fire.”
“Hand me the lamb shank first?” Chaz levered himself upright and pointed to the cooler.
Daphne set her beer down long enough to paw through the ice and pull out a lump of plastic-sealed meat that looked like it would make a pretty good murder weapon. She thumped it onto the counter.
“Excelsior!” Chaz said. “There’s marinated chicken for the spiedies in there, too, and the soaked bamboo skewers. Why not take the whole thing outside and put the girls to work doing the obvious?”
“Slave driver,” she said, but she picked the lightened cooler up and propped it on her hip. Beer reclaimed, she rolled her eyes, blew her bangs out of them, and beat a hasty retreat to the back deck.
“What’s a spiedie?” Brady asked, intrigued enough to risk the lecture.
Chaz moved the lamb to the sink and nicked the plastic with his paring knife. “There’s two pots of chili verde in that biggest cooler,” he said, pointing with his elbow. “Could you stick them on the back of the stove to stay hot? The little one’s for Falkner, so don’t, you know—”
“Mix up the spoons,” Brady said, walking around the counter. “Right. You made chili verde.”
“Signature dish.” Dry as gin. A thump as Chaz laid the lamb shank on the cutting board. “I am from Vegas.”
“Which is not really the Southwest, man.”
“Yeah, yeah, Dallas. Whatever.” By the time Brady sorted the spoons and turned around, Chaz had butterflied the shank, and was running the tip of his knife underneath the bone, lifting it smoothly away from the meat.
Brady leaned over for a better look. Without looking up, Chaz said, “A spiedie is a kind of marinated meat grilled on skewers and served on folded-up slices of white Italian bread. It’s a southern New York thing. Originally they made them with lamb, but now they use anything—chicken, pork, venison. It’s meat and bread.” He winked, without missing a stroke of the knife. “You’ll like it.”
“And the lamb is also spiedies?”
“The lamb is just kabobs. Spiedies have to marinate for days.”
Whether it was the chef or the knife—or both—Brady had to admit, he couldn’t have done what Chaz was doing. He rolled his Coors between his palms and said, “The UNSUB is proficient with a knife, and familiar with anatomy. He may be a butcher, a hunter, have medical experience—”
“Or just be really hungry all the time.”
The knife danced, making impossibly tidy cubes. Emeril, eat your heart out. “Chaz, you’re going to cut your hand off, man.”
Chaz appeared not to have heard him. The knife would brush his fingertips on the next stroke, if it didn’t sever them. “Seriously,” Brady said.
But Chaz’s fingers whisked aside at the last moment, the knife came down, and the final cubes of lamb lay glistening on the board. “Nah,” he said, grinning like a stage magician after a particularly impossible trick. “I’m good at this.”
He pointed to the olive oil and garlic on the counter, this time using his chin as the indicator. “Can you assemble a marinade, Special Agent?”
Brady drained his beer and dropped the bottle into the recycling bin under the counter. “I have that training.”
“I defer to your experience, then, as senior agent. Don’t forget the red pepper, though... is that grin meant to make me uneasy?”
“That depends,” said Brady. He reached into the cabinet over the stove for a jar of crushed reds and opened a drawer for the whisk. “Have you ever worked bomb squad?”

Lau was a Valley Girl, dammit. She could figure out how to use a simple gas grill.
And that was half the problem. She could figure out how to use a simple gas grill, and that was not what this was. This looked like the navigation panel on the Starship Enterprise, and not the Sulu-era one with the slider and a couple of nonfunctional push buttons in primary colors, either.
“We Laus believe in proper mesquite barbecue. Otherwise, cook it inside in the air conditioning like civilized folk.”
Hafidha grinned. “Good try, Miss Direction. But you’re not getting out of this one.” She leaned over Lau’s shoulder, frowning, and pointed to a dial. “It looks like you should turn that to light, and then push the red button?”
“You’re not sure? You’re supposed to be the technologist.”
“That” —Hafidha aimed a long nail manicured in a starburst design at the gleaming red-enamel and chromed-steel temple of barbecue dominating the corner of Brady’s deck— “is no ordinary machine. Although it might in fact have a microchip in it. In which case, you should treat my guess as gospel truth.”
“Hmm. Daphs still right inside?”
Hafidha craned her neck toward the house, skeleton earrings dancing on her shoulders. “Looks it. Why?”
“Because if it blows up, we might need medical care. Right.” Lau extended a finger to the button. “Here goes nothing.”
It made a satisfying scraping sound. And even a bright blue spark. But there was no ignition, and no flame. “Right,” Hafidha said brightly. “No microchip!”
Lau stepped back and glared at the grill.
“You could ask Brady,” Hafidha offered. When Lau rolled her eyes, Hafidha added, “But you’d never hear the end of it.”
“You have no idea.” Visions of getting boxes of matches for Christmas for the next ten years danced through Lau’s head.
The sliding glass door scraped open, and Worth emerged, burdened with paper plates, bamboo skewers, and a gallon plastic bag full of what appeared to be raw chicken swimming in Italian dressing. “Fire and rescue,” she announced, cheerfully. “Chaz wants us to turn these into chicken shish kebab with a funny name.”
“Spiedies?” Hafidha bounced on her toes. “He made spiedies? Awesome!”
“All yours,” Lau said. “I don’t eat dead animal, and I’m not touching dead animal. But I am going to figure out this dratted NASA control module—”
Worth stretched to peer over the stack of paper plates. “Turn on the propane?”
“Huh?”
Worth set the food and paraphernalia on the picnic table, and came around to crouch beside Lau’s knee. She tapped the rosette handle of the off-white tank under the gas grill. “Propane. Turn it on?”
“Oh,” Lau said. She shook her head in disgust. “Spark plus flammable material. There goes my serial arsonist career.”
Worth edged the shutoff open. The hiss of escaping gas reached Lau’s ear, and as Worth stood she set the grill to “Light” again and pressed the button once.
Blue flame ran across the bottom of the grill like pooling water, and Lau and Hafidha cheered. Lau grinned, dusted her palms on her jeans, and stepped back from the grill. “There. You guys skewer the poultry. I’m going to go get a beer and see what Chaz brought for the noncarnivores.”
“Bring chips!” Hafidha said. “Problem-solving makes me hungry.”
Lau slid open the door and paused. Outside, Hafidha was showing Worth how to skewer chicken so it stayed put. Inside, Chaz and Brady were discussing food preparation in terms of past cases while pretending they weren’t trying to gross each other out.
Teamwork. It’s not just for the office anymore. “Villette, if you ate all that guacamole, you are a dead man.”

•

Esther Falkner spent twenty minutes wondering what to do with her hair.
At work, she wore it up, severe and businesslike. At home, she left it loose and long. It was another way to remind herself, Leave the job at the job. Leave home at home.
But compartmentalizing was a temporary coping strategy at best. It failed to account for a backyard potluck barbeque with her co-workers.
Her contributions to the food also required some internal negotiation. The tabbouleh was one of her party standards. But her other reflexive potluck contribution, salade niçoise, wouldn’t fly.
“Leave the tuna out,” Ben suggested. He sat at the desk in the kitchen, wearing the faded navy terrycloth robe he wouldn’t let her replace, cuddling his first cup of coffee and craning a little backward to read craigslist. His glasses were on the bedside table. He always said he didn’t need them for the computer.
Falkner sighed. “Anchovy paste in the dressing. It’s not salade niçoise without it.”
He got up to refill his cup. “Lau won’t know there’s anchovy paste in it if you don’t tell her.”
“I’ll know.”
He curled his arm around her waist and kissed her cheekbone, right in front of her ear; his breath brushed the lobe. “You’re a better man than I am.”
“Hah. Don’t give me ideas, you. I’m on deadline here.”
“Your family likes salade niçoise,” Ben said plaintively.
“Then I’ll make it for my family. Later.” She kissed him firmly on the mouth and felt the prickle of his three-day-weekend beard.
Instead she improvised a main-dish salad—black beans, corn, tomatoes, rice, sweet onion, romaine, and avocado in chili-lime vinaigrette. She had, thank God, two very large covered bowls.
Hafidha and Chaz would be there, after all.
She went upstairs, took the HK sub-compact out of her gun safe, slid it in the pancake holster and tucked that into the small of her back, and made sure her shirt tail covered it. When she leaned forward the shape would show under the oxford cloth, but at this party that wasn’t a concern.
Nothing left but the hair question. In a fit of desperation, she pulled it back, braided it, and let it hang.
Out in the hall, Rebekah’s bedroom door was open. Rebekah sat cross-legged against her pillows in shorts-and-tank-top pajamas. She’d had soft, dimpled baby knees and elbows once, and a face so round you could hardly tell she had bone underneath. Now she sported an absurdly stern nose and a lot of forehead, and Falkner thought when she shed the last of her puppy fat her chin would be pointed. She had too much arm and leg for the rest of her, and just this year she’d decided to hate her curly brown hair.
She was showing Deborah how to fold a paper airplane. Deborah lay on her stomach at the foot of the bed, her chin in her hands. Falkner always insisted the girls wear sunscreen (”Skin cancer is a stupid way to die”), but Deborah was already penny-colored, and it was only the end of May. Deborah insisted on wearing her smooth black hair short, because of tree-climbing and gymnastics and karate and the sort of thing nine-year-olds seemed to think ought to be done on a bicycle nowadays.
They both looked up as Falkner passed on the way to the stairs. “Hi, Mom,” Rebekah called. “Barbeque?”
“Yep. Be nice to your father, all right? He has no one to call for backup.”
“Say ’hi’ to Chaz.”
“Yeah!” Deborah looked up from the airplane and smiled.
Posters of boys Rebekah insisted on referring to as “hot” studded her bedroom walls. None of them had the faintest resemblance to Chaz Villette. Falkner decided she had not just detected a crush in action. “Will do.”
Woodbridge was on the other side of the D.C. sprawl from Silver Spring. She had plenty of time in the car to wonder if she should have invented a prior engagement. Nothing had as great a chilling effect on a party as the arrival of one’s immediate superior. Brady may have thought, back in the office, that the invitation was a good idea. Things might look different at his front door. Or he might have thought she was about as likely to show up as Reyes was.
Well, enter cheerful, declare she couldn’t stay long, make a tidy social circuit and a timely exit. Not that tough.
Brady’s house was a ferociously suburban single-story with a healthy, buzz-cut lawn and mounding junipers around the foundation. It was as considered and tended as his desk at work.
She juggled the bowls against her hip and rang the bell.
“Come in!” Chaz yelled, which was followed by Brady saying, “Hey, it’s my house.” She realized only the screen door was closed, and was about to try for the latch when Brady opened it.
“Hey, chief.” He scooped the top bowl deftly out of her arms before she could speak and held the door open with a foot. “Glad you could make it.” He nodded her across the living room toward a breakfast bar and the kitchen. “Chaz customized the chili verde for you.”
Chaz stuck his head around the corner and waved a knife that might have given an UNSUB heart failure. “Yours has chicken.” His wide mouth split his face in a grin. “Extra-spicy.”
She set her bowl down on the counter beside one full of tortilla chips. Chaz was using the knife to push cubed meat off a cutting board onto a platter. Lau crouched at the refrigerator, searching the door shelves for condiments.
She smiled over her shoulder at Falkner. “Hi, boss. Beer?”
“Please.” Her “I can’t stay long” speech was scattered in her head; she scrambled to reassemble it.
Brady set the other bowl down and popped the lid. “Tabbouleh!” Chaz crowed. “Perfect with lamb.” He pointed the knife at the platter. “You want to skewer these with alternating vegetable matter? Nikki refuses to enable.”
“I can cover for her.” Falkner took the lid off the salad. “Nothing you do can stop them, you know,” she told Lau.
“They have to want to change.” Lau handed her an opened beer and peered in the bowl. “Ooh, pretty. Ooh! Lime!”
Worth bounded in the sliding door from the back deck. “The rock things are hot. I think it’s time to burn some food. Oh, hi, boss!”
“The ’rock things?’” Brady repeated. He snagged half the pile of skewers from in front of Falkner and started threading lamb and blanched vegetables on them.
Worth blushed. “Bottom of the grill. Distribute heat. What do you call ’em?”
Brady considered for a moment. “Rocks.”
“See, I was close. Chaz, do we need instructions on how to eat the chicken that isn’t kabobs?”
Lau shook her head. “The nouns are the first to go.” Worth took a pretend swat at her.
Chaz slid past Worth and Lau to the stove like an envelope through a mail chute. He lifted the lid on a pot. “Fold a piece of Italian bread around it, pinch it off the skewer, bite, chew. Repeat.”
“Good plan,” Hafidha called from the sliding door. “Can we start doing it now? With chili? Hey, Es, you made it! Ooh, salad-thingie!”
“Tortillas should be warm by now,” Chaz replied. “You know the drill: eat it before I do.”
The moment had come and gone when Falkner could have made her casual speech. That was all right; she didn’t need it now, anyway. She nudged Brady with her elbow. “Pass me the cherry tomatoes.”

•

Chaz craned his neck to peer over Brady’s shoulder at the kebabs. “Don’t leave them too long,” he said, because he knew it would be annoying.
Lau grinned at Chaz across the barbeque, and the heat in his face had nothing to do with the gas fire. “You have no sense of self-preservation.”
But Brady’s voice and glare were relatively mild. “You aren’t the only person on earth who can make his own damned food.”
Chaz took another bite of Falkner’s salad and pointed at the paper plate with his fork. “Obviously.”
Worth, perched at the end of one of Brady’s lounge chairs on the lawn, looked up through the bangs that half-hid her eyes. “Good thing, too. Some of us would starve otherwise.” She followed that with a twitchy, apologetic smile, and shifted her gaze to the sapling tree at the corner of the deck. Sorry about the interruption, the gesture said. Don’t mean to force my way in.
Of course, she was already in; she was the only person who didn’t know it. Chaz wished he could think of a way to tell her so. Other than just telling her, which she wouldn’t believe.
Because she’d looked away, he could stare at her without making them both nervous. He liked her gray eyes, round and wide when she was focused on a puzzle. He liked her strong, square jaw, her straight shoulders, and the muscle that worked in her forearms and wrists when she moved. Noticing gave him a pleasant little shiver. Purely aesthetic.
Sure, Chaz. Stop cruising your coworkers.
At least without encouragement.
Brady turned the skewers one after the other, a practiced, left-to-right sweep, and flipped the burgers beside them with the spatula in his other hand. Not bad for a guy who kept his knives loose in a drawer. Chaz breathed in the odors of searing lamb and beef. Flesh, blood, and char. Put that way, it ought to be disgusting. Instead it made his stomach growl. If he opened his mouth, he thought he’d drool like a St. Bernard.
A rising sound—a rumble like an unnaturally regular avalanche—reached the backyard from the street out front. Stomach, meet motorcycle. You guys sound like kinfolk.
“Duke’s here!” called Hafidha. She and Falkner were out on the grass, deploying hoops and posts for croquet.
Brady raised his eyebrows at Chaz and waved the spatula at the house. “Get the door?”
“Guess I’ll have to trust you with the cooking,” Chaz sighed, and bolted before Brady could throw something other than food at him.
Chaz got to the front door as Sol Todd, helmet in one hand and cooler in the other, jogged up the step. The Harley leaned rakishly at the curb behind him.
“Brady said if you actually brought fermented duck eggs, I’m not allowed to let you in.”
Todd shook his head. “Daniel Brady. A lion in the face of a psychotic killer. A mouse when confronted with duck ova.”
“Fermented duck ova.”
Todd held up the cooler. “Orchid noodles.”
“Oh!” Chaz held the screen door open. “Enter freely, go safely, and leave something of the carbohydrates you bring.”
“Not the most reassuring quote.” Todd stepped over the threshhold.
“Don’t worry. We’ve probably got enough food that no one’s going to bite your neck. Probably.”
He led Todd through the kitchen—”I like the glass brick,” Todd said, so Chaz told him, “So does Brady, but he won’t admit it”—and out onto the deck. Todd set the cooler down on the boards, lifted out a big square container and blue plastic tongs, and set them on the end of the folding table where the rest of the food was spread. When he took off the lid, Chaz breathed in a blended fragrance of sesame oil, soy sauce, and red pepper.
“Two-minute warning for carnivores,” Brady called.
The sliding door screen scraped open. “Good timing,” said Stephen Reyes, as he stepped out on the deck.
He wore a light green linen guayabera shirt, and pants that, however casual they were meant to be, still looked dressy on Reyes. And he carried a big stoneware crock with a towel wrapped around it like a muffler around a throat.
Reyes had come.
Chaz realized he’d begun to think of Reyes as being reconstituted every morning, then dried to a powder in the evenings and stored overnight, unless they were in the field. But here he was, magician’s entrance and all.
And he’d brought food.
“Frijoles negros,” Reyes said, and Chaz blushed, wondering just how much of his last twenty seconds’ thought had scrolled across his face in lights. All of it, probably.
With a single swift movement Reyes slipped the towel off the crock, coiled it down on the table for a hot pad, and set the pot on it.
“You cook?” Chaz’s voice cracked with surprise.
“To eat well, cook well.” It sounded like a quote. Reyes tapped the lid. “My mother’s recipe.”
It occurred to Chaz to see if anyone else was as flat-footed as he was. Too late; if they were, they’d recovered. But he thought Brady, Lau, Hafidha, and Worth, at least, might have had something to recover from, given their studiously bland expressions.
Brady held out a skewer. “In that case, you can tell me if these are done. I don’t trust Chaz.”
“Hey!”
Chaz snagged the second sample. They were done. He pretended to be grudging about the approval.
“There is meat,” Brady announced, and everyone but Lau (who got to the orchid noodles before Chaz) converged like kids on a puppy.
Well, only if they intended to eat the puppy. Now is not the time to think of Mrs. Chow.
There wasn’t room at the picnic table for everyone at once. (As at work, so at play, Chaz observed, and wondered if he should say it out loud.) So they cycled, depending on who had gotten up for seconds. Eventually Chaz ended up cross-legged on the grass with an embarrassingly large wedge of Hafidha’s German chocolate cake on a paper plate on his knee.
Worth dropped down beside him with a bowl full of vividly-ripe strawberries. “I love spring,” she sighed.
“Strawberries and asparagus,” Chaz agreed. “Not a bad consolation for winter.”
She popped a berry in her mouth and bit it off its stem. She smelled like sunscreen and green apple shampoo and now, strawberries. Chaz realized he was staring. He dropped his eyes to his plate and hewed a chunk off the cake.
Worth studied the others as she chewed, so he did, too: Falkner, Reyes, Lau, and Hafidha at the picnic table, Brady and Todd refilling plates at the folding table on the deck.
Chaz waited for her to break the silence. When it didn’t seem about to happen, he said, “Family cookout in the backyard.”
She turned, cocked her head. “Complete with emotionally-distant father figure,” she agreed, and grinned.
“Hey, I was expecting ’absent.’”
“Lau had to pick her eyeballs up off the deck.”
“So it wasn’t just me! Ex.”
“Mom’s straight face went a little crooked.”
Chaz shook his head. “Didn’t happen.”
“Did! Perceptible motion!”
Chaz snorted.
“How’s the cake?” Worth gazed at his plate wistfully.
“Here.” He held up his plate and thrust his fork at her. When she looked like refusing, he said, “No, seriously.”
She shrugged, took the fork, and shaved a little off, with frosting.
“Oh, come on.”
“I don’t want you to go hungry.” Her deadpan was a beautiful thing. She took the bite. “Mm. On the other hand, that could be bad for you.”
“Don’t even think about it. Come on, we’ll get you your own piece.”
Reyes was scooping seconds of chili verde from the bottom of the pot when they hopped up the steps to the deck. Chaz felt absurdly pleased. You feed your family. And after tasting the Cuban black beans, Chaz thought he could consider Reyes’s seconds a compliment.
Worth cut a stingy piece off Hafidha’s cake while Chaz surveyed the remains on the table. Not bad: the sole evidence of the speidies was one heel of the Italian bread; the ceviche was reduced to a little juice and bits of garlic in the bottom of the bowl; and Reyes was claiming the last tortilla.
Chaz considered his own internal well-being. Not too shabby. He felt substantial and contented. His teammates around the picnic table looked about the way he felt.
“I know why I’m all about the food,” he said to Reyes. “But what’s everyone else’s excuse?”
Reyes followed his gaze, narrow-eyed. Falkner, Brady, Lau, Todd, Hafidha, laughing and talking and eating. It made Chaz happy. And frightened. He had a lunatic urge to keep feeding them, to keep them at that table forever. As long as they were there, everything was all right. He felt Worth come up on his left, eating cake, and he wanted to freeze her there, too.
But Reyes turned to look at him, and time kept moving. “Isaiah 22:13,” Reyes said. “’Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die.’”

Knock on Coffins | by Elizabeth Bear

“Drive on, think positive, get off your butts, knock on coffins, etc.”
— David Berkowitz, 1977

Act I
June 2007
Each Friday morning, Hafidha brought in two dozen doughnuts. One box contained two plain old-fashioned (Reyes); two sour cream glazed (Falkner); one chocolate dipped and one lemon-filled, no powder (Brady); one blueberry cake (Lau); one glazed and one chocolate-frosted (Worth); and two chocolate crullers (Todd). Because the bakery Hafidha favored considered any proper dozen to contain thirteen, she added two miscellaneous pastries, different every week.
The other box held six Boston custard creme, six assorted jelly, and a single chocolate-frosted with rainbow sprinkles. There was only one house rule regarding their consumption: no one could have the sprinkled one until all the rest were eaten. Hafidha and Chaz schemed mightily after that thirteenth doughnut, even when stragglers remained in the first box. Because the second dozen was the exclusive property of Shadow Unit’s anomaloids, and God save any alpha—Special Agent or civilian employee—who wandered too near.

•

Daniel Brady watched rangy, brown-skinned, floppy-haired Chaz Villette spider across the bullpen from the kitchenette, four pastries balanced on a napkin and a cup of coffee in the other hand. Chaz nibbled at the Boston creme doughnut teetering atop his pile with crooked, functional teeth. Brady ran his tongue across his own even bite, wondering if years of orthodonture had been worth it.
Brady leaned across the divider to Nikki Lau’s desk and stage-whispered, “You know, a lot of serial killers are serious sugar junkies—”
“I heard that.” Chaz slid into his desk across the aisle. If Brady were a strobe camera, Chaz would have been leaving trails of elbows and knees on the film. Chocolate smeared his upper lip; he sipped coffee and licked it off. “Is that true? I’ve never seen it in the literature.”
“What, you might not have read a book in the English language?”
“It’s Truman Capote,” Solomon Todd said, from his desk behind Chaz’s. He did not look up from a series of pie charts that appeared to hold him engrossed. “In Cold Blood. Our Danny boy is a reader.”
Todd was fit, five-seven, bespectacled over dark-ringed gray irises, and somewhere in the indeterminate valley between forty-five and sixty. His dark hair was balding, his long unassuming face defined by horizontal lines: the slash of a concerned frown, the ladder of concentration up his brow. He mostly moved like somebody was puppeteering him. Hafidha called him Duke, after the comics character.
Brady was catching it.
“See? Capote. It must be true.” Brady winked at Chaz, then turned back to Lau as she made one of her characteristic thinking fidgets. She wasn’t his type, but he could manage an aesthetic appreciation of a pretty Chinese-American woman tucking glossy razor-cut hair behind a seashell ear.
She said, “Just be grateful you don’t have to eat like that.”
Enter Daphne Worth, stirring coffee, compact and professional in a tan summerweight pantsuit and a burgundy blouse that flattened her pale complexion, brown hair caught back in a short ponytail. “Grateful? I wish I could eat like that. But no, a second plate of spaghetti and you might as well roll me home.”
“I’ll eat it for you,” Chaz offered, licking raspberry jelly off his mouth, one forefinger, and then his mouth again. There was powdered sugar on the lapel of a blue blazer that made him look like an awkward teenager dressed up as an FBI agent.
“Sure, but then I don’t get to enjoy it, except as garlic sweat—” Whatever Worth had been about to say would hang forever unfinished on the air, because Esther Falkner—tall, athletic, brunette, olive-complected, reflexively hiding the old sore hitch in her step—swept past with a coffee cup in her right hand and a manila folder upraised in her left, her head tipped slightly toward it. Her loafers made no sound on the industrial gray carpet, and the gray wings of her tailored suit coat flared from her hips.
Chaz accordioned half a doughnut into his mouth and stood, dusting the powder from his coat. Brady held back and waited until Chaz, and Lau, and Worth, and Todd had grabbed cups and pens and notepads and Palm Pilots and Blackberries and fallen in behind Falkner like a row of somewhat flustered ducklings, and only then joined the end of the line.
Because tail-end Charlie was his job, that was why.

•

The briefing room was already hot and close, prickling sweat across Todd’s bare scalp. He scrunched sideways in his seat to make more room for Brady’s football-player shoulders, happy enough to have won the daily game of musical chairs. Hafidha Gates was last, having the furthest to walk. But Hafidha always got a seat, on behalf of her laptop—and the preservation of the credit rating of anybody who might try to shark her. And nobody but Reyes ever took Reyes’ chair.
Falkner never sat during briefings, and today the other odd woman out was Lau, even though Brady had arrived after her, because Lau was standing outside and availing herself of the breathable oxygen which would soon be in short supply within the room.
As soon as Lau edged inside the door and shut it, Falkner started talking. “The good news is that to the best of our knowledge, nobody is dead.”
“Great,” said Brady, blocky hands folded. “Then the bad news would be the fate worse than death?”
Falkner’s eyebrows were as good as a soliloquy, and Todd hid a responding smirk behind his coffee cup. From the short end of the table, where he could keep his back to the wall, Stephen Reyes replied to the covert gesture with a bushy-eyebrowed stare. His face was the color of an antique walnut table, and his expression about as forthcoming.
Todd saluted with the beverage. After a while, you just got used to Reyes noticing things. He almost never said anything to anyone about what he noticed, and certainly never to anyone whose business it wasn’t.
Todd supposed that made him ethical.
There are no fates worse than death, Todd recited. One of the catchphrases they lived by, but he wasn’t always convinced. Well, it was a strong theme, and worth exploring. Though maybe it should be an argument and not a statement. Are there fates worse than death? What are fates worse than death? Can you phrase your answer in the form of a question?
“Something like that,” Falkner said, humorless. Chaz fiddled with his gadgety wristwatch and Brady abruptly got very interested in his Blackberry. “Someone in Omaha is driving college freshmen crazy.”
“Crazy’s not exactly a technical diagnosis.” Chaz wiped his fingers on his trouser leg and picked up his mug. Milk fat on the surface reflected light.
“All right,” Falkner said. “Symptoms of a psychotic break. There’s an epidemic of schizophrenia at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.”
“Schizophrenia isn’t contagious,” Worth pointed out.
“It is now. Five victims that we know of. All college-age, two men and three women, who would appear low-risk at the initial appraisal.”
“Who’s our liaison?” Lau asked. “How did we get an in on this one? Going crazy isn’t a crime.”
“The university president contacted the local field office directly, asking for help. His theory was that somebody might be spiking the victims, but there’s no toxicology to support it. They kicked it up the ladder to the BAU. Pete Pauley says he got it last night, stared at it, shrugged, and decided to hand it to us. Everyone be sure to send a thank-you note.”
Brady raised a finger. “Omaha PD?”
Falkner shook her head. “The police have had minimal involvement. We get to walk into this one at the top, which might be helpful.”
Todd watched Reyes follow the reactions around the room.
Reyes cleared his throat and spoke. “The victimology is straightforward on the surface, Brady, but the first go-round with the profiles is yours. Find out what they have in common, who they know in common. Look for patterns of low self-esteem, emotional vulnerability, anger or aggressiveness. I don’t know if you’ll find anything about recent changes in demeanor in the files, but look at their grades. I’ll lead the team on-site.”
“Regarding the mental illness. If that’s what it is. Symptomatology?” Worth asked.
Falkner, with a glance at Reyes for authorization, answered. “Typical of schizophrenia. Auditory hallucinations, conflation, disorganized thinking, flat affect. It’s not clear if they’re exhibiting consistency of hallucinations from one victim to the next.”
Reyes said, “That’s one of the things we need to assess when we get on the ground.”
Todd said, “You’re thinking of the case in Augusta.” A year and a half before, a gamma in Maine had been infecting his neighbors with his nightmares. Two had been driven to suicide and a third had attempted it before the WTF stepped in. “Could it be a similar manifestation?”
Reyes shrugged. “They’re all the right age for first signs of schizophrenia. Victimology will tell us if they all have troubled backgrounds. And then there’s the timing.”
“Five victims,” Chaz said. “Assuming for the moment that they’re all linked, and it would be very coincidental indeed if they weren’t.” He flipped papers. “One every six weeks to two months, if you need it or not. With time off for the holidays?”
“Or,” Falkner said, “a sixth victim off-campus. No classes during winter break means no prey on the ground. He might have had to extend his hunting range. He wouldn’t have wanted to break pattern. I’m sure he needs his fix.”
“Crap,” said Worth. “Hafidha, can you check police blotters?”
Reyes made a gathering gesture, right-handed. “Belay that until Omaha. We’ll interview known associates when we get there. Todd, Lau, Gates, you’re with me on this one. Hafidha, bring your gun.”
He might have been ostensibly talking to Hafidha, but he was looking right at Todd. In response, Todd let the corner of his mouth twitch. There was Reyes, letting him know Reyes knew he had never liked carrying. But he was the best detail man on the team when it came to extracting secrets contained in mounds of paperwork. Professional slogger’s skill from his journalist days. Like constructing narratives. Surprising how much carried over.
Reyes finished, “I have no idea what we’re walking into, and I want everybody combat-ready.”
“Hafs?” Worth, looking startled.
“Universities have computers,” Reyes said, intentionally thick-headed. “So do university students.”
Worth leaned over to Hafidha and murmured, “You’re field-certified?”
Hafidha’s blonde-black braids made a whispering sound over one another when she shook her head. Todd looked down at his hands while she answered. “I’m a sworn officer, honey. Six years in the Secret Service. Fraud and counterfeiting, mostly. I know which end to point at the bad man.”
“She’s a certified small-arms instructor,” Falkner said, dryly. “Don’t let her yank your chain, Worth. You head out in ninety minutes; Hafidha, show Worth what she needs to run com from here?”
“I can do that,” Hafidha said. “But I can’t give her my eyes. So I’ll start going over blotters on the plane. Maybe a disturbance will come over Technicolor and we can find number six. If there is a number six.”
“If there isn’t,” Falkner said, “there will be soon. It’s nearly the end of the term. He’ll want to get one more before summer.”

•

“British royal family?”
Hafidha was pleased to discover that Daphne had mastered the gentle art of watching the screen without leaning over Hafidha’s shoulder. Good for her. Reyes still hadn’t figured it out. “I had detail on Princess Anne, once.”
“Boring.”
“Sweetie pie, it was the Secret Service, not the staff of People magazine.” Daphne looked forlorn, so Hafidha gave her hand a pat. “Be a good girl and focus on the nice database search parameters, and I’ll give you a truckload on the Pretzel Incident.”
“Oooh!” Daphne poised the stylus over her Palm obediently.
Brady, leaning on the back counter and drinking coffee, looked up from the victim files. “If you compromise national security, I’m telling.”
“You pay attention. You might need to know this someday, too.”
“Do I look like a search string kind of guy? Or a Pretzel Incident kind of guy, for that matter?”
Hafidha slid her glasses down her nose and looked at him over the top of the frames. “What, you’re too pretty to be smart?”
Daphne snickered.
“Okay, okay.” Brady sounded grudging, but he grinned. “I’m paying attention.”
As Hafidha was setting permissions on Daphne’s login, Chaz wandered in, a crisp-creased sheet of paper in one hand. It fluttered with the soft sound of high-rag-content laid. Her overhead light shone through the translucent watermark: Crane’s Bond. Spendy.
Chaz looked from Brady to Daphne, frowning for a moment before correcting his face into a smile. Hafidha guessed he’d hoped to catch her alone, but the paper in his hand was a confession of intent, and he wasn’t about to back down where anybody could see him. “Hey. Not just Velma, it’s Fred and Daphne, too!”
Daphne pointed a finger at him and tipped her head; she packed an effective glower. “That still makes you Shaggy.”
“I would still rather be the dog.” Chaz smiled disarmingly, then set the paper down on the console beside Hafidha’s keyboard. Daphne backed away, giving him room. Chaz hated to be crowded; funny how anybody with any sense picked up on that right away.
He said, “Hafs, I want to know if this is a scam.” His fingers moved nervously as he reached to smooth the letter, as if he had to find an excuse to touch it.
It looked real. Letterhead for an attorney in Tyler, Texas, the language just what it ought to be from a law office to notify the beneficiary of a will. Namely, Chaz.
Hafidha leaned back in her chair, hands clasped in her lap. “And this is work-related how?”
Chaz craned his gazelle neck to look over his shoulder, scanning for Falkner or Reyes. He turned back and tapped the paper with fingers that had not left its surface when he turned. “Look, you can have the thirteenth doughnut, okay? Just please can you run the search before you go?”
She cracked her shoulders against the back of the chair, and grinned. “Smarty-boy, you know better than to ask that question.”
“You’re right. Bad choice of words. I meant ’would you.’”
“See?” She sat up and skittered fingers across keys. “It’s all in how you ask. So, property description...aaand title on file...and there you go. Yep, you are the proud owner of forty acres of Tyler County, Texas. Says so right there.” Hafidha poked the screen. “Ooh, real estate. I smell money.”
Chaz snuck a handful of chocolate—the good stuff; Hafidha didn’t hold with slave-labor candy—out of her stash, no doubt to make up for the sacrificial doughnut. He leaned over her shoulder without touching her. “Charles Travis Villette. Would you look at that.”
Hafidha read up the screen. Deeded to Adeline Mary Villette (deceased). Previous title holders, Francis William and Mary Perault Villette.
And Chaz said, “Huh. I own a ranch. Small ranch. Real small ranch, for Texas.”
Brady said, “Kid, that’s East Texas. It’s not a ranch. It’s a farm.”
Chaz chuckled. “Wonder if it comes with a mule.”
Hafidha said, “Your grandparents?”
“Dunno,” he said. “I guess.” The candy pattered back into the bowl. Apparently he’d thought better of it. Hafidha didn’t mind; Chaz’s hands were always clean. “Adeline was my mom.”
He might have said more, Hafidha thought. She could feel his confusion hanging in the air between them. But Brady, the Texas boy, cleared his throat. “You don’t sound like Tyler County.”
The expectant moment snapped. Chaz straightened up, stuffing his hands into his back pockets. “I’ve never been there. But my mom sounded like Tyler County. Well, she didn’t sound like Vegas.”
Daphne cleared her throat. “So what’s Tyler County sound like?”
Chaz, shaking his head, picked up his letter even as Hafidha was pulling up Google Earth, Google Maps, TerraServer, and a few less public satellite imaging systems. He said, “Can’t do it. Never could. So... the Tyler County seat would be in, um, Tyler?”
She knew a subject change when she heard one. “Oh, you’d think. But the Lord and the state of Texas work in mysterious ways, honey. Tyler’s in Smith County. The biggest burg in Tyler County is...” Typing. “Woodville.” She snickered. “Population 2,415.”
“Good grief. How do you get there?” He’d grown up under the approach paths of the seventh—now sixth—busiest airport in the U.S, she recalled.
Warm plastic smoothed under her fingertips, the action of her vintage M-series keyboard clicking rewardingly with every keystroke. They didn’t make ’em like this anymore.
“DFW to a regional airport two hours away. If you drive really fast. Oooh, I bet they have killah speed traps.” She turned and caught his gaze, the left eye brighter than the right, with the green streaks in it. Funny to think it used to weird her out, and now it was just Chaz.
“Sweetie, I think you inherited the location where they shot Deliverance. Sshh...” She held up a hand. “Paddle faster, I hear banjos.”
“Could you maybe not have quite so much fun with this?” But he was grinning.
“Want me to Google the directions for you?” Her fingers hovered the keyboard. “Want to see the house?”
“Ngh. No, thanks. It’s been there since—” Hafidha recognized the hesitation. The date was on the title, which was now in Chaz’s head. “—1952. It’ll stay there for a while.”
She had already started typing. Her fingers stumbled on the keys. “Don’t you want to get in touch with your roots?”
“God, no.” He backed away. She’d lost him. And the profilers in the room were both looking up curiously as he sidled towards the door. “My mom grew up in a Steve Earle song. I get it. I get it.”
He didn’t make three steps before Danny went after him, calling, “Hey Chaz. If you’re not busy, help me with the victimology!” leaving Daphne and Hafidha standing in an uncomfortable silence in Hafidha’s office.
It was hard being the new kid. All these dynamics, all this implied knowledge, and no way in to it unless you picked it up from context, or asked.
Asking was one of the things Daphne seemed pretty good at. “Hafs, what just happened?”
“Ah.” Hafidha snagged a handful of chocolate from the bowl and held it up for Daphne, who accepted. “At a guess? Chaz just inherited forty acres of nowhere from a relative he didn’t even know he had, and he’s a little freaked out about it.”
“How can you not know you have grandparents? Everybody has grandparents.”
“But not everybody knows their grandparents, honey. Chaz’s mom died when he was a wee bitty child. So based on that letter he showed me, I’d also guess his grandparents didn’t know their daughter was dead, or that they had a grandson. It’d rattle anybody.”
“Shit,” Daphne said. “I’m glad I didn’t ask him—”
Hafidha shrugged. “Long time ago. Want another chocolate?”
“No, thanks.” She popped the last one from her hand into her mouth. When she spoke, the smell of candy followed. “Hafs, can I ask you a question that’s totally inappropriate for the workplace?”
“Honey, inappropriate is my internet identity. Unless you’re going to ask for a date, in which case, flattered, but I like boys.”
Daphne laughed, strained and nervous. Not uncomfortable with Hafidha flirting, but with whatever she was about to say. “No, I’m seeing someone. But while we’re on Chaz. And his family. Does Chaz, er, what I mean is—”
“Does he have an ethnic identity?” It was the question everybody asked, sooner or later. Hafidha arched one eyebrow like Mister Spock. She could do the Bewitched nose-wriggle, too, if called upon.
From the way she winced against the red tide rising across her cheeks, Daphne was probably wishing she had an ethnic identity at that particular moment. But she held it together and asked, “I thought he was just white—maybe Mediterranean French, or something—and funny-looking. And then he came to the thing on Memorial Day weekend a different color. In just a couple of days. Most folks don’t tan that fast. But Villette isn’t any kind of Hispanic name I’ve ever heard of...”
Hafidha winked. “Well, Reyes is, and the nefarious Doctor Stephen’s darker than me—”
“Afro-Cuban. Sure. I get that. I just wondered about Chaz.”
“Ah, and you see, sweetie, you’re going to keep wondering. Because from what he tells me, nobody knows for sure. When he first got here it was September, and I thought he was a brother. But now I suspect it’s something complicated back there. Black, white, Latino, Indian, the other kind of Indian—who knows? Some kind of Creole. He’s too pretty not to be mixed—”
“Pretty? Chaz? The amazing frog-boy?”
Hafidha frowned pityingly. “There are none so blind as will not see. Anyway, he’s not done getting brown yet. Our Chaz is a sun-worshipper; I bet he spent that long weekend baking on the roof of his apartment building, to which he has—I happen to know—picked the lock. By the end of the summer he’ll be caramel-sauce-colored, and you can watch the convenience store clerks try to speak to him in Spanish. It’s fun. He goes, you know, like the top of the crème brûlée, when they’ve burnt it just right so there aren’t any black spots, but it’s all nice sweet crunchy melty brown sugar?”
Hafidha watched the emotions cross Daphne’s face, and guessed that first, she was considering the possibilities. And then, she was considering just walking away from that one. But she said, “Isn’t it politically incorrect to refer to people of color as food objects?”
Hafidha laughed. “Just don’t expect me to stop calling you Peaches, Peaches.”
Through the open door, Hafidha could see Reyes coming up the corridor from his office. Nearly time to go. She kicked off her shoes, scuffed on the flats, and unlocked the lower drawer of her desk. Her jump bag was in there, flowered green nylon wearing a thin coat of dust. And under it, lying beside the holster, was a field-stripped Glock and a box of ammo. She lifted the latter items onto the blotter and began to assemble her sidearm, aware Worth was watching curiously.
When she stood up and clipped the holster to her belt, the weight tugged that side of her slacks down. She sighed and clipped the Treo, the work cell, her nerd-light, and her Leatherman on to the other side, where they counterbalanced it... and further ruined the line of her suit.
At Hafidha’s eyeroll and hand gestures, Daphne laughed. And then she looked Hafidha in the eye, all serious, and said, “Hafs? Do you have the hots for Chaz?
Hafidha rocked back on her heels. “Oh, God, no. I have the hots for crème brûlée.”
Act II
The first notable thing Todd saw on the campus of the University of Nebraska at Omaha was the obligatory phallic obelisk. The second one was a smiling blonde way too young for the Iggy & The Stooges babydoll t-shirt she was falling out of. “The more things change,” he muttered, and leaned forward over the back of the driver’s seat of the inevitable dark purple 2003 Intrepid to tap Reyes on the shoulder. Briefly, he wondered who in procurement was getting the kickbacks from Dodge.
Then he wondered when purple got to be a government car color.
“We can’t stop here. This is bat country.”
At least Hafidha laughed. “That’s Nevada, Duke.”
“Nevada, Nebraska—”
“Don’t let Chaz hear you say that.” Lau, from the front seat, without looking up from the dossier in her lap. Sol, to everyone’s amusement, puked if he tried to read in a moving car. “Let me guess. You still have nightmares about riding route 80 in the driving rain on a Harley, strung out on reds and megadoses of vitamin C.”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” he said, and sat back, satisfied. “I’d never use nutritional supplements off-label. My God, would you look at all these white people?”
He got Hafidha again, this time just as she was stuffing a doughnut hole into her mouth. It was worth a shower of crumbs, especially since Lau got the worst of it. And despite Hafidha’s obvious culpability in the unscheduled flurry, Lau glared at Todd as she dusted cake out of her hair. Oh, the injustice.
“I hate to interrupt the camaraderie,” Reyes said, “but once we get Hafidha installed, Lau, you take the victims’ known associates. Todd, you and I are going to interview the victims.”
“Just like the sixties,” Todd said.
The car pulled up—on Dodge Street, synchronistically—in front of the administration building. Just like in the movies. Except here, the spaces were available because the curb was yellow. There was metered parking off to one side, but Reyes just slid an FBI don’t-tow-me plaque onto the dash and the occupants exited on an internal count of three. Reyes didn’t even have to cue them anymore; they started manipulating the instant they got off the plane.
The funny thing was, no matter how transparent Sol thought the psychological games were, they worked. It’s for their own good, he told himself sardonically.
I’m sorry. Could you phrase the answer in the form of a question?
The steeply pitched convex dark roofs over each entryway made the building look as if one of its grandparents had been a merrywidow Queen Anne Victorian, and another a nice block of flats. Campus Security met them halfway up the walk, in the company of a balding and colorless blue-eyed administrator. Todd was in the second rank, behind Reyes, but the man’s gaze found him automatically. “Doctor Reyes?”
“Doctor Reyes,” Todd said, pointing to Reyes. “I’m Special Agent Todd.”
Reyes stuck out his hand, impassive, and watched unsmiling as the administrator wrong-footed, stumbled, balked coming up to the jump, and somehow managed to get over it with only a hard rub and a wobble. “Doctor Reyes. Pleased to meet you.”
“Winston Woodward?”
Todd could almost hear the I presume?
“Sorry,” Woodward said. “I assumed from your name that you would be Latino, and— well, there’s no excuse.”
As they turned to follow Woodward out of the sun, Hafidha tilted her head to bring her lips to Todd’s ear and murmured, “¿De cuál parte de México vienes, Doctor Reyes?”
Todd bit his lip to keep from cracking up. Thank God they had Lau and Reyes along; he really hadn’t ever mastered this professional demeanor thing. At least Woodward was still too flustered to notice, and talking fast: “Please, come inside, Doctor Reyes. And your team?”
“You’ve met Supervisory Special Agent Todd,” Reyes said dryly. “This is Special Agent Lau, and this is Special Agent Gates, our technical expert. She’ll need access to your network, and mainframe, if you still use one.”
“Of course.” Woodward rubbed his eyes. “I really hope you can help me, sir.”
“So do I.” Reyes straightened his tie, then smoothed his palm over tight-clipped curls as they advanced three abreast down a tiled corridor. Fidgeting. Uncomfortable, and Todd didn’t think it was Woodward’s unconscious, apologetic racism that had done it. Not for the first time, Todd wondered what had happened to get between Dr. Stephen Reyes and a brilliant academic career. He pretended to study a bulletin board which they passed, plastered with pastel flyers for campus clubs and events—the local SCA barony, a student band, a self-defense club, BiGALA. They were exactly like the flyers Todd remembered from his own tenure as an undergrad, except in that computer typesetting and modern printing and copying had vastly improved their apparent professionalism.
They turned into an outer office and walked past a vacant secretary’s desk. “We’ll know more once we’ve had a chance to talk to the victims.”
Woodward, hand on his office door, hesitated. “Well,” he said. “Then I also hope you can get something out of them.”

•

Falkner crossed the bullpen, only two pizzas balanced on her left hand, because half the team was elsewhere. She set them down on the desk in the uninhabited office where the photocopier lived. Todd probably could have planted a flag in it based on seniority, but he claimed he didn’t work well without constant supervision. There were pay grade rules about windows and cubicles and who got an actual office with an actual door, but the WTF wasn’t exactly the fast track to promotion. And Falkner was proud of her people, who all seemed to think they had important things to worry about.
She didn’t need to ding the service bell Brady had mounted on the wall beside the door. Chaz was already standing just outside. “Lunchtime?”
Behind him, she could see Brady stuffing a file into his locking drawer and setting the screen saver to blank his computer. Good man. He stood up, Worth a half-step behind—her hands already full of beverages—and followed Chaz into the room. “Time for the victimology?”
“Red rum and red sauce,” Worth answered, while Chaz, with arms like derricks, reached down the napkins and the paper plates. “Thank you, Falkner.”
“It’s Friday,” she said, and opened the first box: half pepperoni and half sausage, with green peppers and mushrooms on the lot. The second one was cheese and veg, and even though Lau wasn’t here to help, Falkner thought Chaz would get through at least three quarters of it. Brady wouldn’t eat anything that wasn’t swimming in animal fat, and since none of the others would let Falkner hold the cheese, one pizza with artichoke hearts, black olives, sundried tomatoes, and garlic was her compromise.
Besides, Chaz liked vegetables. It always surprised her. He could no more live on them than a cat could, but as he’d said to her once when she’d raised eyebrows over his lunch of a Greek salad you could swim in and an entire loaf of garlic bread, “Just because I’m going to die of major organ failure by fifty, doesn’t mean I need to hurry the process.”
She could have done without the reminder that he and Hafidha were on borrowed time, but nothing ever got won by telling yourself pretty lies. The savage metabolisms that fed their slamming neurons would also eventually poison their livers and kidneys, if heart disease didn’t get them first. Chances were, she and Reyes and Todd would outlive them both.
For every gift there is an answering burden.
She slid two slices of artichoke pizza onto the paper plate Brady handed her and took a diet Coke from Worth. Then she pulled out the chair in the corner between the table and the copier and sat, draping two napkins across her lap. “Right,” she said. “Victimology. What have we got?”
Brady flipped open a reporter’s notebook while he chewed. He swallowed, wiped his mouth, and ran a finger down the page, leaving a grease spot. “Okay, first known victim is Danielle Potter, age eighteen. Her suitemates had her committed in September, after she began acting erratically and they feared for her safety. No family history of mental illness; she was a good kid there on scholarship, first of her family to attend college. Second victim, Peter Gooding. Age seventeen, a week shy of his eighteenth birthday—”
“Young for a college freshman,” Worth said.
Chaz hmphed around a mouthful of pizza. Identifying. Falkner made a face she hoped could be blamed on the diet Coke. She could hover over Chaz, but he was here now, and doing all right, and she couldn’t change how he’d gotten there.
“Plenty of seventeen-year-olds graduate high school,” Brady continued, so smoothly you could pretend you hadn’t noticed him taking Chaz’s side. He ate another bite of sausage pizza without moving his eyes from the notepad. “Gooding was always a bit of a smart, disaffected underachiever, according to his family. Parents divorced; mom worked full time; father remarried. Sounds like he didn’t get a lot of guidance at home. Family became concerned when he didn’t return home for Christmas break as planned. He was found wandering, incoherent, and brought into an emergency room on New Year’s Eve. Suffering hypothermia and frostbite.” A brief silence followed while Brady chewed.
“Did he lose any fingers?” Worth said.
“You mean like Todd?” Chaz said.
Brady snorted. “Villette, if you believe that frostbite story of Duke’s, you’re not much of a profiler. He wasn’t pushing papers in the Quartermaster’s Corps in 1973, either.”
“There wasn’t much of anything involving American troops going on in southeast Asia in 1973, was there?” Chaz asked.
Brady shrugged. “Officially. But it’s not like Duke was ever anywhere interesting, to hear him tell it—”
Falkner cleared her throat. “Can we save the rumormongering until after the victimology, or preferably until Todd is here to defend himself?”
Chaz winced—sorry—and helped himself to the final two slices of veggie pizza by way of apology. “So. Gooding. Family history of mental illness?” He flipped the box closed left-handed and slid it out of the way with his elbow.
“Mother is on an SSRI,” Brady said. He shrugged.
Falkner shrugged too. So was her husband Ben, and half their friends. The modern world stressed people out, and the medical system was adapted to jack them up, prop them up, and shoot them back out into play. She thought of race horses, doped to run when what they really needed was rest, and nailed that chain of thought before it could get away from her.
“Soma,” Chaz said.
Worth gave him an odd look. “Soma’s a muscle relaxant.”
He shook his head, held up a hand, chewed vigorously, and reached for his coffee mug, only to find it empty. Worth pushed a spare Diet Coke at him, and he made a face and spurned it with his fingertips. “My liver does not thank you. No, not Soma Compound. Soma as in Brave New World. Aldous Huxley. Science fiction novel with a title from The Tempest. ’O brave new world that hath such creatures in’t!’ Plot revolves around drugging the populace to keep them from noticing a totalitarian regime headed by a charismatic psycho named Mustapha Monde? No? Dang, where’s Todd when I need him—”
“Alphas, betas, and gammas,” Falkner said, remembering the social ranks in the book, and was rewarded with a wink as Chaz started on piece number six.
“Victim three,” Brady said. “Jeremy Hansen. Eighteen. A working-class kid, mother dead, father not remarried. Two siblings, attending college on savings and student loans. His girlfriend back home became concerned when he stopped answering her emails, sometime in March. No—”
“—family history of mental illness,” Worth said. “Four and five?”
“Melanie Wosczyna,” Brady said. “Nineteen. Commuter student, local family, worked nights at a doughnut shop. Her father’s an alcoholic. In intermittent recovery, it sounds like. No schizophrenia, though, or family history of major mood disorders. She was found by Campus Security, holed up in the basement of the Fine Arts building in mid-April, hugging her knees and shivering. Sounds like she’s a pretty good candidate for a PTSD case even beforehand. Her dad put her mom in the hospital at least once, and who knows what else went on?”
“I sense a trend,” Falkner said, while Chaz started in on the first of the remaining four slices of meat pizza.
“You should consider doing this professionally,” Brady said, and if Falkner hadn’t been in a position of authority she would have flicked a spitball at him. “Victim number five, Hanson Cape. Age 19. Who is the only vic whose family has money, by the way, which could be a coincidence or could be a significant break in victimology. Mom is an eye surgeon; dad is a patent lawyer.”
“Why’s he going to a state school?”
“He washed out of Lawrence, in Appleton, Wisconsin. His grades were shall we say a little less than exceptional, so he was coming back for a second pass at his freshman year in the hopes of being readmitted to Lawrence as a transfer student later. It sounds like Mr. Cape likes girls, pot, and crew, not necessarily in that order. He attacked a T.A. in his Intro to Drama class in late May. Ten stitches in her face and two broken teeth.”
“Ow.” Worth’s hand pressed her lips in sympathy. “Where’s she?”
“Went home on a leave of absence,” Brady said, checking his notes. “Hope she makes it back.”
“Drug related psychotic break?” Chaz paused to pick a fennel seed from the sausage out of his teeth with a fingernail, while Falkner reminded herself that it wasn’t his fault nobody ever taught him table courtesy.
“Potter’s and Hansen’s families and associates, at least, are confident they weren’t using.”
Worth shrugged. “The parents are always the last to know.”
Brady sharked a third slice of pizza. Chaz looked at him reproachfully, and Brady defended his plate like a lifer. “You got a whole pizza plus a slice!”
Chaz looked at Falkner. “Did you get any of those cinnamon things?”
“In the kitchen,” Falkner said. She couldn’t stand the smell of the icing while trying to eat cheese and tomato sauce.
Chaz rose, collecting his coffee mug and Brady’s water cup. He appeared visibly thicker through the middle, like the family dog after Thanksgiving dinner. As always Falkner wondered if that wasn’t more than a little uncomfortable. “Be right back.”
Falkner glanced at her watch. Thirty seconds or less, she estimated, with amusement. He made it in twenty-three, balancing the box of cinnamon twists under one arm. Brady swiped one of those, too, but spurned the icing; Worth just shook her head. Falkner asked, “Do the victims have anything else in common? Club, major, residence, hobby, peer group?”
“Not from the paper,” Brady said, while Chaz scooped frosting onto a cinnamon stick. “But they’re all disaffected. Lonely, not loners?”
“Easy prey for a charmer,” Chaz said. Worth lowered her chin to her hands to watch him eat. “Charismatic type, manipulative, make you feel like the center of the world. Until you’d do anything for him. We could be looking at a cult.”
There were two cinnamon sticks left in the box. He pointed to them, and Falkner and Brady both shook their heads. Brady, Falkner noticed, had fallen silent too, and was also watching Chaz slowly and methodically alternate sips of coffee and bites of cinnamon twist.
Thirty seconds later, he broke a piece off the last cinnamon stick, tucked it into his mouth, and looked up, from face to face. Dawning worry lit his expression. He froze, and tried to use his coffee to clear his mouth, but the cup was empty again. “What’s wrong?”
Worth shook her head wonderingly, without raising it from the backs of her fingers. “Wow,” she said. “It’s like watching a snake engulf a frog.”
Chaz rolled his eyes and swallowed his mouthful stiffly. His Adam’s apple bobbed hard enough to look like it hurt. “Shut up.”
Worth stood and collected his cup. “I’ll refill your coffee, Python.”
“And I’ll call the rest of the team,” said Brady. “And fill them in on what we have.”

•

“Tell me about schizophrenia,” Hafidha said into her headset, while the fingers of her left hand skimmed fluidly on the scroll wheel of her mouse. “And I’ll tell you about patterns of victim behavior.”
Todd’s voice came crisp and clear over her earpiece. “Reyes or Chaz could give you a better précis.”
“But Reyes is driving you to the interview,” Hafidha answered, reasonably. “And Chaz is eleven hundred and eighty-two miles away, approximate driving distance. So thrill me with your dulcet tones, Duke.”
He snorted. “All right then. I’ll put you on speaker, Hafs. Reyes, correct me if I’m wrong.” He cleared his throat, and continued in professorial tones: “Common to most diagnoses of schizophrenia are a combination of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms. Positive symptoms include what we think of as the defining characteristics of schizophrenia, such as auditory or less commonly visual hallucinations, delusions—especially paranoid ones—and racing thoughts. Negative symptoms reveal a drop in functionality, such as apathy, flattened affect, poverty of speech, increasing inability to navigate social situations, catatonia. In addition, although this is not yet considered diagnostic, the schizophrenic shows cognitive impairment, such as disorganized thinking, disorganized speech—”word salad”—failures of memory, and so on.”
“Good,” Reyes said, his voice attenuated by the directional mike.
“I’ve been reading the DSM-IV,” Todd answered, complacently.
“Yes,” Hafidha said. “And you have an MS in psych to go with your law degree, and the master’s in comparative religion.”
“I do? Damned senile dementia. Who can remember these things? Where was I?”
“Reading the DSM-IV.”
“Right. Also, anecdotally, schizophrenics may abruptly drop a lot of weight, in part because they may not eat, and in part because—”
“An amped-up brain burns through glucose like whoa,” Hafidha said, taking a bite out of a Ring Ding. Hafidha ’the human tapeworm’ Gates. If I ever get tired of cop work, I can go into hot dog eating contests. “Maybe he’s trying to turn them into jammers?”
“Jammers?”
“Anomaloids,” she explained, reluctantly, sliding the ridiculous word out long and droopy. “Gammas.”
She had said it flippantly, but the implication settled in on Todd’s thoughtful silence. “Think you could?” he said, when she’d had plenty of time to frown at the other half of the Ring Ding and set it back on the wrapper with its doomed twin.
“Make a gamma? It makes me queasy to think about it. How much does a gamma brain scan look like a schizophrenic one?”
Reyes grunted noncommittally, which Hafidha took to mean, Some.
Todd changed the subject, because Todd did things like that. Unless he was conducting an interview, in which case, he only changed the subject to come back at you from a different angle. “What have you got on the school records and police blotter, Hafs?”
She rolled the mouse wheel again. “Nothing conclusive. Nothing coming up colors. If there’s a sixth vic, I’m not finding them, and it’s not like college students, even freshmen, have daily homework assignments we could track. I placed a couple of calls and emails to professors, though, and it does seem that each victim’s class attendance dropped off for a week or so before he or she cracked. That’s—what was your word, Duke?—anecdotal, though.”
“Right,” Reyes said. “So what do college freshmen do?”
“Try to find a community,” Todd answered, promptly. “Look for mentors and friends. Find places to hang out.”
“Join clubs,” Hafidha said, and felt the click. “Don’t even say it, I’m on it already. The thing is, if they’d each just joined some club before It happened to them, they might not be in the computerized membership lists.”
“Legwork, Hafs? My heart bleeds.”
“Hah,” she answered. “Look, I’m going to call Lau and tell her to ask about social groups and extracurricular activities, okay?”
“Okay,” Todd said. “I think we’re here, anyway.”
“Hafidha!” Reyes’ voice stopped her, finger hovering over the disconnect.
“Last time I checked.”
“Send the brain scans to Doctor Frost.”
Oh yes. That would be the logical next step, and if Hafidha didn’t tend to class Madeline Frost with the Boogeyman and the Grinch, she would have thought of it herself. She said, “In ša’ Allāh, sahib,” and hit the disconnect.
And then, after a moment to compose herself, during which she put the wounded Ring Ding out of its misery, she bit her thumb in the general direction of Johns Hopkins and hit 666 on her speed dial.

•

Madeline Frost, M.D., Ph.D., bent over a microscope, humming Thelonious Monk to herself as she examined a slide biopsied from a forty-month-old male. Histologically, the tumor was well-circumscribed, firm, and pinkish gray. The cells demonstrated a well-defined pattern of rosettes.
She could confirm a primary diagnosis of medulloblastoma.
It was unlikely the patient would survive to his fourth birthday.
She returned the slides to their case, made a note, straightened, and stripped her gloves. She’d call the oncologist from the phone in her office. She expected the news would come as a disappointment, but not a surprise.
As she was dropping the shed blue nitrile into a red bag, what she thought of as her government phone rang. In addition to her hospital phone and pager, Frost kept a separate cell for calls from the BAU.
She did not own a personal cell phone, and never felt the desire for one. People did not call Frost to chat.
She considered that a minor personal success.
The separate cell was not because of ritual, or because she was superstitious about contamination, or because she felt her work as an oncological pathologist needed psychological separation from her work as a forensic pathologist. It was because the instant the device sounded, she knew which set of rules she was meant to be operating under.
There would be a body, or perhaps several bodies, or perhaps parts of several bodies. They would be dead messily or mysteriously. They would present a perfectly intriguing puzzle, a pattern and a set of particulars to be worked out in detail and presented to the team.
It was challenging and satisfying, a welcome diversion.
Frost was fortunate that the chief pathologist was understanding of her sideline, as understanding as he was of her desire never to deal with a living patient as anything other than slides and specimens. Patients were fine, as long as they arrived in pieces.
Frost knew she was not good for living people, and she suspected that living people were not good for her.
Cancer offended her; it did not care for the rules. But it had its own rules, its own patterns. And Frost was very, very good at detecting those patterns, so others could use them to wage war.
It was not, after all, so different from what Stephen Reyes called the anomaly. That was a sort of cancer too, and it also offended her sense of the way the world ought to work.
She permitted the phone to go to voice mail, however. The call to the oncologist would not take long.
Once she had dispensed with it, leaving him to decide how to break the news and discuss treatment options with the family, she unclipped the silver phone from its hard case at her belt and hit redial without checking the time—one forty-three and seventeen seconds—or glancing at the number.
Hafidha Gates answered on the second ring. “Madeline Frost,” Frost said.
“Check your email,” Agent Gates said, without pleasantries. Frost appreciated that about Gates’ dislike for her. It kept the interactions short. “There’s a .zip file with some brain scans. Can you see what you can tell me about them?”
“I’m checking now. Living brains?”
“Those are the kind we can scan for electrical activity, aren’t they?”
“Not my specialty,” Frost said. She slid behind her desk—she’d made her call from the front side—and began to type one-handed. The phone would take a Bluetooth headset. She ought to purchase one. “But I will have a look... These are diffusion tensor images, which record electrical activity in the white matter of the brain. And Agent Gates? These are green across the frontal cortex. All five of them.”
“Green?”
“Color code. Assuming these are awake images, it indicates depressed levels of activity in the frontal cortex. And there are other—” She almost said anomalous, and checked herself. Clarity above convenience of speech. “—unusual patterns of activity consistent across all five.”
“What does that mean?”
“I’m not qualified to diagnose, Agent Gates—”
“Doctor Frost,” said Gates. “Are you qualified to speculate?”
“It’s consistent with patterns of electrical activity seen in schizophrenics,” she said, assured that Gates would know a speculation from an opinion.
“Gammas?”
“Show increased frontal lobe activity, in the limited sample available. As do you and Doctor Villette, Agent Gates. It’s unmistakable, and this isn’t it.”
“Thank you,” said Agent Gates.
“You are welcome,” said Madeline Frost, because that was what one said to conclude a transaction, and severed the connection.
Act III
As they sat in a cramped observation room in the first of three mental institutions on their schedule for today, Todd flipped his phone closed. “Well, if he’s trying to make gammas, he’s doing it wrong.”
“Small mercies,” Reyes answered, without moving his eyes from the one-way glass they sat behind. Beyond it, curled in an armchair in an interview room, sat Melanie Wosczyna.
She was a tall young woman, hunched now into a spasmed curve, her elbows cramped against her ribcage. She had a long neck and a long nose and a long jaw. The strong architecture of her face made her slack disaffected expression more terrible. Todd thought she should have been working on smile lines by thirty. Over her pallor, her complexion was olive. Fluffy-curly brown hair was matted flat on one side, and her right hand twitched convulsively, first two fingers and thumb pressed together and jerking like the beak of a hungry bird.
Todd would have touched Reyes’ elbow, but Reyes had already seen it. “Come on,” he said, standing, and Todd fell in behind him, making his sure his footsteps didn’t fall in the same rhythm. A whole different playbook with a victim than with a suspect. Here, they came as potential rescuers. As friends. Not to intimidate.
Melanie was medicated. She didn’t look up as they entered, but her hand jittered faster. Todd knew his part in the scenario; he was the supportive observer. ’Deferential, glad to be of use, politic, cautious, and meticulous.’ A battered couch stood against the wall, perpendicular to the desk and armchair. Todd assumed it, while Reyes moved across the small room silently to the knotted-up girl in the battered, burnt-orange chair.
Todd found himself wondering, as he often did, if institutions such as this one chose their furnishings with an eye towards repeat business. He had an uneasy Socialist inkling that when they reached the private institution where Hanson Cape was being cared for, they would find more appealing surroundings.
Reyes, with every appearance of unselfconsciousness, dropped a knee and crouched beside the victim’s chair. “Hey, Melanie,” he said, in conversational tones. “I’m Stephen. How are you?”
Not Agent Reyes. Not Doctor Reyes. No, softer and more oblique, an avuncular approach. This was the girl whose father was a likely-abusive binge drunk; Todd watched with respect as Reyes made himself seem small and soft and positioned himself so she had an escape, if she wanted it.
She didn’t acknowledge him overtly, but Todd saw the dip of her eyelashes as her gaze slipped sideways. The antipsychotics were having some effect, and so was the Reyes charisma.
Her right hand jittered faster.
“Melanie,” Reyes said, “do you understand me?”
Her mouth opened, and she made a sound that wasn’t quite a wordless complaint, and also wasn’t quite glossolalia. And then she said, with soft absolute clarity, “It’s the rats.”
“Melanie?”
“I can hear the rats underground. It smells like a ghost train. Can you smell it? And then there were cigarettes.”
Not exactly word salad, either. But when Reyes gave Todd a tight sharp glance over his shoulder, Todd nodded. Disorganized thinking, loose or disassociated chains of speech. As if the subject were having difficulty stringing together coherent logic.
A check mark in the box.
In the meantime, Melanie was staring at Reyes as if she were absolutely captivated by whatever he might choose to impart.
Reyes looked her calmly in the eye and asked, “What are the rats saying?”
Melanie shook her head, jerky as a broken toy. “Baker, baker,” she said, voice unresonant. A crushed guitar. “Is that your girl? Think she’ll wait? We’ll get you home. Hang on. Hang on.”
Todd put his fingers to his mouth. Again—or still—with her hand. The motion, distressingly familiar.
“The rats are saying, ’baker?’” Reyes reached out and lifted her left hand, which was not moving in sympathy with the right. She looked at where he touched her—stared at it—but did not draw her hand away.
Todd was reminded of a seductive cult leader he’d known once, among whose disciples he’d lived, briefly and under cover. Reyes had that same charisma when he wanted it, that way of looking at you like you were the only important person on earth and the center of his world.
“I don’t understand rat,” she said. “It’s a language I don’t know. But they’re talking about me down there. They got baker. They got clement. The ghosts need me. To tell their stories. Nobody cares about the ghosts. Nobody wants to tell their stories. They have to hear. It’s for their own good.”
Reyes rocked back, allowing her hand to drop back to her knee. Hallucinating schizophrenics not infrequently heard voices, or received strange instructions in code.
Todd hadn’t heard of one hallucinating languages she didn’t understand. Usually, under schizophrenic patterning, everything made sense. Too much sense, terrible towering inescapable inexorable sense.
“There’s more death than on the wall,” she said. “Plenty came home dead, just walking. The kids ran through fire. Right through it. And kept running. Burning. Baker, clement, mack. I fell off the wall. And all the King’s horses.”
Speaking of sense. She made sense, after a fashion. That was a terribly consistent stream of consciousness, when you got right down to it. And okay, she was medicated; she should be able to pull it together. But there was something about the pattern of what she was saying.
“If you crawl in a grave,” Melanie said, “you come out dead the other side.”
Todd concentrated on the motions of her hand, trying to isolate. No. It wasn’t the motion of the hand. It was the motion of the fingers.
“Reyes,” he said. “Look at her hand.”
Reyes looked. “Give her your pen.”
“Great,” Todd said. “Let’s provide the psychotic with a weapon.” He pulled the green disposable roller ball from his jacket pocket and added his reporter’s notebook, from the same supply that Brady had recently started filching from. In a moment, they had set up Melanie with both the writing implement and the writing surface, and she was staring at the page as if she meant to eat it. Then she looked away, eyes snapped up as if sighting on the horizon. And her hand began to move as if she had no idea it was tracing letters.
Baker, she wrote painstakingly. Clemente. Mac.
“Automatic writing,” Todd said.
“Names,” Reyes said, looking at him. “Names.”
When it struck Todd, it hit like a lightning bolt, so hot and shocking he could not believe it had taken him that long. His hands went cold; the four walls of the room wobbled woozily as he pushed himself to his feet.
“Names on a wall,” he said, and shook his head. “Names on the Wall.”
“The Vietnam Memorial.” Reyes scrubbed a hand across the tight curls of his receding hair. “And one that fell off it.”
“Rats in tunnels.” Todd bit off the words. “Speaking a language you don’t know.”
“Jesus.” Reyes rubbed his mouth. “So why is a teenaged girl having post-traumatic flashbacks to Vietnam?”
“I don’t know.”
She looked up at Todd and blinked, clear hazel eyes, affectless expression. “Don’t you remember?” she said. “You were there.”

•

Todd could still taste that bile in the hall, ten minutes later. “Do we check the rest?”
Reyes nodded. “Make sure of the pattern. Oh, and get on the horn to Hafidha—”
“Baker, Clemente, Mac.” Todd couldn’t help but contrast the tenderness Reyes showed the victim with his current brusqueness, and wonder which was the lie. “MacDonald? MacAllister? MacLeod? Four Marines on a fireteam.”
“Who’s the fourth one?”
“Yeah,” Todd answered. “I was wondering that myself.”

•

“Right,” Hafidha said into the phone, grateful that Reyes could not see her roll her eyes. “Yeah, two and a half names, all maybe in the same squad in the ’Nam. All maybe KIA. You need the other name and a half? Well, Kemo Sabe, I’m afraid we have a little problem here. No, the campus network is down. Yes, even a miracle worker needs a network. I’ll call Worth and get Quantico on it, though. It’s Friday night, Il Professore, how long do you think it’s going to take?”

•

Nikki Lau was really good at the part with the grieving friends and families. She had a knack for it, a gift as absolute as Falkner’s perfect pitch or Madeline Frost’s time sense accurate to the second.
Being good at it, doing it all the time, didn’t make it any less awful.
When she walked back into Hafidha’s appropriated office, toting a short ton of Chinese takeout, she must have been showing it, because Reyes, of all people, grunted a greeting and pulled the box out of her arms. Lau stood inside the doorway, chafing her arms, trying to shake off an unseasonable chill. “I hope I didn’t get too much,” she said. “No Chaz.”
“You have me,” Hafidha answered brightly, snagging a tray of General Tso’s chicken and a carton of rice right-handed while she grabbed up chopsticks with the left. “Paper plate?”
Reyes ducked out into the lounge and came back with Todd while Lau pulled plates from under the pile. She watched Hafidha and the other two scraping food out of containers and folded her arms across her chest. She didn’t have any appetite of her own, though Hafidha was already on her second helping.
Lau startled when Todd put a plate of rice and Buddha’s Delight in her hands, the partially-missing fingers folded under automatically. He hid it better than James Doohan: she’d known him six months before she’d realized he was maimed, and when she asked about it he’d told some improbable Vonnegutesque story about following a girl who didn’t love him to a communal farm in New Hampshire, and nearly freezing and/or starving to death the first and only winter. “Mangia,” he said. “Tea?”
“Yikes, yes,” she said. He spun a chair for her; she sank into it, and balanced the plate on her knees. Once she started shoveling rice and bean sprouts and bamboo shoots and bell pepper and tofu and cornstarch sauce into her mouth, she almost couldn’t stop to accept the tea cup. She realized she was shivering, cold as if she’d managed to get sunburned, but the tea helped.
“You know,” Hafidha said, around a mouthful of fried animal protein, “we have an excuse for the blood sugar crashies. What happened to you?”
“Three victim family interviews and four friends in six hours,” Lau answered. She realized she was talking with her mouth full, chewed, and swallowed. “I couldn’t eat.”
“It’s easier when they’re dead,” Reyes said, between bites of spring roll. “What did you learn?”
She’d gotten around another mouthful of broccoli and tofu in the meantime. This time, she had recovered herself enough to hold up her hand and stall for time while she swallowed. “Nothing holds across the board,” she said. “No consistent clubs or interests or sports. There’s just one thing that, well, it’s not exactly a consistency, but it’s an echo. Of sorts. Two of the victims, Wosczyna and Gooding, had recently been victimized in other ways. Gooding got mugged at knifepoint on Spring Break in Fort Lauderdale, and Wosczyna had her car broken into, her laptop and some other things stolen.”
“Somebody could have tracked her through the laptop,” Hafidha said. She reached out sideways and patted her own machine, which sat quietly generating fractal screensavers.
“Hafidha,” Reyes said, “check if the other victims were recent complainants in any kind of police report, would you?”
Her eyebrows went up, and her plate went down. She spun her chair around, fingers flying. “Argh. Dammit, boss, the network’s still down. Let me try the PC...” She pushed her laptop aside and pulled the flimsy keyboard and mouse of the local Windows machine over with a discernable grimace. “Nope, nothing. I guess it’s the old-fashioned way.”
She snagged the phone off the desk, pulled a number two Ticonderoga pencil out of her braids, and began pushing buttons with the eraser, mouthing “They had better not assume I’m your secretary” at Reyes while she did.
Todd, Lau noticed, had stopped eating his spring roll. Reyes obviously noticed too, because he was staring at Todd, waiting for him to speak.
“Flyer,” he said, as if he had been searching his memory banks for the word, and Reyes’ eyes went wide. He stood up, set his plate aside, and barreled out of the dark cramped little room.
Hafidha hung up the phone and said, “All five of them. And before you ask, no, the DOD has not come through with that list of names yet.”
Lau stood up to go after Reyes, but Todd held up a hand. “He’s coming right back.”
And so he was, wearing a single latex glove, a sheet of pale purple paper in the hand it covered. “Bag.”
Lau, who had already set her food aside, produced one, and held it open until Reyes sealed up the flyer and two push pins and labeled the bag in indelible marker. He handed it to her, and she turned it around and read what was printed on the front.

BE AFRAID NO MORE
Practical self-defense
FOR EVERYONE
Seeing is believing
NO GIMMICKS
Milo Bail Student Center
Room 114
EVERY FRIDAY
7:00 PM

“That’s next door,” said Hafidha, craning over Lau’s shoulder.
Lau checked her watch. 8:18.
Todd was reaching for his jacket, Hafidha for her reinforced laptop case. Reyes was already out the door.

•

The four of them jogged in two rows, but didn’t quite break into a run. Hafidha’s sidearm bounced against her hip; the rest of her gear counterweighted it on the other side. The laptop swung with every stride, and adrenaline buzzed in her ears.
She’d missed this, and she wouldn’t admit she missed it. Not in front of Reyes, who’d given her a place when developments beyond her control had converted her from an asset to the Secret Service to the sort of person adjudged a liability.
Most of the time, she had a pretty good line of patter in convincing herself that her new job and her new gifts made up for what they’d cost her: a job she’d loved, a normal life expectancy, reasonable grocery bills, and a guy who couldn’t handle it when his lover started seeing and doing things other people didn’t.
Most of the time.
The Milo Bail Student Center was a geometric concrete structure in the brutalist style, surrounded in the long north latitude summer evening by strolling and rough-housing undergrads. “We can’t get into guns drawn here,” Todd said, with a glance over his shoulder.
“No,” Reyes answered, which might mean, yes, you’re right, we can’t have a shootout here, and might mean thank you, I have considered your objections and dismissed them. Todd jerked his head straight and patted his holstered sidearm. He didn’t pop the snap, though.
Hafidha kept her own hands well away from the paddle holster of her Glock. “Do we call campus security?”
Reyes shook his head as if Hafidha should have known better than to ask. Stephen Reyes? El Generalissimo? Share authority? He said, “In here.”
Todd was last through the door, glancing over his shoulder before he followed, covering their backs. Brady might insist on being the last man in line, but whether he was there or not, Hafidha appreciated that nobody got on their tail unnoticed while Todd was on the job.
As he caught up with them in the corridor, he said, “Guys, if this is a Vietnam vet targeting college students, and he’s arranged a mentoring relationship with them, then based on the language in his flyer I think we need to consider the scenario Chaz presented, and be prepared for a charismatic leader situation.”
“Charismatic leader?” Hafidha asked.
“Cult,” Reyes said. “We have to get him away from the kids.”
“Or?”
“Or they might sacrifice themselves to protect him. He will certainly be willing to sacrifice them.” Todd’s face was paper-colored, his lips bloodless.
“I heard Falkner was at Waco,” Lau said, voice taut.
Todd nodded. “You heard right. You ever hear of a place called Jonestown, Guyana?”
Hafidha and Lau both nodded. Before her time, but not forgotten; the site of a mass murder/suicide of almost a thousand followers of the charismatic leader, Jim Jones. Hafidha resolved to google it up when she had Internet access again, and see if she could figure out what exactly was making Todd look like a binge drinker with room-spins. “You’re saying he’s brainwashed them.”
“Common misconception,” Reyes said. “It’s not really brainwashing, not in the Hollywood sense. It’s the imposition of a communal reality. Creating a sense of belonging. In-group versus out-group. Manipulation of the bonding impulse. Everybody wants to feel chosen.”
Todd put a hand on Reyes’ arm. “Remember,” he said. “They’re just a bunch of stupid kids.”

•

When they came down the hall, Reyes knew he was already too late. Students stood in clusters outside room 114, chatting in groups of three or four. He took the nearest—a blond boy, five-eleven, one-eighty, gay, probably a Chemistry major by the caffeine molecule on his t-shirt—by the sleeve and turned him away from his boyfriend, ready for whatever reaction might follow. The kid dropped effortlessly into a balanced pose, his left hand moving to intercept an anticipated blow, the right turning to knock Reyes’ left hand away.
Reyes, prepared, stepped back before the kid made contact. Whatever else, the potential UNSUB was teaching his students to take care of themselves.
Reyes asked, “Is the instructor still here?”
“Jim?” The boy blinked gray-blue eyes. “No, he went that way.” He pointed down the hall. “With the advanced students. The wheelchair ramp, but he left ten—”
Reyes took off running, his team strung out behind him, Hafidha gaining with every stride of her long legs and the rest holding position. Undergrads flattened themselves against the corridor walls as Reyes bawled Coming through! Coming through!
Todd was yelling something too, maybe make a hole, while the women saved their breath for running. It didn’t matter. When they reached the sidewalk, there was no one in sight except undergrads, moving industriously in the narrow space between red brick buildings. Evening was drawing up, a gray northern lengthening of the shadows.
“Wheelchair ramp,” Reyes said, and Lau turned around and looked at it.
She said, “The self-defense instructor is in a wheelchair?”
“Vets,” Todd said, shoving his left hand into his pants pocket in something Reyes thought was an unconscious gesture, “wind up missing a lot of body parts.”
Reyes rocked on feet bruised sore from running on pavement in dress shoes. “Hafidha, I need to know who reserved that room—”
She already had her cell to her ear. She held up one finger, mumbling into the mouthpiece, and then said “Thank you” in a tone that didn’t mean thank you at all and shook her head. “Network,” she said, thumbing the red button, frustration dripping from every word. “Friday night at supper time. Nebraska.” That last with infinite bitterness, though Reyes would wager that the IT departments of plenty of east coast colleges wouldn’t have acquitted themselves any better. “I’ll call Worth, one sec, and see if she has that squad roster for us yet—Daph, any luck? Oh, for the love of Mike. Hey, can you transfer me? No, I’ll handle it. No, honey, you’re doing fine, they just think they can walk on you because you aren’t me. Transfer, please?”
What followed was one of the most polite ass-reamings Stephen Reyes had ever made it his pleasure to hear. By the time Hafidha was done, even Todd was looking at her with respect, and Lau had dilated pupils.
“Macgillivray,” she said, finally, after a listening pause. “And the fourth fireteam member was James Cauldwell.”
“James,” said Lau.
Reyes said, “Jim.”
Hafidha continued relaying: “All members of the 258th Marine Brigade; all saw service in Vietnam 1971-1972. The first three killed, the fourth critically wounded in April of 1972. Weren’t we out of Vietnam by then?”
“Easter Offensive?” Reyes asked, looking at Todd.
Todd nodded. “Military advisors.”
Hafidha looked between them. “I wasn’t born yet,” she said. “Okay, I have Quantico searching for a local address for Cauldwell. And—nothing. Wanna bet he’s using an alias?”
“No bet,” Reyes said. He turned, began to pace. “I cannot believe he’s out there somewhere with potential vics, and we’re stuck here at the mercy of a flaky network.”
“It’s like those nightmares where you’re running up stairs ahead of the monster,” Hafidha said.
Reyes whirled at the end of an arc, shook his head. “All right, next step. Todd, Lau. Head back in and interview as many students as possible. Maybe one of them knows where he takes the kids.”
Todd and Lau nodded and withdrew. Todd still had his maimed hand fisted in his pants pocket. Reyes thought, Someday, Solomon, I will determine which of your stories are truth, and which are fiction.
“I’ve got another idea,” Hafidha said, unlimbering her laptop. “This is a college campus. Somebody’s got a wildcat Wi-Fi set up. And I saw warchalk on the way in.”
“Warchalk?”
Hafidha plumped down on the concrete where the building would cast a shadow over her screen, “Quoth Wikipedia, warchalking is: ’the drawing of symbols in public places to advertise an open Wi-Fi wireless network.’ As opposed to those non-Wi-Fi wireless networks. They’re hobo signs for geeks. Let me see what I can find.”
Act IV
Nothing, at first, though Hafidha was giving herself a headache from grinding her teeth. It had to be out there, though; she could see the paired semicircles from where she sat, chalked in yellow under a protective overhang, and she needed a network that bad. “Come on, baby,” she said, petting the contact pad, ignoring the grumbles of her gastric system. “Find it.”
Reyes leaned over her shoulder as if fascinated, even though she wasn’t doing anything interesting. Hafidha grimaced and scooted a little left, closer to the symbol. If the Wi-Fi node ran off the campus network, she was hosed.
Somebody’s baby’s mind was at stake. She could not afford to be hosed.
Lau trotted back down the steps, vaulting the rail rather than making the turn. “Todd is getting the names of the five students he took with. At absolute worst we can contact families, get cell numbers, and start calling them. Get APBs out on their cars, if they didn’t all travel in the same vehicle.”
“Six in a single car?” Hafidha asked, without raising her eyes from the screen.
“Wheelchair,” Reyes said. “Van.”
Hafidha took a deep breath, shifted her buttocks again, let her fingertips hover over the keys, and prayed. Please just two bars of signal. Please. Just two bars—
As if someone had heard her, or that last scooch to the left had made the difference, blue dots flickered into existence at the bottom of the screen. Two, three, five glorious bars. “Hah!” she said. “Okay, I have it. Ten seconds.”
In fact, the entire network seemed to have risen from the grave, and Hafidha silently retracted everything mean she had said about the IT department of the University of Nebraska, Omaha. She logged in, flipped to student activities, and in under six seconds had the name of the student organization that had reserved the room. And the names of its officers. And—
“James Baker,” she said, and Reyes slapped his forehead.
“God damn,” he said. “He’s using the name of one of his buddies. Okay, check all four names, and all potential combinations for local addresses. Lau—”
But she had already vanished inside to fetch Todd.
In the car, on the way to Baker né Cauldwell’s address, Hafidha’s laptop maintained perfect signal, and—sitting in the back seat, typing away like a mad thing while Reyes drove—she shook her head at the miracle. Reyes was muttering something into his headset. Lau stared out the rear passenger-side window with stern concentration.
Todd, on the horn to one of Reyes’ carefully selected sympathetic federal judges, was explaining that they were enroute to the home of a suspect linked to several victims whose families were prepared to swear they had been abused into emotional breakdowns, and would she please be so kind as to have her secretary fax the warrant to this number so Hafidha could print it out en route, yes I know it’s Friday night, sorry my cell got dropped, yes that was me, I called back, witnesses place him in the company of five young people right now and there may be civilians in danger in the house as we speak, please send it on? Oh, thank you.
“What would we do without collusion?” Lau asked.
Reyes snorted through his nose.
“Uck,” Todd said, staring at his closed phone, a muscle twitching in the corner of his jaw. “I kind of miss the Fourth Amendment.”
“I am become Shiva, Destroyer of Worlds,” Hafidha said, sympathetically. “El Jefe, honey, do we want to send Omaha PD on ahead?” Her stomach rumbled again. She rubbed it, mourning the half-eaten dinner back at the university. She was still hungry enough to feel dizzy, and she’d gone through her stash of almonds and peanut butter crackers already.
Damned beta metabolism. It sounded like fun until you had to live with it.
“No,” Reyes said. “I don’t want to send in a bunch of uninformed, unsupervised alphas when this could go cattywumpus in ways we can’t begin to articulate. Tactical can meet us at the house. We go in together.”
“Six of them,” she reminded, and touched her gun. “Four of us.”
“One of them,” Reyes said. “Five potential hostages. Four of us.”
She checked the laptop again, and the GPS. “Five minutes inbound. I wish Brady were here. Okay, more info. Cauldwell, or Baker, has been teaching that self-defense class for seventeen years. Under an assumed name the whole time. Go figure.”
“Maybe he was hiding from the government,” Todd said, dryly. “He’s not registered with the local VA.”
“He must have converted over the summer. Oh. Here. Isn’t this interesting. Jessica Cauldwell. Age 34. Local resident. UNO graduate, actually. Raped and murdered in her home in June of last year—”
“His daughter?” Lau asked, incredulous. “Please, tell me he didn’t.”
“No,” Hafidha said, and Lau let out a long shuddering breath. “They caught a perp, DNA match. Actually, the BAU were involved; she was his third vic. But none of this makes any sense. Why was he using an alias seventeen years before he apparently converted?”
Reyes said, “He was concealing his identity from his daughter. I bet you’ll find he started teaching that self-defense class around the time she matriculated. He wanted to be close enough to keep an eye on her, and she didn’t know him and had some reason to think she didn’t want to know him. Mom unhappy about getting half a husband back from the war?”
“I won’t take that bet,” said Todd, shoulders rising around his ears.
Hafidha’s stomach clenched. “God, does anybody have a candy bar? I’ll pay back with interest.”
Todd reached back into the pocket where he’d stowed the cell phone, and came up with a Twix. He handed it to her diagonally across the car with his left hand. Hafidha snatched the candy. Sol had started the wrapper for her, which was the only reason she could manage it with shaking fingers. She shoved chocolate-coated cookie twigs into her mouth, barely chewing, smearing her fingers and face like a child’s. “God, not enough. Send peanuts. Anything.”
When she lifted her head, she caught sight of Reyes’ steady gaze in the mirror. “Doctor Stephen, are you driving?”
“Hafidha,” he answered, “what on earth are you using as a Wi-Fi spot?”
“It’s the same Wi-Fi spot.”
“For the last fifteen miles?”
Hafidha’s racing thoughts crashed like the Three Stooges coming up to a flight of stairs. Her hands reached for the keyboard, jerked back, fell to the sides. “Oh,” she said, in a very little voice. “Campus network. City network? Omaha have municipal Wi-Fi?”
“I just got off the phone with President Woodward,” Reyes said. “He mentioned that the university network is still down. How are you feeling back there, Hafidha?”
Oh god. A catastrophic wave of understanding shook her. She grabbed the lid of the laptop and pulled it nearly shut without powering the machine down.
Reyes’ eyes were still seeking hers in the mirror, and how the hell was he driving the car? But he didn’t pull over, and he didn’t turn around.
It was, on one level, a tremendous display of trust. His back was to her. She was sitting immediately behind him, and even though Lau and Todd had turned to stare, neither one had a weapon in hand.
“I feel like me?” He watched her in the mirror, silent. Waiting for what she’d say next. “Would I know, if—?”
“I don’t know,” Reyes said. “What do you think is going on?”
“Breakthrough,” she said, looking down at the logo on the lid of the laptop on her knees, jammed against the back of his seat. The printer, between her feet, began to chatter. “I’m manifesting. A real manifestation, not a half-assed one like seeing colors. An external ability.”
“Hafs,” Lau said, back against the passenger door. Todd’s hand was inside his jacket. She didn’t blame them at all.
She said, “The network is me.”
“I concur,” Reyes answered. And then he glanced sideways at Todd, and continued, “This could be a normal stage of the beta cycle, okay? Don’t freak yourself out.”
“Maestro?”
“Yeah?”
She held up her hand. Her big silver ring spun loosely on her finger. Her watchband drooped from her wrist. “I’m really, really hungry, man.”
“Okay.” He turned down a side street. Reflexively, Hafidha checked the GPS. They were still headed the right way. “We’re on a timeline, here. I need you. If we don’t stop, are you going to eat anybody in the car?”
Not a joke. Not given some of the things they’d seen over the years. Rather, a perfectly reasonable request for vital information. The fact that they had a job where that was a perfectly reasonable request for vital information notwithstanding.
Hafidha’s hands tightened convulsively on the edges of the laptop. “No. I think I can survive without resorting to cannibalism. Lau, don’t think I didn’t see you reach for that gun—”
“Actually,” Lau said, and handed Hafidha two fortune cookies, palmed from her pocket. She must have shoved them there on the way out the door.
“Marry me,” Hafidha said, and ripped the first one out of the wrapper.
“Eat fast,” Reyes ordered, pulling the purple Intrepid to the curb in a semi-rural residential neighborhood on the outskirts of town. Hafidha glimpsed cornfields through the cottonwood trees behind the ranch-style houses. “We’re here. Unless you need to wait in the car.”
“Not on your life,” Hafidha said, through crumbs. “Sorry, chief.” In her best Max Smart. He was letting her come with them?
Yes, of course. Where the team could keep an eye on her. Where the guns were, if everything went wrong.
Reyes was a gambler at heart. And you never won big unless you risked big. That was the way the game was rigged.
Hafidha tore the warrant off the printer one-handed. The appropriate house was immediately obvious: half a block down the street, and the only one with a van with handicapped plates in the driveway, and a wheelchair ramp up to the front door.
“Do we go hard?”
“He’s a cornered gamma,” Reyes said, as two tactical vans pulled up behind them. “What do you think?”
All the shades in the unassuming white ranch were drawn, and behind them, all the lamps in every room seemed lit. In a movie, there might have been a shadow cast against the curtains to tell them where the bad guy was. But all they had was speed and ten SWAT guys in black armor and face masks.
Lau and Reyes went down the street informing the residents to bring their kids and pets inside, though Hafidha was certain that the instant they turned away, faces would be appearing in every front-facing window.
Doors are not as easy to kick down as they look on TV, and Brady was back in Virginia. But nobody needs melodrama when they have a hooligan tool. Todd retrieved the fireman’s forcible-entry wrecking bar from the trunk while Hafidha was velcroing her body armor on, and the team split up. Half the SWAT group and two Federal agents each front and back.
Hafidha went to the front, with Todd. Reyes watched her walk away through narrowed eyes. She felt it like a pressure coming off her shoulders when he turned away.
It was okay. Duke would keep an eye on her.
Reyes and Lau reported that they were in position at the back door. Todd inserted the claws of the hooligan tool into the crack around the door and twisted it to pop the lock. The doorframe splintered on the bolt, and the panel swung heavily inward. “FBI!” Hafidha shouted. “Federal Agents!”
She swung left as Todd swung right, clearing the living room—all tile floors and plenty of room for a wheelchair—pushing back, the SWAT guys a widening arc behind them. “Clear,” Todd called, and she yelled back an affirmation. A sunporch on her side. Reyes’ voice from the kitchen. And then from across the living room, Todd: “Here, here. Federal Agent! Mister Cauldwell, we have a warrant—”
Hafidha spun, crossed the living room, ducking between SWAT guys to reach Todd, silhouetted in a doorway leading to an empty space beyond. She came up beside him, hard hold, front stance, the Glock locked at the apex of a modified Weaver grip. Todd sidestepped to make room. The two of them filled the door.
This must once have been the den.
Now it was an empty room with a white tile floor. A broad-shouldered double amputee of about sixty, cheekbones bright through his skin above the beard, sat in a manual wheelchair at the far end. A young man knelt beside him. Four other students crouched on the floor between Cauldwell and the door like huddled frogs, pens in their hands, each bent over scattered sheets of the same eight-and-a-half-by-eleven paper that was stacked against each wall. Piles of it, all covered over with handwriting, the paper crumpled and randomly arrayed.
They were writing, each one scribbling away as if oblivious to the SWAT officers and the shouting FBI agents, as if writing—relentlessly, with tongues protruding in concentration—were the only way to stop the end of the world.
The student who knelt by Cauldwell, an Asian boy who looked like he should still be in high school, wrote also. His paper was propped on the armrest of the wheelchair, and he seemed oblivious to the fact that Cauldwell held a Ka-bar fighting knife against his throat, stroking his hair with the other hand.
The room was brilliantly lit by torchieres and a hanging chandelier. Hafidha could see the vacant expressions, the tears shining on the student’s cheeks. The creak of SWAT officers breathing behind her was almost drowned out by the buzz of adrenaline’s ugly, alluring song.
Awful.
She was an awful human being to miss this so much.
She cleared her throat and said, “James Cauldwell. Federal agents. Put down the knife.”
As, beside her, Todd said, “Reyes,” and stepped to the side as Reyes and Lau came up through the SWAT team.
Act V
The children just kept writing. Hafidha had the shot. Reyes told himself he was only worried about the knife. The knife, and five children scratching words on paper. “James Cauldwell?” he said.
“Don’t tell me. You’re from the government and you’re here to help.” Cauldwell stroked the hair of the boy in his lap. He was gray-haired, bearded, his upper body massive from using his arms for everything his legs could no longer do for him. He must have been getting adequate nutrition because he still carried that muscle, though his face had been whittled gaunt by his illness. He had light eyes, framed by a squint, and his button-down shirt was open at the collar.
He looked like Santa Claus.
“James. I’m Stephen Reyes. I’m with the FBI and I need you to put the knife down now, man. Nobody’s died. You haven’t done anything that can’t be fixed.” A patent lie, with five children in mental institutions, but you used what you had. “Nobody has to die. We want to get you some help.” Reyes had three good agents at his back, and a hallway full of SWAT guys. He tipped his head at Hafidha: tall, implacable, a comic-book heroine in her black jeans and ballistic vest and beaded yellow-streaked this-a-way that-a-way braids. “But you should know that my partner here is a very good shot.”
“Bullets,” Cauldwell said. “Who cares?”
Carefully, feeling his way, Reyes slipped his semiautomatic back into the high-impact plastic holster on his left hip. It clicked as it settled into place, and he brought his left hand back up slowly. “Is this how you teach your students to defend themselves?”
Cauldwell lifted the restraining hand from the boy’s hair, but the boy stayed crouched before him, pressing his throat willingly to the blade of Cauldwell’s knife. “I teach them to take care of themselves. I teach them to fight. It’s for their own good. It’s a jungle out there.”
He laughed at his own joke; Reyes schooled himself not to wince at it. “I met one of your students at the college,” Reyes said. “You teach them how to defend themselves, all right. And I met another one of your students at a mental institution. Melanie. What did you teach her?”
“I taught her to remember,” Cauldwell said. He touched the hair of the boy writing beside him. “This is Peter. His parents were refugees. It might have been me that made them refugees. Peter is a medium. His spirit guides put him in touch with the other side.”
“His spirit guides,” Reyes said. “Baker. Clemente. Macgillivray.”
“They can teach you about the jungle. They try protect us all,” Cauldwell said. “But there are too many of us. They would teach you, too.”
Cauldwell used Peter’s name. He personalized him. Not just for Reyes. For himself. “James,” Reyes said. “Listen to me. Put down the knife. You don’t want to hurt Peter. I know you don’t.”
Cauldwell shivered. “Nobody can protect him. You can’t protect him, Stephen Reyes. I’ve tried. I’ve tried to save him.”
Todd and Hafidha still had the door. Lau was right behind them. Reyes gritted his teeth, thought about their line of fire, and said, softly, gently: “The way you couldn’t protect Jessica?”
Cauldwell looked into Reyes’ eyes, and Reyes feels the reach. The touch, the hard clutch, the black-water calm of the anomaly. And then jungle, sweat, heat, swamp, savagery. The way the knife goes into flesh, the scrape on bone and the suck when you pull it free. The burning children. The trickles of red thin blood left behind when you pry loose the leeches. The young refugee women, so emaciated they look like old men. The hard bulge of a fat tick in your ear, filling the canal, too swollen on blood to pry loose in the field.
You can feel the legs wriggling, sometimes.
“Exorcise it,” Cauldwell says. “It’s okay. Give it voice. Give them voice. Exorcise them. Here. I’ll show you. You have to learn, Stephen Reyes. It’s for your own good. You can’t save anyone.”
He raises the black, glittering, enormous pen, brandishes it with a dramatic flourish. A sheet of white paper spreads, waiting, across his lap, ready to be scribed with red irrevocable words.
“No,” Reyes cries, lunging forward, because of course what the gamma has in his hand isn’t a pen—
The loudest sound in the world knocked Stephen Reyes to his knees.

•

The knife rose. Reyes dove, impossibly far. There were still four victims on the floor between him and Cauldwell and the hostage.
Hafidha rolled her finger on the trigger.
Gamma.
She fired once. Twice. Cauldwell’s powerful shoulders bulged as he heaved himself up in the chair, lifting the knife. Thrice. A fourth time. He might be dead already, but four bullets would not stop him. Gamma. Hafidha was in front of Lau, and Reyes lunged up into her line of fire. “Dammit!” Somehow, she stopped the fifth shot. Sent it into the ceiling, upward jerk of her hands. Shit. Not gun safety, man. “REYES!”
Not listening. No, both hands on the gamma’s knife wrist, scrambling over the Asian kid, who was rolling on the floor, being kicked, clutching his pen, jabbing through paper, still writing.
Cauldwell might not have any legs from mid-thigh down, but he had inches on Reyes across the shoulders, and the Kevlar wouldn’t do much against a stab. The gamma tumbled from his wheelchair, pulled Reyes to the floor, rolled atop him. Matte-finished knives don’t glint, but Hafidha swore the thing winked wickedly as Cauldwell reared back, kneeling on his stumps, broke Reyes’ grip on his wrist. Cauldwell’s blood fountained with every breath.
One shot, Hafidha thought, as Todd stepped up beside her.
She took a hard grip on the butt of her pistol, dropped her gaze to the front sight, and pressed off one more as Todd’s gun roared on her right.
The gamma jerked. The knife didn’t fall.
Follow through. Resight. Press. And again. And again. Todd, too. One more. The gamma’s head was a fine red mist now, let’s be honest, but once the adrenaline starts pulling the trigger, the trigger gets pulled. She rattled like shaken paper. It was okay.
One more—
Cauldwell teetered and the last pair of rounds—hers, and Duke’s—caught him square in the chest and knocked him back. The knife in his convulsing hand chinked off the floor.
Reyes rolled to the side and squirmed out from under, pulling his knees up, grimacing behind a mask of blood. His mouth worked. He wouldn’t spit at the crime scene, but Hafidha didn’t blame him for wanting to.
She lowered the firearm, but kept it ready, listening to the last hiss of Cauldwell’s breath through his ruined face. He looked like the autopsy photos of Bugsy Siegel.
“Blood precautions,” Reyes said. “How’s the kid?”
Todd picked his footing through the room like a stag moving through the woods in autumn. He knelt beside the Asian boy, who curled tight, face to knees, shoulders shaking with panicked breath. Gently, he prised the pen from the young man’s fingers.
No response.
“He’s stopped writing.” Todd laid the pen back down beside his hand.

•

This time, Todd was waiting when she came in. Not behind the desk, in the alpha-wolf chair, or in the nappy burnt orange lounger... but seated leaning forward on the ratty sofa beside the door. She didn’t see him at first; she expected the visitor to have taken the position of power, and she scanned the far side of the room, her forehead wrinkling.
“Melanie,” he said. Softly, so she didn’t jump.
The antipsychotics were probably making her thick-headed anyway, and then there was the schizophrenic suppression of affect. Her eyes were glazed, the blink-rate too slow. But, eventually, she focused on him.
“Sit down?” he said.
She nodded. He expected her to share the couch, but she plunked down on the floor.
Oh, no. I wonder where I’ve seen that before?
He scooted off the couch and landed crosslegged in front of her, corduroy binding his thighs. “I just came to see how you were doing. I’m—”
“Agent Todd,” she said. “I remember you. You’re one of the FBI guys.”
He nodded.
She said, “My mom brought me newspaper clippings. She said Jim used drugs to make us see things that weren’t real?”
Todd looked down at his hands, at the hangnail on his right thumb. “We’re not exactly sure how it worked.”
“I liked him.” She closed her eyes. “He was nice to me. Not like—”
Yeah, kid. Todd wanted to reach out and put a hand on her shoulder, but that would be inappropriate. Sorry your surrogate father-figure turned out to be a monster, too. And it wouldn’t help her at all for him to tell her it wasn’t Cauldwell’s fault. Go ahead and hate him for a while. It makes it easier. “It wasn’t your fault,” Todd said.
Sometimes, all you can offer is absolution.
She licked cracked lips. Her eyes stayed down. “The doctor says I’m making progress. But I can still feel—”
The heat. The brush of leaves against your face. The way your foot slips in mud inside a waterlogged boot.
“He broke my life,” she said. “I want it back. I want it—”
“Hey,” Todd said. “Melanie. Look at me.”
She lifted her chin.
“It’s like a car wreck, okay? It happened. You got hurt. But the war is over, kiddo. You made it through. Everything is going to be okay now.”
“Really?”
And Todd took a breath and smiled, and lied like a fox. She’d figure it out eventually, the lie and the reasons for it, after she didn’t need so badly to believe it anymore. “Really. It just takes time, is all.”

•

Upon due consideration, Chaz concluded that the real reason Reyes usually didn’t bring Hafidha into the field was that they missed her too much during the administrative leave, should she happen to shoot somebody. Todd was out too, of course, also due back today. And Worth, Brady, Falkner, and Lau were on a case in Seattle, leaving Chaz and Reyes to mind the ranch, keep the home fires burning, and wrangle clichés.
Fortunately, so far the field team had been getting by on old fashioned street-pounding, but Chaz had been quietly terrified that the call would come in for some heavy database herding and he’d be the only one available to do it. So when somebody said from the doorway, “Hey, Platypus, get out of my chair,” he almost crowed with joy.
Instead, he blanked and locked the screens—reflexively: Falkner was a bit of a martinet about it and Hafs was worse—rose awkwardly and said, “Hey! It’s Eliot Ness! There’s still six doughnuts in the kitchen.”
She tipped her head and smiled. “You wrote it on your calendar.”
He tapped his forehead. And went to fetch her food.
The doughnuts delivered, Chaz leaned a hip against the desk a few feet from where Hafidha sat and watched her eat the first two. “How did it go with Dad?”
She shrugged, and washed down jelly doughnut with a swallow of milk. “I think Il Dottore would like to put a tracking collar on me, and maybe a microchip in my butt so they know where to ship me home to if I stray. But since I’ve spent the last three weeks jumping through every hoop he can devise, my veto held. Did we figure out the mechanism in the Omaha case?”
“It was catharsis,” he said, when her mouth was full of doughnut again. “They thought he was teaching them to contact spirits. But he was just channeling his own trauma through them, over and over again. Slamming neurons to induce hallucinations. Retraining their brains to operate like the minds of schizophrenics. And one by one, they were going mad.”
“We say ’experiencing a psychotic break,’” Hafidha said, swilling coffee.
Chaz took a deep breath. “How much of it do you think was the anomaly, and how much was Vietnam, and how much was just James Cauldwell?”
She stared, and he backtracked hastily.
“You did the right thing,” he said. “I didn’t mean to suggest otherwise. You doing better on the food front?”
She lifted her chin, still staring. He saw it from his peripheral vision, because he wasn’t looking at her directly. “Starting to gain some weight back,” she said. “There were a couple of bad days there. I honestly couldn’t eat enough to keep up. You’re worried. About you.”
“Well, duh.” He looked at his wristwatch. “Breakthrough. It’s scary.”
She shrugged. She was still staring, so he figured he might as well stop faking inattention. When his eyes slid over to her, she said, “Well, except for the part where I did it without even noticing. Seriously. It’s a great toy, Chaz. I have wireless. Everywhere. And hey, look at this!”
She turned to the computers. She wiggled her left hand as if on the mouse. Screens lit up, data scrolled.
Chaz felt his pupils dilate. “I am totally sick with envy, you know.”
“I know,” she said. “I would be too. That’s why I’m buying you lunch today.”
“What?”
“I just cancelled my broadband, smarty-boy. I’ve got thirty-nine bucks a month I’ve got to blow on something, and my closet’s already full of shoes.”
It was hard to stay jealous around somebody so damned pleased to be themselves. “You really like this, don’t you?”
“I really, really do.” There was an edge on it, though. A kind of melancholy. Chaz was a good enough profiler to catch it when it hit him between the eyes.
And he was a good enough profiler to defuse it, too. “Man, why do you get all the good stuff? If I got a manifestation, it would probably be miraculous projectile vomiting.” His voice wobbled. He hadn’t realized it wasn’t a phrase you could say with a straight face.
“Bah. You have your uses.”
He grinned, but she wasn’t over being half-sad. Her fingers moved, a little twitch, as if she were keyboarding. They never left the arms of her chair. Screen savers blossomed everywhere. She turned and gave him a look. “I liked the field, too,” she said. “I miss the heart-racing thing, sometimes.”
“Even when you wind up shooting somebody?”
Okay, way to go, cowboy. Smooooth. He waited for her face to crumple, for the shakes in her hands. It’s what he would have done.
But she just looked down at them and shook her head. “He was trying to put a knife in Reyes, honey. I feel okay about it, actually.” And then she took a big deep breath and said, “Hey Chaz?”
“Hafs?”
“If... if anything bad happens?” She held up her pinky, crooked. “Promise me you won’t let me do anything like that to anybody, man? You’ll do what you have to? Pinky-swear?”
“You won’t.” He hooked his own pinky around hers, feeling the dry warmth of her skin. He hoped she wouldn’t notice that he hadn’t promised. “Pinky-swear.”
She looked at him for a long time before she nodded and pulled back her hand.
“People,” Chaz said, shaking his head. “You think you know a girl, and she turns out to be a gunslinger.” He was angling for a laugh, and didn’t get it. Dammit, this had not been supposed to be an awkward conversation, all sharp angles and obliques. He swallowed. And then he stepped away from her chair. “Like this thing with the will, and my mom.”
Oh, there it was. The track he’d needed to get around to the thing he had to say, and didn’t know how: You’re not what I thought you were, Hafidha. But it doesn’t matter, because you are still and will always be my friend.
Still, and always. The only person in the world who got it, or ever would.
He could get there from here. He could tell, because she made a circle with one hand and asked, “You going to go to Texas?”
“Eventually.” He shrugged. “In my copious spare time. But yeah, I think I can face it. It’s just a house she used to live in, right?”
“It’s just the place where she grew up,” Hafidha said. She picked up a third doughnut and took a bite, and handed him the fourth. “It worries you.”
“I thought I knew who she was,” he said. “I remember her really well. Nobody in the foster system believed that, you know. They thought I was making things up. And I know—” He shook his head. It took a deep breath to get through the pain trying to lock his throat. “—I know she didn’t leave me on purpose. But that’s the way addiction works. The addiction is more important than anything else, in the end. It’s like cancer. It eats everything it touches. Oh, damn. “
The tension in the muscles of his face made his head ache, all the way around to the back. Hafidha reached out, softly, and touched his hand. “Can’t do that with the wireless in my head,” she said, to make him smile.
He blinked rapidly, and got the stinging in his eyes under control.
She pulled her hand back. “While we’re on the topic, c’mere. Wanna show you something. I got nosy while I was out. One more fucking Minnesota Multimoronic Personality Inventory and I was going to bite somebody. Probably El Jefe. “
Chaz turned to see her screens. The screensaver zipped off and a page of text popped up front and center. It looked like a scanned magazine article, dated early 1978. “’One Thousand In Guyana.’ Solomon Todd. Oh, my.”
“You knew he was a reporter before he was FBI.”
“I didn’t know he was a reporter in fucking Jonestown.”
“Well,” she said. “I guess he got out before.”
“Before,” Chaz echoed. She meant: before nine hundred and nine people died in a mass-murder/suicide of Biblical proportions. Chaz shook his head. “You’d never guess it to look at him, would you?”
Hafidha looked at Chaz, and shook her head, smiling. “No. You’d never guess.” And then she said, very carefully, “You think you understand people, you know? You know what they eat, you know how they take their coffee.” She gestured with the pastry in her hand. “You know what kind of doughnuts they like. So you think you know them. You think you know yourself.”
“Yeah,” Chaz said, understanding. “You think so. And then you don’t. You really don’t.”
He touched her shoulder. She laid her cheek against his knuckles briefly.
He said, “But that’s okay.”

The Living Word

Baltimore, MD, April, 2007.
The woman standing by the crosswalk shoved a flyer at Hafidha. “Have you found Jesus?”
Hafidha stopped. “No.” She held eye contact until the woman—white, middle-aged, suburban upper middle class, not the usual profile for a streetcorner proselytizer—shifted nervously. Then she smiled and took the flyer. “But if I see him, I’ll tell him you’re looking for him.”
She was two blocks away before she looked at the flyer in her hand. Kinko’s made professional-looking flyers possible for the rankest of amateurs, but whoever had made this one had a good eye for graphic design. THE TRUTH IS REVEALED UNTO US, it said. THE LIVING WORD OF GOD WILL SPEAK TO YOU. 7 P.M., EVERY WEDNESDAY. And then an address that was almost certainly a store-front.
Something about it tickled at her bullshit detector. But—photocopy, no love there. She muttered under her breath: “Stupid-ass old-skool ink-on-paper information delivery system.” No seeing pretty colors here, even if this chatty Living Word of God was made of jam.
But then, the world was crammed full of non-anomaloid kooks. Odds were against it. And people didn’t just hand you the start of a case file on a street corner. So, no.
It still tickled.
She’d bet they had an online presence. Hell, her dry cleaner had an online presence. Take maybe five minutes to find ’em. Nobody would miss five minutes out of her otherwise-productive day...

Significant

J. Edgar Hoover Building, Washington, D.C. June 2007
Brady returned from his second coffee pilgrimage of the morning and saw Daphne Worth putting a framed 5x7 prominently on her desk, with the air of one who wanted it to be commented on. “Pretty lady,” Brady said. “Who is she?”
Worth grinned at him, and he knew bravado when he saw it. “Guess.”
Chaz spun his chair around. She obligingly angled the picture so he could see it. “Sister.”
“Chaz honey,” said Hafidha, leaning hip-shot against the divider, “you are not even trying. Daph and that lady are sisters about the same way I’m the long lost twin of Josephine Baker.”
“But Hafidha,” Brady said, “you are the long lost twin of Josephine Baker.”
“You gonna pay good money to see my fan dance?”
“Try again,” Worth said, eyes bright. She was almost bouncing in her chair, nervous but brazening it out. Brady’d given her an out, a distraction, and she’d refused it. Interesting.
“College roommate? Childhood friend?”
Hafidha rolled her eyes and said, drawling the syllables out for maximum effect, “Girlfriend? As in, significant other?”
“Bing bing bing bing bing!” Worth said. “Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner!”
She was scared, but she wasn’t backing down, as if she could make this go well through sheer force of personality, committed to telling the truth with her whole heart. Worth sought the truth like a grail knight. Brady supposed he shouldn’t be surprised she would wear its favor on her sleeve in personal matters as much as in her work. He felt a little hollow. You’re a better man than I am, Gunga Din.
Hafidha must either have known already or have guessed almost at once. She didn’t miss a beat. “What do I win?”
“What do you want?”
“As the long lost twin of Josephine Baker, I want a smooch.”
“Is this sexual harrassment in the workplace?”
“Only if you feel harrassed, Peaches,” Hafidha said. Worth laughed a delighted overbubbling laugh, got up, and gave Hafidha a smacking kiss on the cheek.
“No PDA in the bullpen,” Reyes said from his office door.
Chaz was still processing. “You’re a lesbian?”
“Bisexual.” Worth’s grin widened and she leaned over Chaz, curling her fingers into claws. “No one is safe from my predatory ways!”
Chaz, after a moment’s puzzled and genuine alarm, shrank back in his chair, crying, “Aunty Em! Aunty Em!” in a remarkably good Judy Garland impression.
Hafidha said, “Your Aunty Em won’t save you now, boy. Ain’t you heard? We aren’t in Kansas anymore.”
Reyes made an I-give-up face and went back into his office, closing the door behind him.
And Brady, finally, began to laugh.

Standoff

FBI Headquarters, J. Edgar Hoover Building, Washington, D.C., March, 2004
Hafidha could feel Stephen Reyes too damned close behind her chair. She pretended she didn't and started writing another set of search filters.
“Can I see you in my office, please?” His voice was neutral, which, she already knew, meant absolutely nothing.
Hafidha turned in her chair and draped her arm over the back. “You can.”
It took him half a beat to figure it out, and his mouth lifted and compressed at one corner. Smart boy, Il Dottore. She almost wished she could have held off, just long enough to get more of a taste of this. No, better to do it now, before it hurt.
“Would you come with me to my office, please?”
“Sure thing.” She hit three keys to throw up the password-locked screensavers on her monitors and spun her chair. He'd already started out the door.
Hafidha followed Reyes through the bullpen. Peretti looked up at Reyes before his eyes shifted to her. He blinked, opened his mouth, seemed to reconsider, and turned back to the file in front of him.
Solomon Todd came out of the kitchenette and spotted her. His eyebrows lifted a little, just enough to line his forehead. He stuck out his lower lip in thought. Then he nodded to her and went on to his desk.
It was stupid. It wasn't as if it mattered. But that nod gave her a little warm, soft ball in her chest. It's been nice working with you, Agent Todd. A week I'll treasure always.
In his office, Reyes waved at the visitor's chair. She sat in it, and he closed the door. As she'd expected, he settled behind his desk, hands side by side and flat on the surface, before he spoke. “This building is full of people who voted for Ronald Reagan.”
Hafidha widened her eyes and made an O of her mouth. “Oh, no. Sir, just tell me what I can do to help.”
He looked down and pressed his lips together. Point to her. “Unfamiliar things make them nervous. Things that don't fit their world picture make them very nervous.”
He stopped and stared at her. So Hafidha stared back and nodded.
“Shadow Unit is so far out of their comfort zone that 'nervous' applies about as well as 'unfortunate' does to the Waco seige.”
She didn't laugh, but she knew he could see her throat compress around it. Point to him.
“I'm trying to keep us as much off the radar as I can, under the circumstances,” he continued. “The more successful I am at that, the better it is for the unit. We need a certain amount of hands-off attitude to get results.”
“Yes, sir,” Hafidha said, since it seemed like a good time to say something.
He clasped his hands. “You're making that harder.”
Battle is joined. She put a layer of sad-and-earnest on her face. “I know. I'm the wrong color. I'm a girl. But I thought, with all those federal anti-discrimination laws--”
“You know what I'm talking about.”
She smiled. She couldn't help it.
He added, “That is not how FBI agents dress.”
Hafidha did a quick inventory. Cowboy boots gleaming. Distressed-velvet skirt a little wrinkled, no helping that, but draping nicely. Vintage ladies' suit jacket, blue raw silk with covered buttons and asymmetrical lapels--best thing in her closet. No need to check her hair. It was cornrowed to top-of-ear height, then sprang free in natural curls to her shoulders. She'd done the purple streaks on Saturday. All her earrings matched.
Yep, perfectly groomed, professional, and a credit to herself. Last week she'd only been two out of three. She'd needed a week to know if this fight was worth having. “Face it, not many of them could dress like this.”
He raked his fingers through his own dense, barbered hair. “I'm asking for your help.”
Oh, hell. That took the fun right out of it. “I get that. Look, Secret Service? I was navy-blue suit and hair scraped back and nice black flat-heeled shoes every damned day. I did it because I loved the job, and that's what the job demanded. That I leave me at home.
“And look what that got me.”
The line of his jaw changed, hardened. Teeth clenched, probably. Join the club, Doctor Reyes.
“Now you want me here, working for you. And you promise that nobody will give me shit for what I am now. Well, this is what I am now. If you want the Real Me, you have to take the whole package.”
“Or?”
“Or I find someone in the private sector to love and cherish the multifaceted wonder that is me.” Maybe she could find a place in the private sector, maybe. One that wouldn't require a disguise harder to live behind than a navy-blue suit.
She saw something happen behind his eyes and added, “Or is this The Village, and I'm a number after all?”
“You mean, do I want you where I can keep an eye on you? Of course I do. But if I meant to lock you up, you would be already.”
“So. What do we do?”
Reyes stared at her, his mouth working a little. “I guess,” he said slowly, “I run interference for you, while you work miracles for me.”
It took a second for it to register. “No dress code?”
“I wouldn't go that far. And neither would you.”
She was weak with relief. My God, she'd wanted to stay. She hadn't known it until this moment. “Yes, sir. Very good, Capitaine.”
“I think I prefer 'sir'.”
“Of course you do.” She smiled, stood, and crossed the room to the door. The cowboy boots made an authoritative noise even on the carpet. She loved that. “Oh, and I should warn you. I'm getting a tattoo.”
Reyes laced his fingers together under his chin. “I already have one.”
Her smile stretched beyond her control. She bowed from the waist and let herself out into the bullpen and her future.

Dexterity | by Sarah Monette

Act I
Chicago, IL, January 2007
Hell came for Dyson Cieslewicz on a sunny Tuesday morning in mid-January.
Eddie shut the door of Dice’s room behind him and said, perfectly pleasantly, “I’m sorry, but this left-handed crap has got to stop.”
Dice was only half awake; he hadn’t gotten to bed until nearly four, still reeking of cigarette smoke and beer and other people’s sweat. “Eddie? Man, haven’t you heard of knocking?”
“I mean it, Dice.” Eddie was already standing beside the bed. He was built like a bulldozer, but he could move fast when he wanted. “This left-handed crap has got to stop.”
Dice sat up, left hand groping automatically for his glasses. “What the f—”
Eddie caught Dice’s left hand, pinning the wrist with his own left hand, his right hand folded around Dice’s fingers. “I’m sorry about this, I really am, but you just don’t fucking learn.”
And with a single sharp motion, Eddie Cieslewicz broke all four fingers on his older brother’s left hand.
Dice howled, folding into a semi-fetal ball, except for his left arm, which remained immobilized by Eddie’s iron grip. Eddie watched Dice’s agony for a moment, blank faced and unmoved, then said again, softly, “It has to stop,” and broke Dice’s thumb as well.

•

June 2007
On the morning of June twenty-eighth, Daniel Brady woke from the same old nightmare. “Motherfucker,” he said softly to the ceiling, then got out of bed and got moving.
The world was still tainted with blood and gunpowder when he got to work, and he was hoping—more desperately than he would ever have admitted—for a case, something, anything to force his mind away from the memory of that spreading pool of blood.
Coffee helped, transmuting the bitterness in his mouth, as did the spectacle of Chaz Villette all but unhinging his jaw to eat a raspberry danish.
“You look rough, Danny,” Todd said as he stirred creamer into his coffee. “Want me to beat Villette off long enough for you to grab a cruller?”
“Hey!” Chaz protested without a shadow of resentment or concern, and Brady felt the nightmare crack and fall away.
“That’s okay, but thanks. Wouldn’t want to deprive a growing boy of his sugar and carbs.”
“You may think you’re funny,” Chaz said, licking his fingers, “but you really really aren’t. Besides, sugar is a carbohydrate. And carbs are turned into glucose during digestion. So ’sugar and carbs’ is a tautology.”
“A which?”
Chaz smiled sweetly and insincerely. “You’re redundant, Brady.”
“I’d make a smart-ass reply, but there’d probably be something in it you’d need to correct,” Brady said. “So—how’d you do at the range Saturday?”
“Asshole,” Chaz explained, but he was grinning.
“If I may interrupt the kaffeeklatsch,” Reyes said dourly from the door, “I could use you all in the briefing room.”
Chaz jerked to his feet. Todd snorted. “I still think ’briefing room’ is an exaggeration.”
“Yeah,” Brady said, topping up his cup and turning to follow, “but ’briefing closet’ just doesn’t have the same ring.”
It was true, though, that the entire team couldn’t sit down in the briefing room at the same time, and only barely fit at all. Brady’s private suspicion was that this was some sort of complicated psychological stratagem on Reyes’s part, like using electric shocks to teach rats to run a maze, although what Reyes was trying to teach them he had no idea and was honestly afraid to speculate. Possibly to abandon the notion of personal space, he thought as he wedged himself between Chaz and Todd at the table.
Todd still smelled faintly of his Vespa and D.C. traffic. Next to him, Hafidha had her hair in cornrows as elaborate as crop circles and glittering silver polish on her fingernails. Reyes and Falkner were standing at the head of the table. Falkner never sat; Reyes sat or stood depending on his mood. Across from Brady, Worth, as bright-eyed and alert as ever, was watching Falkner watching Reyes, and Lau was immaculate but drinking coffee as if her life depended on it.
“Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,” Reyes said, still dour. “I appreciate these moments taken out of your very busy schedules.”
“God,” said Chaz, sotto voce. “Who peed in his coffee?”
Reyes didn’t hear him, but he must have sensed the disturbance in the Force—Brady and Todd carefully not laughing—for he glared around the room and said, “Chicago has a serial killer.”
“This is news?” muttered someone—Lau or Worth, both of whom were carefully blank faced by the time Reyes wheeled around to pin the glare on them.
“Chicago,” Reyes said, “has a serial killer who is beating his victims to death with, so far as Dr. Frost can tell me, his bare hands. And he’s doing it with a single blow.”
“That’s not necessarily a manifestation,” Chaz objected. “Certain areas of the body, particularly the neck and skull, are surprisingly fragile, and a well-placed blow can—”
Kill a man before he knows you’re there, Brady thought, but mercifully Reyes was already answering: “Bits of the third victim’s ribcage were embedded in the wall behind her.”
“Oh,” Chaz said, looking simultaneously embarrassed and nauseated.
“Chicago PD assumed he was using a sledgehammer until two days ago, when they got a witness who saw the host leaving the fourth victim’s apartment building. She saw him from behind and from three stories up, so there’s no hope of ID, but she was absolutely, unshakably certain that he wasn’t carrying anything. Word got to me, I had the fourth victim sent to Dr. Frost, and she says antemortem contusions of the apparent deathblow are consistent with the imprint of a set of knuckles. Left hand. His skull was crushed.”
“The host killed him with a bare-knuckle punch?” Brady said.
Todd whistled. “And he’s done it more than once?”
“Four times since February,” Reyes said. He knew the same thing they knew. As did Falkner, whose eyebrows were up. Chaz and Lau looked blank, although with Lau that meant her fingers were laced together in front of her rather than anything that was showing on her face. Worth was frowning at the autopsy report.
Brady said, “Punching somebody in the head is a damn fine way to break your hand.”
“Not for this guy, apparently,” said Todd.
“So Chicago’s ’Sledgehammer’ is one of ours,” Reyes said, investing the nickname with immeasurable distaste. “He’s already killed four, and thus far there’s been precious little luck in constructing a profile. That’s where we’re going to start. We need to make the victimology talk.”
That was Brady’s job, and he and Worth sat down with a sad stack of folders: Marcia Lopez, age 25, Kathleen Cherry, age 28, Lydia Harrigan, age 33, and Paul Brunowski, age 27.
“This is nuts,” Worth said after half an hour. “Three women and a man. Three whites and a Hispanic. Three people in their twenties and one in her thirties. Three of them had jobs, and Kathleen Cherry had a sugar daddy. Nothing across the board.”
“Not much of a sugar daddy,” Brady said. “They were living on his disability checks. So there’s one commonality: these are all working-class people. Also, they’re all practicing Catholics.”
“Not in the same parish,” Worth objected.
“No, but each victim’s effects included—”
“Brunowski had a St. Christopher’s medal,” Worth said, looking more interested.
“Right. Cherry and Lopez both wore crucifixes, and Lydia Harrigan’s rosary was found in her purse.”
“So you’re saying...”
“They were easily identifiable as Catholics to their murderer.”
“But he didn’t kill them for that. No graffiti, no desecration of the bodies.”
“No,” Brady agreed. “It’s not a hate crime. At least not in the traditional sense. He sure hated something about them, though.”
“No evidence of sexual assault.”
“But only one man. I think we can assume our guy’s straight, but whatever his trigger is, it overrode that.”
“You think he’s straight because he kills women?”
“I think he’s straight because he notices women. He was watching Harrigan, Cherry, and Lopez closely enough to see that they were Catholics, plus whatever else it was that set him off.” He shrugged. “It could just be the luck of the draw, but I don’t think it affects the profile either way. There’s no signs he’s enjoying himself. He doesn’t linger, either before or after.”
“Or during,” Worth said, wrinkling her nose.
“Or during. He comes with them to their homes—or that motel room in the case of Cherry—but he never gets farther than the first room. He doesn’t want to see their bedrooms.”
“Chicago forensics said he probably killed Kathleen Cherry standing in the doorway.” Worth shuffled papers, looking for the report. “There was no sign he even went into the room.”
“Getting it over with,” Brady murmured. “Going on about his business.”
“Doing the work of the Lord,” Worth said suddenly and shivered.
“Good one, Daph,” Brady said. “That’s why he’s going after Catholics. He’s Catholic himself.”
“So...what? They’re all wicked sinners?” Worth considered. “Well, I guess Cherry was living in sin—and cheating on her boyfriend to boot. And Brunowski was gay. But there was nothing wrong with Lopez or Harrigan.”
There was nothing wrong with Brunowski, Brady almost said, but that wasn’t what Worth had meant. Instead, he emended her statement: “Nothing that made it into the files. The map is not the territory.”
“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” Worth said, waving it off. “But he’s a house-cleaner, is my point.”
“He seems to be a mission-oriented serial killer,” Brady agreed more cautiously.
“Aw, c’mon, Danny. Give me one piece of this darn profile that works like it’s supposed to.”
“As long as you don’t get used to it,” Brady said.
They grumbled over the files until Reyes yelled that anyone not ready to go in five minutes was going to get left behind. Brady dumped everything into his briefcase while Worth darted for the bathroom. Chaz, who had been doing something arcane with a street map of Chicago, shoved it into his backpack with one hand, grabbing a handful of peanuts with the other, and muttered under his breath, “Yes, Dad, coming, Dad.”
“I heard that, Villette,” Reyes said, stone-faced as ever, and Brady thought, for what was probably the five hundredth time, that you would have to be seriously fucking nuts to play poker with Stephen Reyes.

•

On the plane, Stephen Reyes watched as Chaz Villette spread a street map of Chicago on the fold-out table, drawing the rest of the team from their seats on the jet like a piece of tinfoil attracting jackdaws.
“You want I should get you a dowsing rod?” Todd asked.
“You got one on you?” Chaz said, not looking up.
Todd made a show of checking his pockets, rummaging until Chaz was drawn into looking at him, then grinned, his face creasing like crumpled paper. “Must’ve left it in my other pants.”
Chaz tried to look irritated and failed. Brady said, “Geographic profile?”
It was obvious Chaz was pleased to be asked, pleased to be included in the team’s camaraderie instead of being the outcast at whose expense it was established. Reyes remembered how Chaz had been, fresh out of Quantico: long gangling limbs held close and tight, giving him a weirdly prim affect; his face wiped clean of all its natural expressiveness; his voice flat, soft, and every word precensored lest it sound too “brainy.” Only those eyes, dark and darker, watching everything and everyone, waiting for the next trap to trigger.
Reyes knew Chaz had been queer-bashed once, not because his fellow trainees thought he was gay, but because he was too different, and that was the only label they had to put on him. Chaz hadn’t reported it, because he’d also known it wasn’t about his sexual orientation.
Shadow Unit is better for him. It’s turned out all right, Reyes thought, and did not ask himself whom he was trying to convince.
“Well,” Chaz said, “it occurred to me that although none of the victims lived in the same neighborhood, they all lived relatively close to each other.” He jabbed at colored dots he’d made on the map, purple for Lopez, red for Cherry, blue for Brunowski, and green for Harrigan. “And the motel where Kathleen Cherry died isn’t far away either.” Another dot, this one orange. “So I thought, wherever he’s finding them, it’s probably somewhere in here.” He’d drawn circles around each dot, each with a carefully measured radius, and the area where most of them overlapped had been colored yellow.
All of which, Reyes knew, would be sharp and clear in Chaz’s mind. No map necessary. In fact, the map was probably only slowing him down; it would have taken him less time to work it out and simply tell them where to look. This performance—map, radii, colors—wasn’t for Chaz. He was doing it for them: showing them how his mind worked, demythologizing the monster. Making himself understood and therefore safe.
Chaz felt Reyes’s stare and looked up. Their eyes met; then Chaz gave him a Yeah, but you gotta grow where you’re planted shrug and looked back at the map of Chicago that was also, in this small, strange way, a map of Charles Villette.
“Y’know,” Lau said, “math classes might be a lot more popular if teachers told students they could catch serial killers with Venn diagrams.”
Brady said, “Would’ve worked for me.”
“Oh, hell yes,” said Worth. “So what’s in your yellow area?”
“I’ve got Hafidha working on that,” Chaz said. “She promised to have a list by the time we land.”
In fact, they got Hafidha’s list while they were still in the air. “Check your mail, G-men and women,” she said when Falkner switched her to speaker phone. “Relevant parts of the city directory are now yours.”
Chaz thumbed up the text message. “Thomas Jefferson Middle School.”
“None of the victims had kids,” Brady answered, as easily as a tennis pro returning a lob.
“Can we do anything with that?” Worth said.
“Three of the four were unmarried, and Lydia Harrigan had been separated from her husband for five years. No go.”
“Correlation is not causation, children,” Todd said, as Todd had a habit of saying.
“Then I guess we can cross the elementary school and the five daycares off the list, too,” Chaz said.
“Things I could’ve known yesterday,” Hafidha grumbled.
“Don’t quote Adam Sandler, Hafs,” Lau said. “It gives me hives.”
“Sorry, sweetie,” Hafidha said.
Reyes admired her for sounding so resolutely like herself, as if nothing had happened in Omaha. He admired the rest for sounding as if they weren’t walking on knives and eggshells in response.
“There are seven churches of various denominations, plus something that calls itself the Good News Kingdom Hall,” Hafidha continued, “but since all the victims are Catholic...”
Reyes lifted his head. “Are any of those churches a victim’s parish church?”
“Paul Brunowski went to St. Francis,” Hafidha said.
“Which is here,” Chaz said, drawing a blue star on his map.
“But Lopez attended Our Lady of the Holy Faith, which is twenty minutes away by bus. Services in Spanish. Kathleen Cherry was pretty lapsed, but when she attended anywhere, it was St. Agnes, which was also Lydia Harrigan’s church. It’s in Chaz’s DMZ, too.”
“Here,” said Chaz, drawing a green star.
How can you be “pretty lapsed”? Reyes thought, but did not say. Is it like being a “little pregnant”? He’d found that “lapsed” was a binary; once he cut his ties with the Catholic Church, he’d never had so much as a flicker of an impulse to return.
“That’s not terribly helpful.” Chaz looked discontentedly at his map. “Hafidha? What about public parks? Movie theaters? Um, supermarkets?”
“What about bars?” Brady said.
“Bars?” Chaz and Worth both looked puzzled.
“Bars,” Reyes agreed. “Working class victims, probably a working class host. The neighborhood bar is the place they’re most likely to have in common.”
“Working class people drink more?” said Lau, in the same tone she usually said “inscrutable Oriental.”
“Nope,” Brady replied. “Working class people are more likely to live in circumstances where it’s hard to socialize at home. So you go where everybody knows your name.”
Reyes nodded. He was surprised when Brady saw it and lifted his chin, leaned back in his seat. Daniel Brady shouldn’t need gold stars from him or anyone else. Of course he does. He’s human. So are the rest of them.
“There are two bars in the Yellow Zone,” Hafidha said. “The Crystal Cave and Stosh’s Bar.”
“All right,” Reyes said. “That gives us a division of labor when we hit the ground.”
“Running, of course,” Todd said.
“Of course,” Reyes said and didn’t let himself smile. Quite. “Villette, Brady, Lau, you take the Crystal Cave. Falkner, Worth, Todd, you take Stosh’s Bar. I’ll check in with the detective of record and see what we’ve got.”
Falkner gave him a look, the severely skeptical one he suspected she used on her daughters—though, one hoped, not on her husband. But if she knew, or guessed, that he was avoiding the memories that working class Chicago bars would dredge up, she was kind enough not to say anything about it.
Act II
Dice had kept his job at the Crystal Cave mostly because Greg the manager didn’t want to piss Eddie off. And because Dice had proved the hard way that, if he had to, he could cope with a beer keg. It hurt like a son of a bitch, but he wasn’t going to say that to either Greg or Eddie. Because things could be worse.
Things could be so much worse. A little tango or two with a beer keg wasn’t even worth the mention.
Dice was lucky, and he knew it. He fucking lived it, and he’d gotten the rabbit tattoo to be sure he remembered it. Left forearm, where he’d see it every time he forgot and reached for something with his left hand. His left hand that didn’t work all that well anymore.
Eddie’d gotten his friend Bruno who was a paramedic to splint it, and Bruno would probably lie down in front of a semi if Eddie asked him to and thought Dice was a pussy anyway, so he hadn’t asked questions even though he must have known it wasn’t an accident.
Dice had gotten one of those little stress balls and faked physical therapy as best he could, so at least his thumb still worked, although as far as gripping anything, the hand was pretty much a loss. But it was okay, because he wasn’t supposed to be using his left hand. You understand me, Dyson? Yes, Dad, I understand.
No, Eddie, I swear, I ain’t been using it. I can’t, see?
Dice shook himself. He’d learned since January not to let that train of thought get started. That was the other reason he’d gotten the rabbit tattoo, because the rabbit was secretly that rabbit from Watership Down, the one who couldn’t keep a secret and almost got everybody killed. A reminder, in other words, to keep his trap shut.
And not to use his left hand.
He’d gotten in the habit of tucking his left arm against his stomach, almost hiding his left hand under his right elbow. And wouldn’t you know it, the FBI guy, the one who was sitting out here keeping an eye on everybody while the other FBI guys—one of whom was actually an FBI lady—questioned them, one at a time, back in Greg’s office, this tall skinny FBI guy noticed and said, “Hurt your hand?”
Dice kept moving through the automatic flinch and freeze reaction, said, “Nah, old injury. You want more water?”
“Thanks,” the FBI guy said, and wow, he had a nice smile when he pulled it out. “We flew in from D.C. today and I feel like a desiccated frog. Do you—I mean, if it isn’t any trouble, do you have any lemon slices?”
“Sure.” He went and got a lemon out of the fridge in the back, said a quick Hail Mary, and cut it, holding it with the thumb and two fingers of his left hand that worked, using the knife with the right. The slices came out okay—a little uneven, but not so’s you’d notice—and he stuck all but one in the Rubbermaid container marked LEMON and went back out to give the FBI guy his water.
And the FBI guy, damn him, sat there and hoovered up the peanuts and noticed all the times when Dice would’ve used his left hand and couldn’t. “Must’ve been a pretty nasty injury,” he said. “How long ago did you say it was?”
“January,” Chrissy said, coming up on the FBI guy’s other side, and leaning on him so her cleavage would be the only thing he could see. “Dice broke his hand in January and he’s been a real bitch ever since.”
The FBI guy tried to lean away from Chrissy without it looking like that was what he was doing. “January, huh? That’s not that old.”
“Chrissy, for fuck’s sake, haul your tits in and let the man breathe.”
“Ooh, touchy,” Chrissy said and made a kissy-face at him before flouncing over to bother Kevin and the bouncer whose name Dice could never remember.
“Sorry,” Dice said to the FBI guy, who looked like he could use a hole to crawl into and die. “She wouldn’t come on that strong if she really thought you’d be interested.”
“I, um. I guess that’s reassuring.” He drank his water and ate more peanuts and didn’t say another word before the other FBI guy, the tank, came out and pointed at Dice. “You. You’re next.”

•

The bartender’s name was Dyson Cieslewicz, which gave both Brady and Lau, as veterans of America’s public school playgrounds, a momentary empathetic flinch. He was 5’10” and skinny, and he carried his shoulders in a defensive hunch that looked beyond habitual and well into constant. Acne scarred face, the Slavic cheekbones that went with the word apparatchik, and also lumpenproletariat, long dark hair, and glasses in those black frames that were either geeky or retro. Brady had lost track of which.
Brady had mostly been trained out of automatically associating “geek” with “loser,” but Dyson Cieslewicz was not a good advertisement for the side. He had two rings in his left eyebrow, ten—Brady counted—in his left ear, five in his right, including something Brady believed was called an “industrial.” There was an elaborate tattoo on his right arm, a dragon in blue and green and red winding around and around his forearm and glaring balefully out from his right biceps.
He sat down in the chair Brady indicated—cracked orange vinyl and cigarette burns—crossed his arms over his stomach, and peered at the two of them over the tops of his glasses.
Brady glanced at Lau and got the barest inclination of a nod in return before Lau went to work. More intimidation was not what this kid needed. “Mr. Cieslewicz,” Lau said, in her dealing-with-the-distraught-public voice, “we need you to look at these pictures and tell us if you recognize any of the subjects.”
Lau had the best dealing-with-the-distraught-public voice Brady had ever heard.
Cieslewicz scooted himself forward to the edge of the chair and looked at the pictures laid out on the desk. Brady watched him; unlike the manager and the first waitress they’d interviewed, Cieslewicz was actually looking, and after a frowning moment of contemplation, he said, “Yeah.”
“Which one?” Lau said, still in that lovely calm voice, even though she, like Brady, had to have the little voice in her head screaming Jackpot!
Cieslewicz looked up. “All of them.”
Brady and Lau did a momentary verbal Keystone Kops impression. Brady backed off; he’d given Lau lead, after all. Lau said, “You know all four of them?”
Cieslewicz shrugged, an ugly awkwardness. Brady thought, He hates his body. “Not know. But” —unclenching enough to jab a forefinger at the pictures as he spoke— “she drinks Molson, she drinks Stoli, she drinks Mai Tais, and Paul used to give me sh—give me a hard time, until Eddie threatened to rearrange his face.”
“Eddie?” Cieslewicz was femme in an Ugly Stepsister sort of way, but he wasn’t pinging Brady’s gaydar particularly.
A blush, painfully obvious as it made the pocked scars on his face stand out, and his right arm curled back around his body. “My brother. He’s a bouncer.”
“Is he here today?”
“’S’is day off. It’s the other guy today.”
“You recognized all four of them,” Lau said. “Did they know each other?”
Cieslewicz jerked his shoulders in a shrug. “How should I know? They don’t hang out together, but Paul mostly comes to play pool, and a lady who drinks Molsons and a lady who drinks Mai Tais are not ladies who have a lot in common, if you follow me. The Stoli lady, she comes in once a month, Fridays, like clockwork, has her shot of Stoli and then mostly she amscrays. I figure she comes straight from confession.”
“She’s Catholic?” Brady said, reminding himself not to quiver like a hunting dog on point.
Cieslewicz grinned, looking briefly as young as his driver’s license said he was. “I was an altar boy, believe it or not. I know the stigmata. The Stoli lady is definitely Catholic.”
“And the others?”
“Paul grew up going to St. Francis same as me, though I wouldn’t take bets on how long it’s been since his last confession. I got no idea about the other two. In this neighborhood, it’s even odds.”
“Are you a practicing Catholic, Mr. Cieslewicz?”
“I go to Mass. I light candles for my father. And what has that got to do with anything?”
“Nothing,” Lau said mildly, but that wasn’t a nothing and Brady didn’t need Lau’s sidelong flick of a glance to alert him. What she was setting up, though, remained unsprung. Chaz came in, crossed the office in three gangling steps and leaned over to murmur something in Lau’s ear. Lau’s poker face didn’t flicker; she said, “Mr. Cieslewicz, may we see your left hand?”
The bartender hunched in even further.
“Mr. Cieslewicz?”
“It’s nothing to do with you,” Cieslewicz muttered, his head lowering until nothing of him was visible except the fall of his hair.
“These four people have been murdered, Mr. Cieslewicz,” Chaz said.
It was brutally obvious that Dyson Cieslewicz hadn’t known. A motivated perp, anomalous or otherwise, could fake a lot of things, but nobody could have faked the way he went pale in blotches, the way he looked wildly back at the pictures, as if he could make them be of people he didn’t know, the way he released that tight protective curl of his right arm to cross himself.
Chaz was frowning, but he said, “Your hand?”
Cieslewicz extended it automatically. There was a tattoo of a rabbit on the inside of his wrist, delicate black lines and mad red eyes. The hand was obviously crippled, the joints swollen, skin mottled, ring and pinkie fingers jutting stiffly while index, middle, and thumb were curled protectively. Brady remembered the autopsy report and raised his eyebrows at Chaz. This guy?
“Mr. Cieslewicz,” said Chaz, raising his eyebrows at Brady over the bartender’s bowed head, “how did you hurt your hand?”
“Accident,” Cieslewicz mumbled. “In January, like Chrissy said.”
“Mr. Cieslewicz,” said Lau, “where were you on Tuesday night?”
“Tuesday? I was here, same as...” His head came up, and he stared from Lau to Brady, and then twisted to look up at Chaz. “You think I killed them? Because of...”
“Paul Brunowski’s skull was crushed by a left-handed blow,” Chaz said.
“You people are fucking nuts,” said Dyson Cieslewicz. “I can’t even make a fist no more, much less hit anybody with it.” He held his hand up, and they watched as his fingers tensed. The ring and pinkie fingers trembled, but did not bend.
“And how did you hurt your hand?” Chaz said, implacable as the hounds of Hell.
“Accident,” Cieslewicz said. “Like I told you.” He jerked his hand back into its sheltered position against his side.
Lau’s cellphone played “Ride of the Valkyries.” “Falkner,” she mouthed at Brady and whisked herself out the door.
“Let’s work on your alibi,” Brady said. “12:30 a.m. Wednesday morning.”
“Shift finished at midnight. I went home.”
“Is there anyone who can corroborate that?” Chaz asked.
“Do which?”
“Did anyone see you?” Brady translated.
“Eddie went out someplace. Prob’ly with Bruno.” That sounded like old bitterness. “Dunno if Mrs. Eckstein on the ground floor was awake. She might’ve been. But this is nuts. I didn’t kill anybody, and most especially not left-handed. You can see that.” He looked from Chaz to Brady, frustrated and frightened. “Can’t you?”
Brady raised an eyebrow at Chaz, who looked dissatisfied.
“What about May twelfth?” Brady said.
“Christ in a bucket!” Brady and Chaz just waited. “Okay, okay. May twelfth. What day was that?”
“Saturday,” Chaz said.
“Oh, then that’s easy. I was here. Six to two, only usually it’s more like three. And I got people to corroborate it.” He drawled corroborate out in angry mockery. “People out to here. You can start with Greg.” He glared at them defiantly.
Chaz muttered something like, “But there must be...”
Then Lau came in and said, “Sorry, boys, time to pack up the rodeo. Mr. Cieslewicz, thank you very much for your cooperation. Will you be here if we need to speak to you later?”
“’Til midnight,” Cieslewicz said. “And you got my address anyway.” He looked doubtfully at Chaz and Brady; Brady gave him the nod, and he left, moving like an alley cat that’s been in too many fights and been kicked too many times.
Brady stood up, cracked his spine, and followed Lau and Chaz out through the bar into the street, where Lau turned and said, “Chicago PD has another one. Fresh.”
Brady whistled soundlessly. “Fresh enough...?”
“Yeah. Nobody who’s here could have done it.”
“But if all four of them were regulars...” Chaz said, frowning.
Brady remembered something the bartender had said. “The brother!”
“What?” said Chaz.
“The bartender’s brother. It’s his day off.”
“Falkner wants us at the crime scene,” Lau said, starting briskly for the Suburban. “I’ll call Hafidha as we go. The brother’s name is Eddie, right?”
“Yeah. Probably Edward, but it could be Edmund.”
“Or Edwin,” Chaz said. “Or Edsel. Or Edison.”
“Chaz,” said Lau. “Stop helping. Hafs? We need everything you know on an Edward—or Edmund—”
“Or Edmonton,” Chaz said.
“Cieslewicz,” Lau said and stuck her tongue out at Chaz. “C-I-E-S-L-E-W-I-C-Z.”
Brady fished out the keys and hit the button to unlock the doors about two seconds before Chaz, who covered ground like one of those huge walking tanks in Star Wars, reached for the handle.
“What do we know about Number Five?” Brady asked. “Did Falkner give you anything?”
“Just the address and the name: Stephanie Fisher. She was a single mother.”
“Shit,” Brady said. “Was the kid—”
“There?” Lau said unhappily. “That’s how they found her so fast: he was crying.”
“Shit,” Brady said.
“I’ve notified Child and Family Services.”
Chaz grimaced, and although he was in the front seat and Lau in the back, she said, “It’s the best we can do.”
“I know,” Chaz said, hunching into himself like a turtle—or, Brady thought and told his profiler’s brain to shut up—like Dyson Cieslewicz being asked about his crippled hand.

•

Stephanie Fisher’s sprawled puppet-broken body was being examined by a forensics technician when they got to her apartment. As with the other victims, she was lying near her front door. The nearby stroller was skewed at an angle that made Brady’s fingers itch to straighten it.
Falkner was holding the baby, looking simultaneously incongruous and perfectly natural, and she said as they came in, “There’s a case worker on her way. Thank you, Lau.”
The baby was wide-eyed and silent, his skin shadow-dark against Falkner’s white shirt. He looked healthy, clean, well cared for, although he’d been crying hard and would probably be crying again soon. Brady didn’t blame him.
“Where’s Reyes?”
“Still playing éminence grise with the Chicago PD. He seems to think Detective Bruckner needs leaning on.”
The apartment was clean, very neat, decorated with more care than money, and with a lot of color, colors picked up by the beads in Stephanie Fisher’s dreads. There was a guitar hanging on the wall, well out of the reach of a baby’s inquisitive fingers. Chaz walked over to inspect it, probably more to get away from the body and the wide-eyed baby than anything else. Then he stiffened.
“What?” said Brady.
“It’s a left-handed guitar,” Chaz said. “Is she left-handed?”
“She’s got a writing callus that says so,” the forensics tech said.
“Chaz, it’s the murderer who’s—”
“No, no, no, no, no,” Chaz said. “What about the other victims? Do we know? Can we find out?”
“Is there anyone in the WTF who doesn’t have Hafidha on speed dial?” Lau said, her phone already against her ear. “Hafs? The victims—lefties or righties?” She listened a moment, her eyebrows climbing. “Southpaws, all of them. Thanks.”
“Chaz?” said Falkner. “You want to explain?”
“Dyson Cieslewicz’s broken hand,” Chaz said. “All four fingers and the thumb. I can’t think of a way that could happen by accident. And I was watching him, before. He’s a left-handed man forcing himself to use his right hand. I thought he was the host, that the anomaly was letting him use that hand to kill, even though it’s crippled, but I had it backwards.”
“But it still doesn’t—”
Chaz interrupted Falkner without even noticing. “Dyson Cieslewicz isn’t the host. He’s the first victim.”
“We were wondering about his brother anyway,” Brady said.
“Yeah, but that was just an opportunity for today,” said Chaz. “This is the rest of it. This is why. Dyson Cieslewicz’s broken hand is where it starts.”
“You think Eddie did it,” Lau said. “Because his brother’s left-handed?”
“I think we need to talk to Dyson Cieslewicz again,” said Brady.
“Lau, take the baby,” Falkner said. “I’m coming, too.”
Act III
Dice had barely gotten himself talked down, had just taken over from Greg at the bar—already bracing himself for the questions about why they’d been closed for an hour and a half in the middle of the day—when the FBI was back.
This time they had their boss with them, and you didn’t have to ask to know that lady was their boss. She looked around the bar like a searchlight in one of those old World War II escape-from-the-Nazis movies, and then the tank and the gawky guy who’d said he felt like a frog were headed straight for the bar.
All Dice’s instincts said to run like fuck, but—unlike most of Eddie’s loser friends—Dice was smarter than his instincts. He stood pat, and when the tank said, “We need to talk to you again,” he just nodded and let them take him back to Greg’s office.
“Have a seat, Mr. Cieslewicz,” the tank said.
“No thanks,” Dice said, “unless you guys are gonna sit down, too.”
“Ooh, score one for the opposing team,” said the frog and smiled at him, a quick little there-and-gone grin that made Dice feel better despite himself.
“Chaz.” The boss, exasperated. She sat down in Greg’s chair, pointed the tank and the frog—Chaz—at the love seat along the wall, then gave Dice a smile that was all steel and not really very much smile. “Have a seat, Mr. Cieslewicz.”
He sat.
Chaz the frog, leaning forward, said, “Mr. Cieslewicz, did your brother do that to your hand?”
The world went very bright and very sharp, and Dice was halfway to the door before he even knew he was moving. So much for being smarter than his instincts. And then he wasn’t going anywhere, because the tank had a very polite, very unshakable grip on his shoulder, which if he shifted about a tenth of an inch was going to be red-hot agony. Dice knew that grip from his dad. He held still.
“Mr. Cieslewicz, I really am sorry about this,” Chaz said, and damn him, he sounded like he meant it. Dice turned his head very cautiously to look at the love seat, and the tank let him do it. Chaz was still leaning forward, watching him with wide eyes, and he did mean it. “But we have to know. The five people who have been murdered—”
“Five?” Dice said and then braced himself, but the tank’s grip stayed polite.
“Five. A fifth this afternoon,” the boss said. “Stephanie Fisher.”
“Stephanie? Oh fuck. Fucking hell. You can let go of me, tank. I ain’t going anywhere.”
The tank let go like he thought he was going to have to grab on again in a moment, but Dice just went back to the chair and sat down. “She played here. Open mic on Thursdays. She wasn’t very good yet, but she was gonna be, y’know? Oh fucking hell. What about Noah? Is he okay?”
“Is Noah her baby?” the boss said.
“Yeah. His father’s in Joliet on account of some stupid shit he should’ve known better than, so it’s just—it was just Stephanie and Noah, and she was running herself into the ground... Jesus.” He took his glasses off, pinched the bridge of his nose. “Is Noah okay?”
“He’s fine,” the boss said. “Child and Family Services will take care of him. Unless you know of someone—a grandmother, an aunt?”
Dice shook his head. “I don’t know. Stephanie wasn’t from Chicago, and she never...I don’t know.”
“It’s all right,” the boss said. “It’s their job, not yours. Your job right now is to tell us about your brother.”
“You think Eddie did this.” It wasn’t a question, and he couldn’t get his voice any louder than a whisper.
“Did Eddie hurt you?” Chaz asked softly.
And oh God now that somebody finally asked, that question was so easy to answer, it was like falling down a well. “Yes,” Dice said.
“Your hand.”
“Yes.”
“Why?”
“Left hand’s the Devil’s hand.” His voice sounded too far away, too spooky. “Dad taught us that.”
He’d called his mother, the day after Eddie broke his hand, although he still wasn’t quite sure why. He wasn’t a kid anymore; he didn’t think his mother could make everything all right.
She told him about Dad’s bowling league, and the coaching he was doing at the Boys’ Club, and Dice shut his eyes and remembered her voice twenty years ago: You’re Dyson Cieslewicz now, and this is your Dad. He adopted you and Eddie, Dyson, legally and everything, isn’t that wonderful? He remembered her fingers pinching his shoulder, telling him it was wonderful and he’d better agree. So he’d nodded, but that hadn’t been enough. Say thank you to your new dad, Dyson.
Thank you.
Thank you, what? his mother prompted, her smile getting brighter, more fixed, and Dice had looked at his shoes—bulky, shiny black shoes that pinched his toes, shoes he only had to wear on Sunday, except he’d had to wear them today, and today was Tuesday—and whispered, Thank you, Dad.
He’d sat up that night, after Eddie was asleep and snuffling into the pillow, sat up and watched out the window for his father to come, to stand on the sidewalk and wave up at him and make this all not be real.
But Bobby Spivak didn’t come. Bobby Spivak wasn’t coming, wasn’t coming back from wherever it was and whoever it was he’d run off to find, and it was the next morning that Dice had been buttering toast and Art Cieslewicz had turned him around, pinned him against the counter, and slapped him so hard he bit the inside of his cheek and tasted blood all morning. No son of mine is going to be a sissy freak like that. You don’t want to be like your father, do you, Dyson? DO YOU?
And his mother, sitting at the table with Eddie, hadn’t said a word.
Later, after the third time, the fourth time, she’d told him what lies to give his teachers. Your dad’s a good man, Dyson. He didn’t have to adopt you, but he did. I’ve been unhappy a lot in my life, and it’s not easy for a man to take on a woman with two children. You don’t want to ruin this for me, do you?
No, he didn’t. He only wanted to be good, but he’d never been able to be good enough.
“Is Eddie left-handed?” asked the tank.
“Nah. Eddie learned. Not like me.”
“Eddie learned not to be left-handed?”
“Dad made him. Said we didn’t want to be like our father.” Christ in a bucket, Cieslewicz, these people are not here to play Twenty Questions. “Our father—whatsit, biological father—he ran off when I was five and Eddie was two. Mom remarried, and he adopted us. So he’s Dad. And he had this thing about being left-handed. He couldn’t stand it, said it was the mark of Satan and everything. So he made us switch. Only I was never any good at it, and he beat the everloving shit out of me every couple months. Almost killed me when I was fifteen.”
“And Eddie?”
“Eddie got the hang of the right-handed thing. Not a lefty at all. Except...”
It’d been easier for Eddie for some reason—because he was younger, because he was better coordinated, Dice didn’t know. But Eddie went from using his left hand to using his right hand with nothing more than a spanking or two, and Dice was glad because he didn’t want Eddie to hurt like he did half the time.
But Dad started saying there must be something really wrong with Dice, really wicked, if Eddie could learn to be right-handed and Dice couldn’t. The left hand is the Devil’s hand, Dad said, and the worst thing was when Eddie started saying it, too.
Eddie was too young to remember their father; Eddie was exactly the kind of son Dad wanted, the kind of son he could teach to box and take to the gym on weekends and brag about to his bowling league. Eddie practically worshipped Dad. Eddie wanted to be just like Dad. And now Eddie had—
The boss brought him back to now with, “Mr Cieslewicz? You said ’except’?”
“Oh, sorry. Right. Yeah. Except in the ring.”
She leaned forward. “The ring?”
“Boxing.”
“Eddie’s a boxer,” the tank said, like something was making sense to him now.
“Well, he was. He quit right after Christmas.”
“About the same time he broke your hand?”
“Um. Yeah. About.”
“Did you notice any other changes at that same time?” the boss asked. “Increased appetite? Mood swings?”
“Well, our grocery bills about tripled, if that’s what you mean.”
“You live with him?” said the tank.
“Yeah,” Dice said, blushing now because he’d admitted Eddie hurt him, and the next obvious question was why he hadn’t moved out, why he’d just hung around like a battered wife or something. He didn’t have an answer to that, except that Eddie was his brother and until January he’d never...not even when they were kids...he’d parroted everything Dad said about being left-handed and being a freak and a sissy and wicked and wrong, but he’d never once told. Never once.
They didn’t ask that question, though. They wanted to know about Eddie’s schedule, where he was on particular days at particular times. And every time Dice had to say he didn’t know, that it was Eddie’s day off, or Eddie’d traded a shift with the other bouncer, or Dice had learned not to ask what Eddie did on the nights he didn’t come straight home after work, their faces got grimmer and more certain.
“Would he ever have seen Stephanie Fisher play?” Chaz asked finally.
Dice’s stomach was gone, there was just this cold hollow nothing. “Last week,” he said. “The other guy wanted Thursday off. And Stephanie was good that night. I remember saying something to Eddie on the way home, and he just kind of grunted at me. But Eddie doesn’t care about music much.”
“And did he know we were here today?” the tank said.
“Yeah, I called, because, I mean, how often do you get the...oh god it’s my fault. He went after Stephanie today because I...that’s it, isn’t it? It’s my fault.”
“No,” Chaz said. “He’s accelerating anyway, and it’s his day off. He was probably planning—”
“If I’d had the guts to go to the police back in January, he wouldn’t have got the chance to kill anybody at all. They would’ve locked him up or made him do therapy or something, wouldn’t they?”
“We can’t know,” the boss said.
“And you didn’t know,” Chaz said, all wide-eyed again. “Did you?”
“No! I thought it was just me and Dad and the whole fucked-up thing. I thought it was us.” Which, Jesus, sounded sick, but he didn’t know how else to put it.
“Don’t blame yourself for doing the best you could,” Chaz said.
And the tank said, “One last question, Mr. Cieslewicz. Do you know where Eddie is now?”
Act IV
Reyes met his team in front of the Crystal Cave. Two SUVs full of FBI agents and Chaz Villette standing on the sidewalk, arguing with a skinny, ugly man who carried himself like an abuse victim. Reyes got out of Detective Bruckner’s unmarked car and immediately started listening for clues.
“...look, I’m just saying that maybe if you let me talk to him, you wouldn’t need a fucking SWAT team!”
“Mr. Cieslewicz,” said Chaz, who was clearly trying to edit his response on the fly. More fieldwork, and he’d get the hang of it. “Your brother is one of a very rare kind of serial killer—I’m sorry,” he added as Cieslewicz flinched, “I’m really sorry, but it’s what he is, and...” Reyes watched him bite back the word host, bite back the word UNSUB, and finally settle lamely on, “people like him tend to be very resistant to capture.”
“That’s what I’m saying!” Cieslewicz said, almost bouncing with frustration. “Let me talk to him and maybe he won’t be so resistant he has to end up dead!”
Chaz floundered, and Reyes said, “Let him come.”
“Sir?” This time, what Chaz bit back looked a lot more like Are you out of your mind?
Reyes pulled him aside, out of earshot of Cieslewicz, though not quite out of earshot of the avidly listening Detective Bruckner. “It may be possible to bring Edward Cieslewicz in without bloodshed,” Reyes said, unperturbed, knowing that Chaz would hear the subtext Bruckner wouldn’t: It may be possible to bring Edward Cieslewicz in alive. “But it becomes a lot more possible if we have someone he can connect with.”
“That’s what hostage negotiators are trained for,” Chaz said, giving him a skeptical look worthy of Falkner.
“No hostages,” Reyes countered.
“That’s what I’m trying to—” Chaz broke off, and the nature of the skepticism in his expression changed. “You think you’ve seen something.”
“I think there’s a reason Cieslewicz’s first victim is still alive. And I think if we can use that to our advantage, we should do so. Chaz.” That brought Chaz’s gaze to his face, waiting. “I won’t let him get hurt.”
“All right,” Chaz said and loped back over to Dyson Cieslewicz—who registered surprise, then nodded and followed Chaz back to where Reyes and Bruckner were waiting. Chaz performed introductions, and Reyes gave him a pleased nod for remembering. Dyson Cieslewicz shook hands and squinted at Reyes against the sun. “You really think I can help?”
The uncertainty was at odds with his earlier insistence; behind the barricading glasses, his eyes were gray and defenseless and asked his real question: Do you really think you can save my brother? Reyes gave him a reassuring smile and said, “Yes, I do.”

•

The Cieslewicz brothers lived on the fourth floor of an ugly gray box of an apartment building three blocks from the Crystal Cave. Reyes and Brady went up first, but there was no one in the apartment, and Brady radioed Falkner to let Cieslewicz in.
Reyes was bagging the blood-stained Gold’s Gym t-shirt lying in the middle of the floor when Cieslewicz stepped into the apartment. He went a little green at the sight.
Reyes watched to be sure that was all. No, Cieslewicz wasn’t going to contaminate the scene. “Mr. Cieslewicz, was your brother wearing this today?”
Cieslewicz swallowed and nodded.
“Look around,” Brady said. “Anything else look out of place?”
“We don’t usually keep the Bible on the kitchen table,” Cieslewicz said.
“It’s open to Matthew,” said Reyes. “And he’s left his wallet and keys on the table.”
Cieslewicz squinted near-sightedly at the keys. “Everything’s there but the apartment key. So he’s either smoking in the courtyard” —Brady looked out the window and shook his head no— “or he’s in the basement.”
“What’s down there?” Reyes asked, while Brady talked to Falkner about covering exits from the building.
Cieslewicz shrugged, a tight motion almost like a shudder. “The laundry machines. Some storage lockers. Mr. Demarco’s woodworking equipment.”
“Anything he could use as a weapon?” Brady said. “As for example a gun?”
“I don’t think so. Eddie’s more likely to use his fists anyway.” Then he blanched. Reyes had often wondered what it was like to learn that your loved one was a murderer several times over; he thought now, as he’d thought before, It’s like reaching out with a phantom limb.
And then Cieslewicz’s eyes widened. “Matthew Eighteen. Oh fucking hell.” And before either Reyes or Brady could react, he turned and bolted, greyhound fast, and all they could do was run after him. Down the stairs, then down a dark, narrow hallway with the faint lingering smell of wet garbage. They caught him at the door to the basement. It was open, and the lights were on.
Brady got a grip on Cieslewicz’s shoulder and said in a hard whisper, “You wanna explain what that was?”
“Matthew Eighteen-Eight. If your hand or foot causes you to sin...” He looked from Brady to Reyes, and Reyes saw knowledge in his eyes like death.
Understanding hit Brady an instant later, and Cieslewicz made a tiny noise of pain as his grip tightened for a split-second.
“Are you sure?” Reyes said, catching Cieslewicz’s gaze and holding it.
“Yeah,” Cieslewicz said. “I’m sure.”
“All right.” Either Eddie Cieslewicz had already cut his hand off and bled to death, in which case there was nothing dangerous left in the basement, or he was still trying to make up his mind. In which case, the sudden entrance of the FBI would almost certainly panic him into action, but his brother...
This was why he’d let Dyson Cieslewicz come along.
“You go down first,” Reyes said in Cieslewicz’s ear. “Try to get him to talk to you. Keep him as calm as you can.”
Brady swelled like a bullfrog with objections, but Reyes caught his eye and stared him down.
As he’d expected, Cieslewicz did not protest that he couldn’t keep Eddie calm; he probably prided himself on his ability to “handle” his brother. Reyes would have bet money that the pattern of abuse between them was of far longer duration than the presence of the anomaly.
Cieslewicz nodded jerkily and started down the stairs, calling, “Eddie? You down here?”
Brady and Reyes clearly heard the answering voice: “Dice?”
The clunk of Cieslewicz’s boots on the stairs stopped. “Eddie? Where are you, man?”
“Don’t come any closer, Dice.” Eddie Cieslewicz didn’t sound good.
“Eddie? You okay?”
“I thought I was doing the right thing. I thought if they wouldn’t learn, they had to be... I couldn’t teach everyone the way I taught you. And it made sense. I knew that hand was bad, but when I realized how strong it was, like the hand of Samson, I thought I was getting a chance to, I dunno, redeem it. To do God’s work, even with an unworthy tool. And you learned, didn’t you, Dice? I did the right thing with you, didn’t I?”
“Like hell,” Brady muttered, only just loud enough for Reyes to hear.
“Eddie.” The sound of Dice Cieslewicz descending another two, three steps. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“Don’t come any closer! And maybe I had it wrong. ’Cause I didn’t use my left hand on you. I was careful. But I thought...” Eddie Cieslewicz’s voice trailed off into indistinct muttering.
“What did you think?” Dice’s footsteps changed as he reached the bottom of the stairs and moved from wood to concrete.
“I thought I could make things better. I thought I could make the world cleaner. But...the baby was crying, Dice. I could hear him all the way down the hall. And she couldn’t. She couldn’t hear her baby because I...
“Because you beat her to death,” Dice said, not ungently. “Just like Dad almost did to me.”
“Fuck!” Brady said, but Reyes held up his hand to keep him still.
“That wasn’t right, was it?” Eddie said, and Reyes remembered that Dice was the elder of the brothers.
“No, Eddie, that wasn’t right.” Doc Martens scuffing over a concrete floor. “But it’s good that you know that. It means you don’t have to... Jesus fucking Christ, Eddie, would you get away from that thing?”
“I’ve been thinking about it,” Eddie said. “And about what it says in Matthew. I looked it up when I got home.” And he recited it, just as Dice had started to: “If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into eternal fire.”
The whine of a table saw underlay the threat of everlasting fire, and now Reyes and Brady were both scrambling madly for the basement stairs. “Eddie,” said Dice, his voice as shaky and strained as his brother’s, “that’s not necessary, man. I get that you’re sorry—”
“FEDERAL AGENTS! FREEZE!” Brady roared, reverting to type, although Reyes would have freely admitted he didn’t have a more subtle plan.
Edward Cieslewicz looked like someone had taken Dyson and fiddled with his aspect ratio: the same height, but twice as broad. And there was nothing gentle in Eddie’s face.
Reyes was pleased to see that Dice had stayed out of his brother’s reach, well away from the table saw’s whirling scream. Brady moved instantly to interpose himself between Eddie and Dice; Reyes moved the other way, and Eddie’s eyes tracked him.
“You are too fucking late, man,” he said and brought his left wrist down squarely and hard onto the table saw’s blade.
It was Dice who screamed. Eddie didn’t make a sound.
Blood flew in a tremendous spattering arc, painting all of them with Eddie’s sin. Reyes and Brady lunged for Eddie, but he used the anomaly’s unnatural strength against himself, pushing against the saw blade, and when Brady tackled him away from the saw, Eddie’s hand remained behind.
Dyson Cieslewicz, screaming obscenities, dragged his t-shirt off and shouldered Brady aside. He began applying pressure to the stump of his brother’s left wrist.
Brady told the radio to call for a fucking ambulance and hurry!
Entirely automatically, Reyes turned the saw off. And flinched from the still warm touch of Eddie Cieslewicz’s left hand.
Act V
The hospital was nice and gave Dice something clean to wear, his own clothes being pretty much soaked in Eddie’s blood and confiscated by the FBI to boot. Which was fine, when he thought about it. Because how often were you going to wake up and think, Yeah, today I want to wear the shirt I used to keep my brother from bleeding to death after he cut off his own hand on purpose?
Not very fucking often, was Dice’s feeling.
So he felt kind of ridiculous, in those blue hospital-type pajamas and his ratty sneakers and his leather jacket that some FBI guy had been nice enough to bring along, but at least he didn’t look like prom night in Carrie and he didn’t have to deal with the smell anymore. And they’d stuck him in a little waiting room, not out there in the freakshow of the ER waiting room, for which he was profoundly grateful, thank you, hospital.
He sat on one of the little flowery couches and tried to pretend he was reading a magazine, although he wasn’t even seeing the pictures, never mind the words. And his hands were shaking, but he was ignoring them. Every once in a while, he’d have to squeeze his eyes shut and wait out a huge cramping shudder, but then he’d look back at the magazine and maybe even remember to turn the page.
And then his parents came in.
Mom was crying and Dad looked sort of pissed off and sort of confused, which was a very bad look and everything in Dice staggered into Red Alert for, God, the fourth or fifth time that day and wasn’t Thursday ever going to end?
“Dyson!” Mom said, or kind of wailed. “What happened?”
Dice stood up, purely on instincts that said don’t let him stand over you and don’t let him get between you and the door and don’t let him trap you, and his mouth opened and said, “Well, Mom, Eddie went batshit crazy.”
Mom covered her face and sobbed. Dad’s head snapped around, and he said, “Don’t speak to your mother like that.”
Which, okay, Dice hadn’t meant to. The words had just come out, and he would’ve taken them back if he could.
But.
He knew exactly why he was scared of his stepfather, down to the tally of broken bones (seven—two up on Eddie: three ribs, his left forearm, his nose, his left cheekbone, and oh yeah, his skull). But standing there in his leather jacket and blue hospital pajamas, like a refugee from a movie about Hell’s Angel nurses, with the memory of Eddie’s blood still under his fingernails, he looked at Art Cieslewicz and thought, Why did I ever care about you? He said, “Sorry. I guess watching Eddie cut his own freaking hand off has got me kind of rattled.”
Mom sobbed louder, and Dad was torn between comforting her and tearing strips off Dice. Which was, all in all, a really great moment for the tank to stick his head in and say, “Mr. Cieslewicz, could we speak to you for a moment?”
“Sure,” Dice said.
“Who the hell is that?” Dad demanded.
The guy who arrested Eddie, Dice almost said, but the tank got there first.
“Daniel Brady, FBI,” he said and shook hands. He didn’t yield a millimeter to Dad’s grip, just grinned toothily and gripped back, hard enough that Dad almost winced. “You must be Arthur Cieslewicz. The local field office will have an agent here to speak to you in, oh, about two minutes. I just need a minute of your stepson’s time.” He raised his eyebrows at Dice. “Coming?”
“You bet,” Dice said and, looking down at his magazine as he abandoned it, discovered he’d spent the last hour staring at a copy of Modern Maternity.
Chaz was waiting in the hall, and he gave Dice this weird grimace that Dice decided was probably supposed to be a supportive sort of smile. “We’re heading back to D.C., but we just wanted to tell you a little about what’s going to happen next.”
“That ain’t your job, is it?”
“Um,” said Chaz, and “Not exactly,” said Brady.
They looked at each other, and Brady went on, “Cases like your brother’s are a little unusual, and there are things that—”
Chaz leapt in: “If we don’t tell you, nobody will.”
“He’s going to go to a secure facility in Ashton, Virginia,” Brady said. “It’s called Idlewood. He’ll be confined, but the doctors will do their best to be sure he’s comfortable.”
“There are drugs that help,” Chaz said. “Sometimes.”
“He’ll have access to books and DVDs and music. After he’s settled, you’ll be able to write letters to him, although all his correspondence will be monitored.”
“You can visit, if you want,” Chaz said.
“This Idlewood place get many visitors?” Dice said.
“No. But it’s an option,” Chaz said earnestly. “We didn’t want you not to know you had the option.”
“Thanks.”
“What he is, it isn’t his fault,” Chaz said. “It’s...it’s like an illness.”
“That’s what they always say about crazy people.”
“No. I mean, yes, but no, that wasn’t quite what I meant. What happened to Eddie...” He looked helplessly at Brady.
Brady sighed. “This is where we say we can’t talk about our job. But it’s true, what Chaz says. Something happened to Eddie. It’s no more his fault than it would be if he’d been hit by a car.”
“You aren’t talking about the batshit crazy part.”
“No,” said Brady at the same time Chaz said, “Yes.” They glowered at each other.
Their bosslady came out of the stairwell and said, “Do you want on this plane, or would you rather walk home?”
Dice shook hands with Brady—who made no effort at all to crush his knuckles—and then with Chaz. Chaz’s handshake was awkward, kind of like shaking hands with a folding chair, but for sure the opposite of a dead fish, and he said, “It’s complicated. But I’ve never seen anybody fight the...well, the infection the way Eddie did. And you care about him, right?”
“Yeah.” Because he did. Because Eddie was his brother and had never told on him and hadn’t killed him, either, although Dice could do the math on all the other dead left-handed people and knew he should have been one of them. “Ashton, you said?”
Chaz smiled at him—and wow, he had a really nice smile when he pulled it out—and said, “Yeah. Ashton, Virginia.” He slung his bag over his shoulder, gave Dice an awkward little wave, and followed Brady toward the stairs.
Dice watched him go, hearing his parents’ voices rising in a fight behind him, and wondered if they’d let him in to see Eddie before they took him away. He wanted to let Eddie know he wasn’t giving up.

•

Reyes glowered around the briefing room. “How many of you are left-handed?”
Brady closed his fingers around his coffee mug and looked down the table.
Hafidha raised her hand.
Chaz, at Brady’s left shoulder, said, “Um.”
“Yes, Dr. Villette?” Reyes said.
Chaz raised both hands. “I confess! Ambidextrous! Maybe a little left-dominant.”
“You write with your right hand,” Worth objected.
Chaz shrugged one of his complicated shrugs, the kind that made him look like he had too many joints. “Actually, I write with both. But trying to find a left-handed desk is a pain.”
“Left-handed by birth, right-handed by the grace of the Las Vegas Public School System,” Todd suggested.
“Something like that. But it’s not a trauma or anything. Besides, I like fountain pens.”
“You can really write with either hand?” Worth said. “How ’bout a demonstration?”
“Okay. Um.” He leaned over and snagged the ballpoint out of Brady’s fingers.
“Hey!” Brady protested, pro forma.
“Just wait. Uncle Chaz is going to do a magic trick.” He thought a moment and wrote, right handed, when you stare persistently into an abyss, the abyss also stares into you. Then he flipped the pen neatly into his left hand and wrote the same phrase. The writing was a little different, a little back-slanted, but clear and precise and still quite obviously Charles Villette’s handwriting.
“Wow,” Worth said, mock-solemn.
“No, no,” Chaz said. “That’s not the magic trick. This is.” And still left-handed, he wrote, swiftly and fluidly, the same phrase for the third time, indistinguishable from how he’d written it right-handed, except flawlessly reversed.
“Mirror writing,” Reyes said, with that look in his eye, the one Brady hated, the one that said what Stephen Reyes really wanted most in this world was a chance to open up Chaz Villette’s skull and go poking around inside.
“Yeah,” Chaz said, a little uncomfortably. “The funny thing is, when I learned how to write initially, I didn’t do that. But when I figured out that my teachers would get on my case less if I was right-handed, and I switched, my left hand started doing that.” He jabbed the pen at the line of mirror writing. “So basically I learned to write three times, once with my right hand and twice with my left, and whoa, off-topic, sorry about that.” He looked back at Reyes. “Was there a reason you wanted to know?”
“Seventy-two percent of anomalous individuals for whom we have these data are left handed,” Reyes said.
Falkner gave him an exasperated look. “So are you.”
“But that is significant, statistically speaking,” Chaz said, although he didn’t sound happy about it, “given that the occurrence of left-side dominance in the population as a whole is only fifteen to twenty-five percent. Higher for people of Asian descent.”
“Right-handed, thank you,” Lau said.
Todd tipped his chair back and said loudly to the ceiling, “Correlation is not causation.”
“But it’s a very suggestive correlation,” Reyes said.
Chaz said, almost too softly to be heard, “The left hand is the Devil’s hand,” and gave Brady back his pen.

Four Horsemen

FBI Headquarters, J. Edgar Hoover Building, Washington, D.C. February, 2002
Reyes leaned against the doorframe, fiddling with the string of his tea bag. “You’re a natural for this one.”
Todd observed that why, yes, he could still be surprised. “No, no. I’m unnatural for everything. It’s my defining character note.”
People Reyes smiled at had to be good at sorting out which smile-shaped expression they were getting. This was the slow, almost-comfortable one. Could be good, could be a rain of frogs. Todd reserved judgment.
“Exactly.” Reyes squeezed the tea bag between thumb and two fingers and flicked it into the trash. “Come see me when you get a break. I’ll fill you in.”
“Are there four horsemen involved?”
Reyes pushed away from the doorframe. His smile widened alarmingly. “Not yet.”
Todd watched him down the hall and around the corner out of sight. “Mama told me not to come,” he sighed.

Oranges

Somewhere over Kansas, April, 2007
On an airplane somewhere over Kansas, it occurred to Daphne that she had never seen anyone eat oranges as Esther Falkner did. It seemed to require such concentration, the sleeves of her gray-and-violet striped suitcoat pushed up her etched forearms as she first slit the rind with a thumbnail. Peeling it back in ragged petals released the rich scent of citrus oil, made bitterer when she meticulously scraped the pith off the membrane. Most people would have stopped there, or a little before, but Falkner turned the fruit in her hand, inspecting it for lingering shreds of pith and for veins, picking each one off and adding it to a tidy pile on her napkin until the naked fruit rested on her palm, a translucent, unblemished segmented sphere.
On the other side of the table Brady still talked, but Daphne didn’t register a word. She was concentrating on the care with which Falkner pulled each segment away from the rest and cleaned the thin white veins between them, piling the pieces of fruit tidily. There was an entire profile in that set of mannerisms.
The process took the better part of half an hour. When Falkner had finished, she looked up and found Daphne staring. Daphne glanced down quickly.
“Worth?”
She looked up. Falkner was offering her an orange segment, between long fingers. “You looked hungry.”
Daphne smiled awkwardly, waving the segment away, but Falkner didn’t pull it back. “Watching you peel an orange is performance art. I’d never have the patience.”
“Oranges were a treat, when I was growing up. So I made them last.” Falkner shrugged her Mom shrug, the one that was just a dip of one ear towards a shoulder, as if her arms were full of something unwieldy. “Besides, I don’t like the bitter parts. Go on, take it.”
She wasn’t going to put her hand down until Daphne accepted the orange. So Daphne did, and so she wouldn’t have to answer, bit it in half. “Thank you,” she said, when the juice had run down her throat, stinging at the back of her tongue.
“They also taste better when you share them.” Falkner stuffed a segment into her own mouth, leaving Daphne to wonder if she’d imagined that wink.

A Handful of Dust | by Will Shetterly

“The beauty of the world has two edges, one of laughter, one of anguish, cutting the heart asunder.” — Virginia Woolf

Act I
Dallas, TX, February 22, 2001
Every time he used the key, he thought it was the best kind of commitment. A ring says you’re bound. A key says you’re free.
He stepped into the condo without saying a word. Normally, he would call, “Honey, I’m home!” because he knew his sense of humor sucked, but it was the best he had, and while love does not mean never having to say you’re sorry, it does mean a sucky sense of humor will get you a smile. Or a kiss. Or a command to strip fast.
He came in quietly because he expected the place to be quiet. Today was a government holiday, and they had plans to spend the day together until Maria Cortez, age four, went missing in the 66 acres of the Dallas Arboretum. When he had said, “There’s a little deaf girl missing. They want volunteers,” he had instantly heard, “Go be a hero, Danny. The DA’s office is swamped, so I’ll spend the day bailing. Meet tonight at your place for a hero’s return?”
So he had grinned and clipped his shield and weapon under his jacket and hurried away, praying, “Sweet Jesus, please let me want a hero’s return.” Too many bad things happened to lost girls. Each second Maria Cortez was missing increased the odds that she would not be coming back.
But thirty-five minutes after he arrived at the site, a K-9 from Texas Response Unit Search & Rescue had found Maria Cortez napping under a rose bush. So he hadn’t found her? He had answered the call. That’s what heroes do. He figured he deserved a reward.
And he figured he wasn’t the only one. They had both chosen duty over fun. His idea of a nice surprise was coming home to steaks on the grill, cold beer in the fridge, and someone willing to try anything once. Or three times. He had phoned to say Maria Cortez was hugging the nice police doggie, but no one answered. He had considered calling the office, but that’s one of the rules of an affair: don’t call. A good boyfriend knows to let working dogs work.
Since he had been too early to be the surprised, he was happy to be the surpriser. Now, carrying a grocery sack with a six of Coors, two steaks, frozen hash browns, and chopped salad toward the kitchen, he thought, Yeah, man. Good boyfriend. I would so marry me. He glanced down at the two home keys on his ring, nodded in satisfaction, pocketed the ring, and headed in.
Then he frowned. Music came from the back of the condo. One of their rules for being together was that Brady kept his love of country rock in his Mustang and his own apartment.
But someone was playing “The Devil Went Down to Georgia.”

J. Edgar Hoover Building, Washington, D.C., July 18, 2007, 6:15 PM
Esther Falkner was staying late because Ben had called saying his clients were idiots, and the girls were having dinner with their Aunt Gilda, and Esther had spent thirty minutes of the work day composing her best answer to an email that consisted of, “I love you, Mom. Is Dad the only man who doesn’t suck?” She had started reading Lau’s letter to a journalist that explained how the Anomalous Crimes Task Force was the FBI’s version of a cold cases squad when a shadow filled her office doorway and stayed there. “Brady?”
He never waited at the door. Why, she wondered, don’t we notice what people never do until they do it? When the door was open, Brady always marched into her office and stopped in front of her desk as if he was fighting the urge to salute.
At the sound of her voice, he walked in as always. But this time, he set a manila folder on the corner of her desk. “My report.”
She frowned, wondering if she should ask why he hadn’t emailed it. She said, “That could’ve waited until tomorrow.”
He said, “Respectfully, no.” Before she could shape a question, he turned on his heel. She watched his broad back as he walked out and thought, The reporter can wait another day to be bored.
She picked up the folder and glanced inside. Below the date, the report began, “The ACTF’s involvement began this morning at—”

Queens, NY, 2:40 AM
Jennifer Kahn saw the empty parking space and smiled. She would have been home six hours earlier, but her boss at the 76 Club had begged her to work the after-dinner shift for a bartender who called in sick, and the night had dragged on with cranky customers and tiny tips. Now, in the deadest hours of the night, she had been sure she would spend twenty minutes cruising Queens for a space. Finding one so close to home was a gift. It could only have been better if it had been near a street light.
She parked, picked up her cell, speed-dialed, and said, “DH? I got lucky. In about five minutes, so will you.”
The DH said sleepily, “Deal. I’ll dress and be out—”
“Grab a robe and wait by the door. I’m half a block away.”
“Score! Heading down.”
He would want her to stay in the car until he opened the building’s front door, but he was on his way, and they lived in a neighborhood where people looked out for each other, and she had decided in her teens that if her choice was freedom or fear, the decision was easy. So she grabbed her purse, got out of the cool car into the moist night, took two steps for the sidewalk, and froze.
A man lay on his side in the dark shadow of a tree. He had thick stubble on his cheek. His shirt was rumpled as if he’d been wearing it for as long as he hadn’t shaven. He stank of sweat and shit.
She grimaced. The aches in her legs and back reminded her what it meant to work hard. Why shouldn’t she just give up like this bum and stay high all the time?
But she didn’t have to sleep under a tree. He couldn’t be comfortable. She looked back at him. His suit, shirt, and tie were new, rumpled but much more expensive than anyone from this neighborhood would wear.
The DH’s voice came from her cell. “Jen? I thought you were close.”
“Here.” She waved down the block at the figure in the green terrycloth bathrobe by the door to their building.
He waved back. “What’s wrong?”
“Nothing. There’s a guy—”
As she walked around the man, she saw his lips were parted. Something gray filled his mouth and flecked the stubble on his chin. Thick lines were drawn on his forehead.
Not lines. Letters.
Not drawn. Carved.
She stumbled back, gasped, and looked around.
The DH shouted “Jen!” and started running toward her in his flip-flops.
She clicked end on her cell and punched 9-1-1.

Alexandria, VA, 3:20 AM
Daniel Brady was thinking about nothing but sweet sensation when the hookup—Kelly?—said, “You like that?”
Brady grunted, “Unh,” trusting—Kerry?—could hear that Texans don’t talk when talking doesn’t matter, then realized K-whatever—or Cory?—didn’t know him and couldn’t guess what one syllable meant. Feeling generous, he added, “Huh.”
“You like me?”
Enough to be in a strange bed, Brady thought, but knew he couldn’t say. He couldn’t remember Kellykerrycory’s name, but that was part of the rules:
1. When working, forget nothing.
2. When playing, forget everything.
Brady said, “I. Fucking. Love. This.” That must’ve been enough, because then they were just strangers making each other feel like all that mattered was happening and what didn’t matter could wait forever. Kelly or Cory was lean and dark, with rough callused palms. That was good. Brady had always thought his type was lean and dark, until he had met An—
Don’t think of elephants. Corykelly just wants what you want, a good time. Just like— Don’t think of elephants.
Afterward, he wanted to sleep, but Cory or—Kini. The hookup’s name was Kini, or at least, that’s what it was at Someplace Quiet. Kini said, “That was a damn fine ride, Lone Ranger.”
Brady wanted to say his cell was vibrating, but it was in his jacket across the room. He needed to get a Bureau gadgeteer to fix a phone so he could say something that normally would never cross his lips, like “I sure do fancy a latte,” and it would ring. How could he convince a gadgeteer that would help him kill monsters? He said, “Yeah. Glad I ran into you, Silver.”
Kini laughed. “Run into me Friday, same time, same place. I like being run into.”
One of the big rules applied: Don’t lie unless you have to. “Like I said. Tonight only.”
“Oh,” Kini said in a quiet way so much like Andre that Brady wanted to dive naked out the window and risk the three-story fall. Then he laughed in a way that was nothing at at all like Andre and reached for another condom. “Well, hell, Texas, we got hours to go till dawn!”
A rule applied there, too: Never turn down a good time.
Brady grinned. “I reckon so.”
And his cell rang.
“Fuck!” Brady was across the bedroom so fast Kini was staring. Brady said, “Duty,” as he glanced at the screen, praying for a wrong number. He saw what he expected: WTF?
Kini frowned. Brady thought, Question mark. Not a period. Not an exclamation. I could stay for another round or two, and in the morning—
Brady said, “Work. Gotta go,” and began dressing at top speed: jeans, red and black snakeskin Tony Llama’s, a loose white silk shirt.
“You’re a doctor? No way.”
Don’t lie unless you have to. “Fireman. If they call, it’s like to be bad.”
“But—”
He wanted to run out, but he could hear Andre saying, “Damn it, Danny, just ask yourself, ’What would an asshole do?’ and do something else.”
He gave Kini a kiss, said, “Thanks for a great night,” and ran from the apartment toward his pickup and the sweet, dark promise of monsters that could kill him.

J. Edgar Hoover Building, Washington, D. C., 4:35 AM
“The first known victim of the Trash Talking Killer was found in December,” Nikki Lau said as the photo flashed on the briefing room’s monitor. “Amanda Jones, age seventeen. High school student, B-plus average. Cause of death, drowning in a tub of New York City water, based on the traces in her clothes and lungs. Chaz, you can sleep on the plane.”
Chaz Villette slapped his hand over his mouth to hide his yawn and shook his head, making Lau think, as usual, of Charlie at the Daily Coyote website. “Rushing oxygen to the brain,” Chaz said. “People should be complimented when someone yawns in front of them.”
“In the Chazverse,” said Hafidha Gates. She rested her chin on her knuckles while she silently conducted a dialogue with her laptop. Probably pulling in more information about the dead girl and the Trash Talking Killer while IMing either or both of her current flirtations, cute boys in Singapore and Dubai.
Stephen Reyes raised an eyebrow. Lau wondered if he had been a Mr. Spock fan when he was young. Thinking about Stephen Reyes as a young Trekkie was especially difficult at four-thirty in the morning when discussing a murder.
Lau said, “No sign of sexual assault or torture.”
Daniel Brady, who must assume his fellow profilers wouldn’t notice the smell of Unforgivable and sweat or wonder why he was wearing a black T-shirt from his go bag, said, “She looks Asian.”
Lau nodded. The girl on the screen could have been one of her cousins. “Adopted from China.” Lau clicked to the next picture. “ Like all of TTK’s known victims, she was found on a curb in a quiet part of New York City sometime between two and five a.m. In her case, Chinatown’s factory district.”
“Like trash,” Esther Falkner said quietly.
“He was done. He didn’t need a dump site he could linger at or revisit,” Reyes suggested.
Sol Todd asked, “Is TTK a name he chose?”
Lau shook her head. “Thank the Post. It’s purely for his signature.” She clicked to a close-up of the dead girl’s face. “After death, her mouth was stuffed with dirt, almost certainly from a vacuum cleaner. Its owner likes Rice Crispies and short-haired gray cats.”
“DNA present?” Daphne Worth asked, in ears-pricked posture.
“Not that matches anyone in the NCIC database.”
She clicked to the next image. “Janice McArthur. Age seventy-two. Cause of death, asphyxiation. She successfully swallowed the first joints of her eight smaller toes, but she choked to death on her left big toe. Her right big toe was nicked, as if TTK started to cut it, then saw she was dying. The bruising on her wrists and ankles is consistent with steel handcuffs. No sign of sexual assault.”
Lau clicked to the next, a man whose skin was even darker than Reyes’. “Three weeks later, Rodney Johnson of Athens, Georgia, an insurance adjuster visiting for a conference, was found in Brooklyn. Age fifty-four.” She kept from glancing at Todd; everyone except Worth had been at Todd’s fifty-fourth birthday. “Wrists and ankles had rope burns. Fingernails and toenails were torn out. Body was covered with cigarette burns. Cause of death was cardiac arrest. His wife and a female prostitute that he frequented believe he was exclusively heterosexual, but there was semen in his stomach and anus. Which does match the DNA found on the previous victims.”
Lau heard a sound that Brady sometimes made, a tock! with his tongue against the roof of his mouth like the cocking of a gun, but she didn’t look at him, either.
Worth frowned. “Is TTK a team? Drowning, torture...”
Chaz added, “Did I miss what’s anomalous about this? It’s weird, but—”
Lau raised her index and said, “Ah,” channeling her mother. “There are more.” She clicked the screen. “Mohammad Hussein from Queens. Accountant. Age twenty-seven. Cause of death, sudden cardiac arrest. But he had no history of heart disease. If he hadn’t been found on a curb with a mouthful of dirt, no one would’ve thought there was foul play.”
Reyes said, “Frost saw his files?”
Lau nodded. “And pronounced them boring.” She clicked to the next picture. “John Waters. Barrista. Age thirty-two. Cause of death, cardiac arrest. No history of heart trouble. Frost said still boring.” Lau clicked again. “Marilyn Leister-Rose. Lawyer. Age twenty-nine, cardiac arrest. Frost said repetition is especially boring.” She clicked again. “Susan Watkins. Hairdresser. Age forty-two. Cardiac arrest. Frost said repetition may be suspicious, but it’s still boring.”
“The first cases fit a torture scenario,” Worth said. “But to go from torture to inducing heart attacks? If it was the same UNSUB, wouldn’t the cruelty get worse?”
“How often could a gamma kill and revive someone?” Chaz asked.
Lau, listening to the quiet room, thought, Every time I think he’s a sweet boy, he says something like that.
Reyes narrowed his eyes at the monitor. “Would multiple heart attacks in a short period of time show up in an autopsy?”
“I’ll call Frost—”
“Before breakfast, with something that could be boring? It can wait for office hours.”
She smiled gratefully and clicked again. A shot of a man lying on a curb. “The latest. Walter Mascomb of Peoria, Illinois. He and his wife came to New York for a theater weekend three days ago. He went out after lunch to visit book stores. He was found a little over an hour ago. Preliminary investigation shows no obvious cause of death. But he had a mouth full of dirt.” She clicked to a close-up of the man’s forehead. “And this.”
The letters carved into his forehead spelled in block print, “FEAR.”
Worth said, “That was done after he died.”
Lau nodded.
Brady said, “He’s escalating. Or they are.”
“It’s a message,” Reyes said. “He wants more than he’s getting.”
Hafidha said, “Could be initials. F.E.A.R. I’ll search—”
Sol Todd raised his hand, then turned it over, cupped. “A couple ounces from a vacuum cleaner? Like a handful?”
Lau nodded.
“’I will show you fear in a handful of dust.’ T. S. Eliot. The Wasteland. He’s giving us a clue.”
“Which proves he’s a gamma?” asked Chaz.
“Or an English professor?” asked Worth. “Or a writer?”
Todd shrugged. “Proves he can Google a good quote.”
“Hound of the Baskervilles,” Hafidha said without looking up from her screen.
Todd smiled. “Never took you for a Sherlockian, my good Miss Gates.”
Hafidha glanced up at him. “It’s elementary, my dear Todd. Jeremy Brett’s hot.”
Worth said, “Uh, should I say, ’huh?’ or just squint and scratch my head?”
“Sir Baskerville died of a heart attack,” Chaz told her. “Induced by fear. There’ve been studies after earthquakes and air raids. Death rates soar. But it mostly affects the elderly—”
Hafidha, staring back at her monitor, said, “I got a doctor saying children with no prior heart disease have died on amusement park rides.”
Falkner said, “Terrified to death. Like trapped birds.” She looked at Lau.
Right. Herd the cats. Lau clicked again. A balding, middle-aged man with a fringe of beard and wire-rimmed glasses appeared on screen. “Tony D’Angelo, jazz guitarist. He didn’t show up for a Greenwich Village gig after flying from LA to JFK.”
“Jazz musicians—” Reyes began.
“He never missed a gig. His manager said he got more work for being dependable than for being brilliant.” Realizing she had cut him off, Lau hesitated. Reyes nodded slightly, and she thought, Ah. Rudeness is fine with the boss when it’s efficient. I mustn’t abuse this power.
Falkner said, “Is there a reason to connect D’Angelo and TTK?”
Lau shook her head., “We just know there’s no good reason for D’Angelo to be missing, and TTK’s timing is speeding up. The last three were in the last twenty days. Even if the next isn’t D’Angelo, and TTK isn’t a gamma, my friend expects another body soon.” She turned toward Reyes’ frown. “Detective Victor Zhiang of the Fifth Precinct.” She saw Chaz flinch at the name. Chaz was always easier to read when he was underslept.
Reyes said, “That’s it?”
Lau nodded, hiding a sudden worry. When Vic’s call woke her, the case had screamed gamma, gamma, gamma. But now, if Reyes thought she had wasted everyone’s time—
Reyes looked around the room.
Brady said, “Someone might have a source for heart attack victims.”
Falkner glanced at him. “You think that’s likely?”
Brady shook his head. “Just wanted to check it off the list.”
Worth said, “I can’t think of a way to induce heart attacks that doesn’t leave electrical burns or drug residue.”
Reyes lifted his chin. “What’s different about the last victim?” The Stephen Reyes School of Socratic Profiling, Brady called it. Lau bit the side of her tongue to keep back an inappropriate snicker.
“The disfigurement,” Chaz answered promptly.
Falkner leaned forward, one hand on the back of Brady’s chair. “Specifically, the word ’Fear.’ That’s what he wants.”
Reyes smiled. “The random targeting of victims. The apparently impossible cause of death. The public dumping of the bodies. Even dropping the torture components: the most horrific details aren’t as frightening as what you can’t see. What you can only imagine.”
“Scaring the victims isn’t enough for him now.” Brady’s voice was rough with lack of sleep, and maybe something else, too. “He wants to scare the city.”
Reyes turned his hands palms-up, a magician’s reveal. “The dirt in the mouth. You will return to dust. I have that power over any one of you. The city was missing the message, so he wrote it on the victim’s forehead.”
“And the anomaly seeks to maximize pain.” Todd sat back in his chair and shoved his hands in his jacket pockets.
Chaz nodded “I don’t have to be pattern-boy to know the odds—”
“Say which way to bet,” Hafidha finished.
Todd said, “My spider sense is tingling.”
“We might be able to help,” Falkner said. “Even if it’s not a gamma.”
Reyes turned his gaze to Lau. “They called. We should reinforce that by going.” He glanced around the briefing room. “Lau, you and Brady.” He tightened his lips. “Chaz. And—” He glanced from Worth to Todd.
Todd stretched. “New York’s the sixth circle of hell, but that’s my favorite.”
“Todd,” Reyes agreed, pushing his chair back from the table. “The rest of you, go home and sleep late. That’s an order.”
Falkner said, “If there’s a gamma who’s killed eight or more people—”
“Then I need a well-rested backup team,” Reyes said. “And I get to argue for a bigger discretionary budget.” He looked at Lau, Brady, Chaz, and Todd. “Don’t do anything to improve my case.”
Todd said, “Miz Todd didn’t raise no heroes.”
Reyes gave his rare, sudden smile. “Good. Just remember—”
Chaz said, “We don’t learn anything from dead gammas.”
Brady grunted, or maybe just cleared his throat, and looked at the ceiling.
Reyes’ smile grew wider as he stood. “My work here is done. Any of the rest of you wants to make brownie points, show up at 10:55. I’ll be in at eleven. And, for the record, if you get a question mark call in the middle of the night—” He turned his gaze to Falkner. “And you’ve got family—” He looked at Worth. “Or someone you think of as family—” He looked at Brady. “Or you’re just having a good night, do not come in.”
Falkner said, “Everyone knows that.”
“It’s the obeying part that concerns me.”
“And do you take your own advice, Herr Doktor?” Hafidha asked.
Reyes paused at the door. “I have an obsession, Agent Gates. That gets people killed. So I need the rest of you to have professions.”
As Hafidha’s expression softened slightly, Brady said, “I hear that.”
Good old cowboy, Lau thought. Nothing fazes him.
Act II
Dallas, TX, February 22, 2001
The bedside alarm must’ve gone off accidentally. But if so, why was it playing Charlie Daniels, and why was it playing loudly? Andre liked quiet music that demanded all your attention or let you talk over it.
Brady turned from the kitchen and started down the hall. The carpet was quiet under his boots. The grocery sack hung heavily from his left fist. Was there a smell he didn’t recognize, a strange aftershave, or was he imagining things?
Maybe Andre had the same idea he did. Maybe Andre was in the bedroom preparing a surprise, and the honkytonk was setting the mood. Brady liked that notion. He should tiptoe out of the condo and wait for Andre’s call, or maybe come in again, calling Andre’s name—
But Andre had said he would come to Brady’s house.
It didn’t make sense. Which was fine. Whatever it was was Andre’s business. A good boyfriend knew to respect—
Brady heard a moan, just below the devil’s driving fiddlework. Not a moan he had ever heard. Andre was with someone.
He stopped still in the hall. What did that mean? Not long after they had exchanged keys, they had said they were too old for the party scene. Why not settle down and play safe?
He thought, Okay. Andre decided to have some fun without me. Ain’t no reason to go all Gloomy Gus. Head on home and hear him out when he calls. If he calls. Of course he’ll call. Christ, Brady, don’t be an asshole about this. Just get the fuck out fast and pretend you’re the most macho cowboy ever when he calls. A gentleman in a gentlemen’s couple’s entitled to a gentleman friend, right? Decide later if this is something a cowboy should cry about.
Biting his lower lip, he turned back toward the living room.
And as he turned, he heard a gasp cutting through the music. Not pleasure. Pain. Some fuckhead’s hurting Andre! he thought, hitting the bedroom door with the heel of his hand, slamming it open.

July 18, 2007
Tony D’Angelo listened to his heart. The room muffled sound, making each beat grow dull and drain away, like dampening a drum. If— When he got out, he would use that. A Poe concept album. Tell-tale Heart. Cask of Amontillado. That one with the swinging blade, lowering with each pass.
Did Poe stories ever end well?
He didn’t want to think about the ammonia smell of the mattress under him. Maybe it was good he couldn’t see anything.
But nothing he could see would be worse than what he could imagine. Would it?
Think positive. He couldn’t smell anything worse than ammonia. He couldn’t hear anything worse than his heart. He couldn’t feel anything around him besides the mattress beneath him, the cool air around him, and the smooth bands of fabric covering his eyes and binding his wrists and ankles.
Did someone think a New York gig meant he had money? Leaving his family for a night meant he needed money. Did they mistake him for the front man? He wasn’t someone a kidnapper would target. L.A. was full of session musicians at least as good as he was. Did anyone even know he was missing yet? Why had he told Cassie it would be a late night, so he would call in the morning? The club had undoubtedly cursed his name and started phoning every local player who might be free. They wouldn’t even bitch about him to his agent yet.
Was his ax all right? Bad enough to be locked in the dark for no reason. But if he got out, he would really like to have his favorite guitar, too.
What if they wanted to cut off a finger to mail to someone? Why couldn’t he think of any nine-fingered session guitarists?
Don’t think about why the room muffles sound. Maybe there are just a lot of drapes or cardboard around. What’s creepier, being trapped in a room designed as a cage or in one that simply works as a cage?
Depends on who caged him.
Was it morning? Were Aretha and Billie asking Cassie when Daddy was coming home? Why had he accepted a gig on the right side of the continent when everything he needed was on the left?
He twisted suddenly, testing his bonds. The cloth didn’t give. Cloth must mean no one wanted to hurt him, right?
He wanted to sleep, but how do you defend yourself when you’re asleep?
He thrashed with all his strength, knowing that doing nothing would do nothing, but doing something might make things worse. His heartbeat rocketed, a pure heavy metal-beat: break free kill the fucker, break free kill the fucker, break free kill the fucker—
And as each beat died in the cool, stale air, it whimpered, Dear god don’t let me die, dear god—
This wasn’t about money.

Fifth Precinct, New York City, NY, 7:30 AM
In the bustling front room of New York’s oldest station house , smiling at them—no, at Lau—as they approached, Detective Zhiang looked way too much like Tony Leung for Chaz to like him. No one who looked like a Hong Kong pop star should be calling Nikki Lau in the middle of the night.
Zhiang said, “Nikki. Glad you could come.”
Chaz thought, On the job now. Grow up, Chaz.
Then Lau’s smile made him think, If Zhiang makes her smile like that, he better be okay. Lau said, “Likewise, Vic. Meet Special Agents Sol Todd, Daniel Brady, and Chaz Villette.”
Zhiang shook hands with Todd and Brady. “I’ve heard a lot about you two.”
Todd said, “Outrageous lies. When I use both hands, I can find my ass with ease.”
Brady added, “Once I lend him a mirror.”
Zhiang grinned. Cops always seemed to know how to talk to other cops. Zhiang turned to Chaz. His handshake was too perfectly firm. He said, “Since you’re working with Nikki, I know I’ll hear good things about you, too.”
Chaz nodded. So Lau didn’t talk about him. Better that than one of the alternatives. Be manly. If you tighten up, your voice will get higher. Better yet, do the Brady thing and say nothing. He said, “This is the old Five Points neighborhood. That’s so cool!”
As Chaz thought, What part of say nothing didn’t I understand? Zhiang nodded. “The neighborhood’s gotten boring lately. But not boring enough.” He led them deeper into the station house. “I’d offer you coffee, but trust me, you don’t want it.”
Chaz held up his coffee cup and a bag of bagels. “Merit badge in urban survival.”
Which made Lau smile. If all you can be is someone’s clown, well, that’s a privilege you should treasure.
The break room was larger than the WTF’s briefing room. But no matter how much Victor Zhiang looked like Tony Leung, he did not have a jet. Unfortunately, Chaz saw no way to slip that into the conversation.
As they sat, Lau said, “What else can you tell us?”
“Besides what you have already?” Zhiang shrugged. “Amanda Jones had a boyfriend her parents didn’t know about. He was at a birthday party upstate that night. John Waters was into the S&M club scene. The night he disappeared, he’d been at a wedding party that was whitebread enough for the Disney channel.”
Todd shuddered. “Don’t get me going about Disney and innocence.”
Zhiang said, “Touché. But we didn’t find anything interesting there. Janice McArthur went to a matinee of “Rent” with a man she was secretly seeing, the husband of a dying friend, but he says they simply planned to keep their relationship a secret until after the friend’s death. That’s confirmed by another friend, so there’s no reason to suspect him. All I see is every one of TTK’s victims left their homes or hotels, and none of them came back. I was hoping you’d see what I’m missing.”
Chaz watched Lau put on her most serene and Falkner-like face. Police departments—even the NYPD—called the FBI in to work miracles. You didn’t want to shake their faith right out of the gate. “If you could look again at anyone, Vic, who would it be?”
“Thought you don’t like speculation.”
Brady said, “Not from the Post. Lead detective on the case gets special treatment.”
Zhiang flipped open a folder, handed Lau two sheets of paper, and pointed at one. “This guy just icks me. Christopher Fung.” Chaz craned his neck to see the photo: a young man with a hollow, sullen expression and a buzz cut, his head pushed forward on his heavy neck. “He did time for raping an Asian-American girl, got released, and two months later, young Asian-American women were getting raped. Most years, there are very few reported rapes in this area. Last year, five from May to November, all similar. Maybe it’s coincidence, but Fung’s stories for those nights are weak—either he says he was home or at a club or can’t remember.”
Not quite one a month—Chaz craned to look at the file again—and not at regular intervals. TTK’s schedule was similar, until the last three victims.
“DNA?” Lau asked.
“Fung was two days past his eighteenth birthday when he was arrested. The girl knew him by sight, identified him, and he pled guilty almost immediately. Somebody decided they didn’t need to collect DNA.”
Brady clicked his teeth together so firmly Chaz could hear it.
Chaz swallowed the last of his coffee. “The rapes stopped in November?”
Zhiang nodded. “Or his M.O. changed, or his hunting ground did. Or it wasn’t Fung, and somebody killed the shithead and dumped him in the East River, which happens. Why?”
“TTK started a month later.”
“You’re connecting him through Amanda Jones? Do you know how many young Asian-American women live in New York City?”
Chaz opened his mouth. Brady said, “Smart money says he does.” Chaz pretended there was still coffee in his cup and he’d opened his mouth to finish it.
Zhiang said, “Okay, the timing fits. But a change of M.O. like that—”
“Anomalous crimes, Detective,” Todd said. “For what we hunt, a new M.O. might be irrelevant.”
“Even with a change of target?”
“Sometimes they think they want one thing,” Chaz said. “Then they decide on another.”
Lau said, “Tell me about the unsolved rapes.”
Zhiang closed his eyes, then opened them. “The women returned home at their usual times, close to midnight thanks to work or school. A man, Asian-American, maybe twenty-five or thirty, in a dark jacket with the hood up, came from behind as they approached their door, put a knife to their back, and said he would kill them if they looked at his face or made trouble.”
“But they identified him as Asian-American?”
“They were all sure. Though they said he talked like a gangbanger.”
Chaz said, “Part of his disguise?”
Brady said, “And getting into character.”
Lau asked, “Then he made them take him inside?”
“Yeah,” Zhiang said. “Where he took his time. He never cut them, but he would stroke the blade on their skin to watch them cringe. If they had pubic hair, he would shave them. He told them to beg for their lives while he raped them. He made them wash after. He always took away his condoms.” Zhiang exhaled as if the air conditioned room suddenly stank. “Need more? I can send the files.”
Fear, Chaz thought. What if it wasn’t about the rape so much as the fear? He looked out of the corner of his eye at Brady and Lau. They’d registered the same info.
Lau asked, “What did Christopher Fung do?”
“He raped a fourteen-year-old in her laundry room. So there’s escalation, but it fits, far as I can tell. Lock them up, and some just come out smarter and meaner.”
Lau frowned at the second sheet Zhiang had given her. “What about this?” Chaz couldn’t quite read the typed statement from where he sat.
Zhiang said, “On the night Amanda Jones died, a drunk called 9-1-1 saying a cab nearly hit him, and he got the plate. But the leasing company says that cab never left the lot that night. So even if the drunk didn’t imagine it, it’s useless. Any or all of the numbers could be wrong.”
Chaz said, “Hafidha could run the combinations. You never know.”
Lau nodded. “Someone should see if Christopher Fung has an alibi for last night. Or any of the nights that TTK left a victim. Chaz, Todd, he’s all yours. Brady and I can talk to the cab company.”
Chaz thought, If Fung is the best suspect, why wouldn’t Lau— Oh. Fung raped one Asian-American girl. Lau wants someone who won’t assume he raped the others.
That must be Todd.

Somewhere, sometime, darkness.
Tony D’Angelo heard the soft click of metal, then something so subtle he couldn’t name it, another person’s breathing, another person’s heartbeat. Should he struggle? Playing dead made him think of being dead. What would help? He needed to pee. He needed someone to care.
As the gag was pulled free, he said, “Please. Whatever you want, I’ll cooperate, honest.”
“Yeah, Anthony. Fact, that.” A man’s voice. Tenor. New Yorker. No one Tony had ever heard.
He called him Anthony. The man didn’t know who he was. Was that good? In the army, they’d said if you were captured, make your captor see you as a person, not a target. Was there a difference between an enemy soldier and whoever this was?
He said tentatively, “Tony. Everybody calls me Tony. My wife, my daughters, my friends, everybody.”
“Sure thing. I’ll call you Tony-o. You call me Mr. Black.”
He’s playing with me. Does his game have rules? Can we both win? Tony said, “What do you want? Uh, from me? Mr. Black?”
“Answer me a question is all.”
Tony nodded. When he heard nothing, he said, “I will, Mr. Black.”
“What terrifies you most? What’s the nightmare so bad you can’t sleep for hours afterward? What’s piss-yourself and pray-to-die scary?”
Should he play tough? That would only make the man want to weaken him. Make him think he’s in control, and maybe he’ll slip up. “This. Totally. My wife says I ’m a baby about being helpless—”
“No, no, Tony-o. Leave your wife out of this. It’s just you and me. And you think this is scary, which I like, Tony-o. But we haven’t even begun to begin. So. What scares you so much you can’t tell anyone?”
Vampires, Tony thought. Falling. He felt like he was on speed, bad speed, way too much speed cut with something evil. Slow, painful death. Who’s not afraid of slow, painful death? He said, “All kinds of things scare me, Mr. Black. My girls say I’m a total fraidy-cat. We don’t have much money, but it’s yours. We’ve got friends. We can get you money. No one has to know. Please, just tell me—”
Soft hands touched his cheeks, like someone planning to kiss him. Tony jerked in surprise, but the cloth bonds kept him from doing more than rocking back. What did this man want? Everyone wanted something. If he could just figure out what the guy wanted, he could get him to stop scaring him.
“Eyes,” the man said as if savoring the word.
Tony winced as the blindfold was jerked from his head. Mr. Black was slender, Asian, grinning hard, with hair so short it might have been shaved a week or two before. He wore a black T-shirt, black jeans, black running shoes.
A single bare bulb burned overhead, a compact fluorescent. The room had no windows. The floor was concrete with rust-colored stains near the old futon Tony lay on. The walls were thick blue insulation panels. The door was another blue panel, cut to fit into a three-by-six door frame.
Movie posters had been taped to the walls. Without his glasses, Tony couldn’t read all of them, but he saw enough to guess what sort the rest must be: Taxi Driver. Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Saw. Psycho. The Shining. Les Diaboliques.
Eyes? If Mr. Black didn’t know him, he couldn’t have read the interview where Tony had said no matter how painless, cheap, or fast it was, he could never get Lasik.
Mr. Black said, “Ever see An Andalusian Dog, Tony-o?”
Was that a band? A show? Why was a madman asking— The razor slicing an eye movie. Tony winced and shook his head.
“No, I didn’t think so. It’s not the kind of film just anyone would see.” Mr. Black turned and went to the door.
Tony called, “Please! Whatever you want—”
“I’ll get. Don’t worry. I’m going to make something special for you now.”
Food? He wasn’t hungry. If the man brought food, would he dare eat it? When Mr. Black opened the door, Tony could see a long, narrow room beyond it, and part of what might be a sink, and beyond that a large, dark room with rectangle shapes stacked on a table.
Keep him from talking about eyes. Don’t ask about my glasses. Tony said, “Can I—know something? Why me?”
“Good question, Tony-o. You ask God that?”
Tony nodded. “Sometimes. I’m more spiritual than religious, but we take the girls to church, and I pray.”
“Then be happy, Tony-o. I’m God’s answer.”
The door closed. A moment later, the light went out. In the darkness, Tony’s heart played the bass part to, Please god save me, please god save me, please god save—
Act III
New York City, NY, 8:15 AM
As Chaz drove the congested streets of Chinatown, terrifying drivers in yellow cabs, white and blue buses, battered delivery trucks, and gleaming vanity cars, he told Todd, “I’ve got a theory.”
Todd resisted the temptation to grab for the dashboard for the half-dozenth time. “That it’s good to die like James Dean?”
Chaz grinned. “We can’t get up sufficient velocity here. Besides, don’t take anyone with you. Matter of principle.”
“Ah, Grasshopper, it is good to have theories. That’s my theory. What’s yours?”
“Power corrupts.”
“Pithy. I like it. Better hope Lord Acton doesn’t steal it from you.”
“I think it’s the difference between gammas and betas. Gammas want power.”
Todd snuck a look at Chaz’s profile—which was, just then, in profile, thank God, since one ought to be looking out the windshield when a produce van was backing out of a blind alley in front of one’s car. Usually he liked to let someone else drive. He could let his mind do as it pleased that way. With Chaz driving, his mind mostly wanted to scream We’re going to die! “You don’t want power?”
Chaz rolled his head and his eyes at Todd, and Todd pretended he wasn’t holding his breath. “Yeah, right. Emperor Norton, maybe.”
“Should I say something about protesting too much?”
“I don’t mean I want to be powerless.” He shrugged one of his odd many-jointed shrugs. “Just...free to do what I want.”
“And who has that much power?”
Chaz’s flat-lipped grin was one of the ones that didn’t really mean grin. “Fuck. It was a good theory, though.”
Todd studied his flattened mouth, the tightness in his bony jaw and shoulders. “This is about Hafidha going off the grid?”
A puff of exhale. Yes, child, Uncle Duke is a profiler, too.
“Uh. Yeah.”
Todd nodded. “There’s power she loves. Power to delight. Power to surprise. Power to help. You want my theory on gammas and betas?”
“Is it a Duke theory or a Sol theory?”
“Is there a difference?”
Chaz grinned. “A Sol theory’s a koan. A Duke theory’s a very long-haired dog.”
Todd shook his head. “I thought I was the one who did too many drugs in his youth.”
“I’m listening, I’m listening.”
“You are too kind, Grasshopper. My theory is gammas are control freaks. The world terrifies them, so they impose their myths. Betas like live-and-let-live.”
“That’s it?”
“In the next draft, I’ll add something about fluoridation and Latin mottos on our money.”
Chaz laughed and dodged a bicycle messenger. Todd was grateful for both. “So we mostly find gammas because most people are control freaks? Duke, in the language of your tribe, that theory’s a major bummer.”
“Grasshopper, you miss an implication. We could be surrounded by betas, and we wouldn’t know it because they’re all living-and-let-living.”
“Oh. That’s a sweet theory.”
Todd nodded. “Yes. It is. But not so sweet you shouldn’t watch the road.”
Chaz slammed the brakes to keep from rear-ending a taxi cutting in front of him. Todd rocked against his seat belt, then said, “Or we could be surrounded by gammas just waiting to pounce.”

•

Christopher Fung’s address was a door half-hidden between a video store and a fish market. Chaz parked in the alley three storefronts down, and they walked past a window full of posters for new Hong Kong movies, and CDs either by or about beautiful Asian women. Todd couldn’t remember enough Chinese to tell which.
“Lau screwed up,” he said.
Chaz blinked at him. “She never screws up.”
“Who’s going to be the bad cop?”
Chaz jerked to a stop. “Damn. She should’ve sent you and Brady.”
“Not you and Brady?”
Chaz’s mouth twisted; he looked sidelong at Todd, as if he’d just had a moment of self-knowledge that he felt he should have had long ago. Which, Todd, suspected, was true. Chaz said, as if Todd might have forgotten, “Fung’s a rapist.”
Todd nodded. “She didn’t screw up. You’ll make a fine bad cop.”
Six buzzers, all with names beside them. Two of them were in both English and Chinese characters, including Fung’s. He pressed the buzzer, then looked up at the camera mounted above the security door.
A woman’s voice said, “Yes?”
They held up their badges. Chaz said, “FBI. We’re here to see Christopher Fung.”
“FBI? Why?”
“We’d rather discuss that with Mr. Fung.”
“I come down.”
A moment later, a stout young Asian woman in red capris and a Hello Kitty T-shirt opened the door, saying, “What you want? Chris sleeping now.”
Chaz glanced at Todd, then said, “He was out last night? Do you know where—”
“He not go out! My son sick! Crying all night with sore throat. Chris sit up with him so I sleep. I got work. What kinda shit this, you make trouble for us?”
Chaz said, “You’re— Are you married to Mr. Fung?”
“FBI business, people get married? Green card? Yeah, we married.”
“Mrs. Fung,” Todd said, doing his best to sound meek and mild. “We do need to talk to your husband.”
Mrs. Fung said something in Chinese that was probably not polite, and headed back up the stairs. She let them catch the door and follow her as they could.
The apartments were arranged three to a floor, with the hallway down one side. The front doors of all the apartments were open, because the three tiny windows in the hallway opened into the air shaft between the buildings. If anyone wanted cross-ventilation in the July heat, they would have to give up privacy. Conversations in English and Chinese and Hmong came out each door and scrambled in the hall.
Christopher Fung was asleep on the sleeper sofa in the tiny living room. Beyond him was a curtained doorway, the fabric drawn closed. Chaz shifted nervously from foot to foot. Todd made sure his weapon was accessible, though he was increasingly certain he wouldn’t need it.
Mrs. Fung leaned over her husband. “Chris,” she murmured. “You wake up. Wake up now. Police come again.”
Fung frowned, knuckled his eyes, sat up. He’d been sleeping on top of the covers in a t-shirt and warm-up pants. Given that his bedroom was the front room of an apartment with the hall door standing open, Todd thought that was a good idea.
Fung weighed more than he had in his mug shot. Chaz sent Todd a quick, blank-faced look before he said, “Mr. Fung, we’re agents Villette and Todd with the FBI. We need to ask about—we need to know where you were last night.”
“FBI?” Fung repeated. His mouth hung open.
“Mr. Fung, a man was murdered last night—”
Fung stared.
Chaz’s hands rose just enough for Todd to wonder what he could possibly want to do with them. Then they dropped. “The murder may be connected to a series of rapes that occurred in the second half of last year.”
“Oh, Jesus,” Fung said. He folded forward over his knees, laced his fingers together hard, and muttered, “Please make this go away.”
Mrs. Fung crouched beside him and put her arms around his shoulders.
“Where were you last night?” Chaz asked again, but not like a stern agent of justice.
Fung drew a long, shaking breath. “Every time something bad happens, the cops come ask me where I was.” He spoke softly, softer than the clamor of the neighbors along the hall. “I was here all last night. My boy’s sick. I hurt that girl that once. But I was a kid. I’m sorry now.”
“It was a lot more than hurt,” Chaz said, “and eighteen isn’t a kid.” Todd didn’t think the Fungs would notice the little vibrating edge in Chaz’s voice.
Fung clutched at his face, dragged his fingers down it. “I know. I been sorry ever since. I asked Jesus’s help in prison. I’m sorry for what I did.”
Mrs. Fung glared up at Chaz, but tears ran down her face. “Every day, he pray for poor girl, that Jesus take away hurt.”
“And that’s good enough for you?”
“No! Never good enough!” She kept her voice low. The child’s bed would be behind the curtain. “But he work hard for me, my son, give to church, work with boys who make mistakes. You believe in, in redemption? Believe in Jesus? Believe in Buddha? Believe you can do bad, and learn, and do good?”
“Uh, I...don’t—” Chaz looked at Todd.
“Yes, ma’am,” Todd said softly. “I do.”
Chaz watched him out the corner of his eye, like a nervous horse.
“Then you leave us alone?”
Todd said, “When were you married?”
Fung answered him. “February. Why?”
“You’ve lived here since then?”
Mrs. Fung nodded, frowning, maybe trying to figure out what she’d just committed herself to.
“Mr. Fung, did you leave the apartment at all last night?”
“I told you. No. Joey’s sick.” He said it with a jerk of his head toward the curtained doorway.
“Mrs. Fung, are you sure your husband was here all night?”
“I wake up, go look on my son. One time, Chris read to him. One time, he give him water. Two times, he sleep in chair by his bed. He no sneak out.”
Todd nodded. “Thank you, Mr. Fung. Mrs. Fung. I apologize for the inconvenience.”
He headed for the front door, and felt Chaz close behind him.
“Definitely not a gamma,” Chaz muttered.
“And not TTK. His wife woke up four times. She’s a light sleeper. He’d have to get past her on the couch to leave the apartment...and past the neighbors. And TTK has to have a torture room with easy access. The Fungs...”
“Yeah,” said Chaz. He paused at the top of the stairs, head cocked. “You believe in God?”
“I believe in redemption. On even-numbered days, at least.”
Chaz’s mouth worked, but whatever the argument was, he decided against it. They jogged down the stairs in silence.
When they reached the street, Chaz said, “I am the worst bad cop. Ever.”
Todd nodded. “One of the reasons we like you, Grasshopper.”
“Doesn’t that mean we shouldn’t like Brady?”
Todd shrugged. “Danny Brady needs to be Danny Brady.”

8:30 AM
The first-shift lead dispatcher leaned across the counter in the office of the Siung Taxi Company. She was a small, white-haired woman; light glinted off her Star of David earrings as she looked from Lau’s Bureau ID to Brady’s. “Aren’t you supposed to have a warrant or something?”
Brady said, “Only if you’re not feeling helpful.”
Lau kept her face professional and emotionless. Inwardly she was grinning. Brady had a way of saying those things in an innocuous voice that made them hit a second later and an order of magnitude harder than any tough-guy affect would manage.
The dispatcher eyed him warily. Then she gestured around the small, crowded office where a handful of dispatchers spoke on phones in at least four languages. “I am busy.”
Lau said, “We’re patient. Famous for it.”
Brady added, “If someone did drive that taxi off the lot that night, he or she saw something that might help us catch a serial killer.”
The dispatcher touched her earring, bit her lip, then said, “I’d like to help, honest. But the cab with that license did not leave the lot. The office is open twenty-four-seven. The night guys on the gate have been with us for years. I trust them better than I trust myself. The only cabs that went out are on file.”
Lau said, “Could someone alter the records?”
The dispatcher laughed. “Sure. But a hacker could make a lot more money working someplace else.”
Lau thought, Hafs can check the files. Then she admired the ease of Brady’s Texas smile as he said, “Ma’am, we’d surely be grateful if we could double-check with whoever was in charge that night.”
The dispatcher shrugged and tapped her keyboard. “December— Ah. Figures. Jason Saito.”
Brady and Lau glanced at each other. Lau said, “Figures?”
“He was on drugs. His work never really suffered, not so there was a reason to let him go, but he just started acting crazy, you know? It was heroin, you could tell.”
The woman at the desk behind her snorted.
“What do you know?” the dispatcher snarled. “It was.”
“Crystal meth. They lose weight like that.” The woman at the desk snapped her fingers.
Brady raised his chin. “A lot of weight?”
“Like in Schindler’s List.” The dispatcher shook her head. “Drugs’ll do that.”
Lau said, “Did something happen that would’ve hit him hard?”
“He said his wife left him.”
“When was that?” Brady asked.
“Right when he started.” The dispatcher glanced at her screen again. “May of last year. Why anybody would marry a guy like that...”
“When do you expect him in?”
“He quit a month ago. But we’ve got a home address—”
Act IV
8:45 AM
Saito’s address was an old tan brick four-story warehouse, the smallest on a street of factories and warehouses. A sign at the front gave a number to call, because the building would soon be converted to “affordable luxury lofts.”
A yellow cab was parked in front. As they headed toward the front door, Lau frowned at it. What’s wrong with this picture?
Brady glanced back. “What?”
“Can’t fool an Angelina about body work. That’s an amateur spray job. And the lettering—”
“Saving a buck is good American business.”
“Tinted windows.” Lau cupped her hands to peer into the back of the cab. “Lock buttons are gone. Pull the door shut, and you’re locked in.”
She thumbed in Todd’s number. When he answered, she said, “We’re at Jason Saito’s. How quickly can you get here?”
“With Chaz driving?” Todd replied. “Under ten minutes.”
“Has anyone heard from Tony D’Angelo?”
“Not a word. His wife’s frantic.”
“Call Vic. Tell him to get down here, and bring the big boys. And don’t wait for him.” Lau disconnected.
Brady scowled at the taxi. “Bastard didn’t sneak a cab out. He snuck the plates out in case a cop ran the number.” He bounded for the entrance, taking the four steps in a single leap, and tried the latch.
There were five labeled buzzers on a box between the door and a narrow frosted window. One per floor, and one for the basement. The top four displayed names of companies, faded typewriter ink on yellowed paper. The bottom one was hand-lettered, still white: “J. Saito.”
Lau jabbed each of the top four buttons once. If the commercial tenants were gone, there were no bystanders to warn. She listened to the rumbling of Manhattan in the silence that followed, breathed in the odor of trash and diesel fumes. If nothing came up this weekend, she was going to hike someplace where the air smelled like pine sap.
“No one home.” Brady stepped back, staring at the steel door, then at the window beside it.
“We should wait for backup.”
“D’Angelo has a wife and two daughters.”
Lau sighed. The contractor had begun to gut the old offices; a corroded sink drain pipe lay in a heap of crumbled wallboard beside the dumpster. She picked it up, judged its weight.
“Someone broke in. We should notify a tenant.” She swung the pipe. The frosted glass of the window splintered.
Too loud! She knocked shards out of the frame, reached through the hole to push the panic bar. Adrenaline, triggered by noise and her own hunting instinct, said hurryhurryhurry. She knew better. But her breath still came quick and shallow, her heart still pounded.
Brady caught the door in his left hand as he drew his weapon with his right. Lau drew hers, held it low to the right in both hands. She caught the door with her hip as she followed Brady in.
The cowboy’s taking point. Because no one’s likely to come from behind here? Or so he gets first shot at it? Or so it gets first shot at him? She followed, promising that if somehow Saito got the first shot, he wouldn’t get a second.
Interior walls stood at random in the first floor: the remains of offices, part of the hall. As perfect an ambush scenario as the ones built for agent training at Quantico. But no one died in those. And the hostage at the end of the course wasn’t real.
Brady ahead of her, bent-kneed, springy, prowling. An ethical tiger. Was his heart racing? She couldn’t tell by looking. He couldn’t see hers, either. Unless she told him, he couldn’t know if she was afraid. She moved up to cover his left side.
Paint silhouettes showed where cupboards and fittings had been pulled out. leaving ghosts behind like Hiroshima’s shadowed dead. Demolition rubble lay in drifts. Sawdust and gypsum powdered every flat surface. She worked her way over the irregular flooring—old wide-board pine, newer plywood underlayment, bits of industrial carpet.
The elevator doors were boarded over. Beside them the stairwell to the basement gaped, its fire door missing. The dust on the top step showed shoe prints. Sneakers, the same pattern over and over in both directions.
Brady saw them, too, pointed with his chin. She nodded. He started down the stairs, hugging the wall, and she followed.
The stairs were quiet. How much did a New York taxi medallion cost? Maybe they were going to wake some poor bastard who had just finished a late shift in an illegal cab, and Reyes would be pissed.
No. The cab was a murdermobile. They’d followed a good trail. Saito was at the end of it.
And someday someone was going to die who would’ve lived if they’d shown up two minutes earlier. Not today. Not here.
She grew calmer with each step. She thought, Be vewy quiet. We’re hunting wabbits. It was the secret mantra she couldn’t tell Brady, because he would think she wasn’t taking this seriously. But she was taking it extremely seriously: In the cartoon, the wabbit always won.
They took position on either side of the wooden door at the bottom of the stairs, backs to the wall. Brady was on the knob side. He reached one-handed, turned it, but the door didn’t open. He looked across to Lau and asked the question with his eyebrows. She nodded.
In one smooth motion, Brady stepped in front of the door and kicked. Splinters flipped across the room from the broken frame.
Movement. They leveled their weapons—not fast enough for the gray cat that bolted off the cot and behind a workbench. Lau’s lungs and heart pumped in a frenzy.
Saito’s room was about thirty feet wide and twenty feet long, lit by fluorescent tubes on the ceiling. Half was living space: a cot with a sleeping bag against one wall, a microwave and an electric grill on a table over a mini fridge, a TV, a laptop computer, a rolling clothes rack with dark men’s clothes carefully grouped so shirts and trousers and jackets hung together.
The other side of the room was a hobbyist’s workshop: two big tables, racks of hand tools, lumber and pipes and electrical wire, everything needed to work with wood or metal or electricity. Innocent things, in innocent hands.
By the door stood a black leather carryon bag and a hardshell guitar case labeled “Tony D’Angelo, Fingers of Fury.”
The near walls were brick, covered with fading yellow paint. The far wall was new dark wood paneling. An open door near the outside wall revealed a long, narrow washroom.
Again they flanked the door. Brady slipped the long-handled mirror out of his breast pocket, extended it with a snap of one hand, and poked it into the room. He looked across at Lau and shook his head. She went in crouched and ready, anyway.
Two of the washroom walls were brick. The third was new wood paneling. The new wall had no doors. An empty unpainted pine shelf unit stood against it, close to the middle.
Lau concentrated on breathing deep and slow. Maybe it’s nothing. If it’s what it looks like, maybe no one’s inside. She hated the rest of the logical thought: Maybe no one inside is alive.
Brady crossed the room. Lau nodded, covered him with her weapon. He tugged on the shelf.
It swung out silently.
She smelled sweat and urine. She saw thick blue insulating foam on the inside of the shelf and on the walls of the inner room. She saw Tony D’Angelo strapped in a home-made padded chair with a high back, like a replica of an electric chair. Instead of leather bonds, silk straps crossed his chest, arms, legs, and forehead, holding him still. A gag in his mouth kept him quiet.
The man standing over D’Angelo had to be Jason Saito. His baggy clothes and taut features said he might be a gamma. For an instant, Lau thought Saito was holding up a viewing device like a stereoscope or a kinetoscope for D’Angelo. Brackets extended from the chair past either side of D’Angelo’s head, and the device rested across them.
The device was a piece of wood with two long spikes extending from it, a finger’s length apart. Saito’s hands lay on it. A shift in his balance would push the spikes into D’Angelo’s eyes.
Brady shouted, “FBI! Back away from him!”
D’Angelo whimpered through his gag. Saito glanced at Lau and Brady, frowned, then shook his head, “Do one damn thing, I fall forward, and Tony-o dies. Want to see?” He moved the spikes closer to D’Angelo’s eyes.
Brady said, “Stop. It’s over.”
“Guess so.” Saito twitched the spikes forward half an inch.
“No!” Lau yelled. Saito needed an excuse to prolong this. But she couldn’t think of one to give him.
“Oh, pretty,” Saito breathed, looking Lau up and down. “Bet I could make you cry, pretty girl.”
She studied Saito past her front sight and realized if it weren’t for D’Angelo, she’d laugh. All her fear was for the man in the chair.
Brady said, “Where’s the fear if you kill him, Jason?”
Saito said cooly, “In you.”
“Sure. The more witnesses, the merrier, huh?”
Saito squinted at Brady, then nodded. “Get me Fox News. Get some snipers, too. See if I fall backward or if—” Saito smiled. “—it’s bye-bye, Tony-o.” His tongue worked a little between his lips. It looked unconscious. She could hear D’Angelo panting through his nose.
Brady lowered his weapon. That was all right; Lau had the shot if it came to it. “When did you figure out it was the fear that got you off, Jason?” Brady asked. “It does, right? It’s not what you do to them. It’s what they do to you.”
Saito’s hands lay across the spiked board, but his eyes were on Brady.
Brady continued, “What the hell are you supposed to do, when they make you feel that way? Just dressing in black, standing a little too close on the subway—that’s all it takes to get ’em going. Then what do they expect you to do?”
“Yeah, Mr. FBI. Like you’ve been there.” But Saito doubted.
“My name’s Brady. But Mr. FBI works, too. How do you do it, Jason? You know what scares ’em. How?”
Saito smiled. “I read minds.”
“Then you know about Dallas.”
Saito looked from D’Angelo to Brady, brows drawn down over his nose. Lau just managed not to do something similar. What about Dallas?
“I know what I need to know,” Saito said. Not quite as cocky now.
Brady nodded. “Figured that. Were you going to rape Amanda Jones, only you found drowning scared her more? Was that when you knew you were different?”
“What do you know about it?”
“But you raped Rodney Johnson. Why? You don’t like men, so I’m guessing his fear—”
“What about Dallas?”
“We want to know all about it, man. You’re special. Could you tell you had a good one, as soon as they got in the cab? Or even before—don’t want to waste your time picking up a lame one.”
“Tell me about Dallas!” Saito nearly screamed it. “Tell me about Dallas, or I kill Tony-o.” D’Angelo whined in terror through the gag.
“Nah. Then my partner goes John Woo on your ass, and where’s the fun? Let’s make a deal.”
“No way, Mr. FBI.”
Brady shifted his pistol to his left hand and held it toward Lau.
She kept her isosceles stance and shook her head.
He shrugged and tucked it in her jacket pocket. She thought, Brady, this better not be some kind of cowboy scheme. But a cowboy scheme would be shooting Saito and taking the chance that D’Angelo might live. That’s what she should do. Reyes would understand. Reyes would expect it.
But Brady knew that.
Saito said, “What are you doing, Mr. FBI?”
Lau said, “Brady. We can wait for backup.”
“Jason can’t wait. He’s hot. He needs his fix.” Brady took a step toward Saito. “Everyone’s got a thing. I get that. Come on, let’s deal. Dallas is tasty. And it’s not a what-if, Jason. It’s real life.”
“You’re crazy, man.”
“Going on seven years now. If you really don’t care, my partner might as well drop you. Your call.”
Saito bit his lower lip, then said, “I can spot a lie.”
“Yeah? Say I’m lying, and I’ll know you’re bullshitting.”
Saito’s gaze flicked around the room. Lau wondered if she should pray Chaz, Todd, and Zhiang came quickly or gave them more time. What would Reyes do? Her pistol weighed heavier with every moment. Would D’Angelo’s death be too much to pay for getting Saito off the planet?
Yes. It was harder to be the good guys.
“Back off, let D’Angelo go. You come with us,” Brady said. “Comfortable room, plenty of exercise, good food, cable TV.”
“HBO?”
Brady whuffed, bitter amusement. “Give up, and I give you Dallas.”
“How do I know it’s worth it?”
Brady took another step toward Saito. Lau couldn’t see his face. She’d never heard the note that was in his voice when he said, “Oh, I bet you can tell.”
Saito’s mouth worked; his chest rose and fell. “Once isn’t enough. That place? You come visit me. Once a week.”
“Once a month.”
“No!”
“You want to wear out the batteries? It’s called desensitization. You don’t want that.”
Stall him, Brady. Any minute, through that door... Though she was damned if she knew how that would help.
“You promise?”
Lau watched Brady’s back muscles stretch with a breath. “I promise.”
Saito said, “Put out your hand.”
Gamma, gamma, gamma. Anything could happen. “No!” she cried. “Danny—”
Brady said, “Jason and I, we’ve got an understanding.” He stretched out his arm.
Saito clutched the board that threatened D’Angelo with one hand. He reached out the other and touched Brady’s fingers.
Saito’s indrawn breath scraped audibly in his throat. His eyes squeezed shut. Then he smiled. “Oh, yeah.” Slowly he stepped back from D’Angelo, pulling the board off the brackets. D’Angelo sagged in his bonds.
“Put it on the ground, and kick it into the corner,” Lau ordered him.
He did, without once taking his eyes off Brady. He was still smiling.
Lau thought, What the hell did I just see?
Saito turned his horrible smile on her. “Some thoughts I can hear without touching. He’ll die before he tells you.”
Act V
J. Edgar Hoover Building, Washington, D. C., 2:55 PM
From the door of her office, Falkner watched Brady stalk through the bullpen and drop his go bag on his desk. He never slouched; if there was one thing an officer left the army with, it was posture. But the elastic confident body language she’d thought was hardwired in Brady wasn’t there. He’ll walk like that when he’s fifty, she thought.
He’d done something so crazy it was worthy of Chaz, and gotten away with it. He’d get a dressing-down, of course, but he’d have known that going in. He must have thought it was the right thing to do, because he’d done it.
So why was he wary?
Reyes intercepted him as he turned toward the kitchenette. “You don’t have to tell me what you were thinking, because I do not care. Never pull a stupid fucking stunt like that again.” Which, Falkner thought, might be the first time she had heard Reyes drop the F-bomb.
Brady said, “Eddie Cieslewicz cut off his hand.”
“You thought Saito might have a little conscience?”
Brady shook his head. “No.”
“Then?”
“I’ll start my report.”
“Brady—”
“Or could be it’s time I quit.”
Reyes exhaled. It was like two samurai, Falkner thought, each waiting for the other’s move. “Write fast.”

6:35 PM
Falkner set Brady’s report down. It’s got the who, what, when, and where. Does he think we’ll fill in the why? She rubbed her burning eyes. Then she put on her jacket, picked up her briefcase, turned off her office light, and stepped outside.
Brady leaned against the wall, arms folded across his chest, head down, eyes closed. He wouldn’t have slept since—when? If he’d been lying down, she could have put his jacket over him, turned out the hall lights, and told the cleaning crew not to disturb him.
He said, “Just resting my eyes,” and straightened up. “You read it?”
She thought, Like you believed I might not have. “Yes.”
“Is it a good enough answer for Reyes?”
“Depends. Do you want to see Saito once a month?”
“No, ma’am. But I gave him my word.”
“Then you might have a problem.”
“He’ll want to know what Saito’s getting.”
Thinking, We all will, she nodded. “Secrets are things the other guy can use. It’s like those British espionage scandals.” She considered her options. “And ’Don’t ask, don’t tell.’”
Brady glanced at her. “You know I’m gay.”
“You know I’m a profiler.”
He smiled slightly, just the tiniest quirk at the corner of his lips. “Yes, ma’am.”
“It’s not about you being gay.” When he frowned, she added, “Is it?”
“It’s about Andre Kent.”
She realized he wasn’t the only one who was tired. The name sounded familiar, and it was a name Brady knew, so it had something to do with— “Your friend. And your first contact—”

Dallas, TX, February 22, 2001
He burst into a bedroom he knew better than his own and that he did not know at all: A silver plastic tarp covered the mattress. Andre, in workout pants and a T-shirt printed with Elvis Presley’s face and the words, “LET ME BE YOUR TEDDY BEAR,” leaned over a tanned young man in jeans. The man, naked from the waist up, writhed on the tarp, spread-eagled, supine, tied to the bed posts and gagged with a bandanna that looked like the Texas flag.
Brady thought in relief, Andre’s fine. It’s some kind of game. It’s—
Andre was cutting the young man’s chest.
No. Andre was stroking his left index finger along the man’s chest. The skin was parting as if he held a knife.
Andre looked up, startled and embarrassed. “Danny. You said—” He looked back at the young man. “This isn’t what it looks like.”
The man raised his head, saw Brady, and gave a breathy, wordless screech through his gag.
“Andre—”
“I’ll fix it. See?” Andre smoothed his hand over the cut, and skin came together, leaving a pink line in the tan. The blood smeared on the man’s torso, on Andre’s fingertips. “It’s fine.”
“No.”
Andre nodded quickly. “You’re right. It’s—it’s not. This is Phil Tobin. You remember?”
Brady nodded. Tobin. Believed to have led a gay-bashing spree that ended with a sixteen-year-old boy dying of exposure in the woods. His mother hired the best lawyer in the city, and the jury agreed it was just a case of boys being boys.
Andre swept his hand again. Tobin’s chest parted from navel to sternum. Tobin arched, screamed past the gag. Andre glared down at him, and said in his passionate, courtroom voice, “See! That’s pain!”
Brady was aiming his Smith & Wesson at Andre. When had he drawn it? When had he dropped the grocery sack? He said, “Andre—”
Andre looked up. His eyes in candlelight were golden, but they were only brown now. His chin lifted. When he admitted he was at fault, he always did it looking his accuser in the eye. “You’re right, Danny. He’s scum. That doesn’t mean I should be. I believe in justice.” He passed his hand down Tobin’s torso again. Tobin sobbed, terror and relief mixed.
“It’s over now,” Andre said gently. Then he flicked his index finger across Tobin’s throat. Brady heard the bubbling breath as the neck opened, cut almost to the spine.
Andre’s face was a parody of mercy as he stroked his fingers back across Tobin’s neck. Tobin’s throat healed, but Tobin only twitched twice and lay still. His chest did not move.
Andre said, “Don’t look at me like that, Danny. Please. Everyone makes mistakes.”
Brady said, “Stay where you are.” He could barely speak above a whisper. Charlie Daniels might have drowned him out.
Andre stepped toward him, reaching out with his left hand, the hand that had cut Tobin. The blood on it was wet and bright as fresh paint. Maybe it was paint. Andre surprising Brady with a practical joke. The worst sort imaginable for a cop.
Andre hated practical jokes.
“It doesn’t mean a thing, Danny. It doesn’t change what we have.”
What he had with Andre. This was someone—something—else.
Maybe he felt the skin of his chest begin to part. Maybe he only imagined it. His Smith & Wesson fired. That’s what you do when threatened with deadly force. Don’t mess around with warning shots or wounding shots. Shoot for the heart.
Andre jerked slightly, then looked down, surprised. Blood spread onto his t-shirt from a small hole in his sternum. Blood was sprayed behind him on the tan carpet they’d picked out together six weeks ago and on the turquoise wall that was Brady’s favorite color.
Brady felt his skin prickling all over as if fireants were nibbling at him. Or that’s what he thought he had felt afterward.
A bleeding hole appeared above Andre’s golden-brown eyes. Blood spattered the painting Brady had given Andre for his birthday: two stylized horses, one red, one white, ran through the greens and grays and golds of the Texas plains under a fragile blue sky.
The prickling became burning. Andre stepped again, reaching toward Brady with his left arm, lips twitching.
Heart shot doesn’t stop him. Head shot doesn’t. What will?
The third shot went through Andre’s left shoulder. That arm fell limp, but the right rose, then fell with the sound of a fourth shot.
Brady stepped back, pistol still before him in both hands. Andre lurched closer, or maybe he was falling, but what should you do when something impossible is coming for you, maybe to kill you, maybe to hold you while it died?
The fifth shot went through Andre’s right knee. Air passed from his lungs, or maybe he said “Danny.” He fell sideways, convulsing as if electrocuted.
Brady fired again and again. He didn’t know he was counting bullets until he came to the last and thought, I could save that one for me.
He fired it into Andre’s heart, and everything he loved was finally dead.
He dropped the magazine from his pistol, yanked out the spare, slammed it home, and aimed downward. Andre lay still. Blood pooled out from his body. Five quarts in a human being. How many quarts of blood in someone you love? Nine? Ten? The carpet wicked it toward him. It was almost under the pointed toes of his boots before he stepped back.

J. Edgar Hoover Building, Washington, D. C., July 18, 2007
Brady looked away, into the half-lit bullpen. For an instant, Falkner wondered if that was as much as he could bring himself to say. But he shook his head and turned back. “I said friend when I wrote it up. It wasn’t a lie. Just wasn’t the truth.”
Falkner stood beside him, remembering one of Todd’s mantras. Breathe in, breathe out, move on. You had to remember to take the time to breathe before you moved.
Brady added, “Still can’t figure what triggered Andre. He’d lost a little weight— But he was always trying to lose a little. I tell myself it was a case he lost around then, but—”
“You can’t know.”
“I tell myself that, too.”
She nodded. “You’ll share that with Saito?”
He shrugged. “Already did.”
“You’ll keep sharing it with Saito?”
“I said I’d go to Arkham every month. So every month, I will. But he may not like it.” Brady closed his mouth tight, as if keeping back some strong emotion, but she couldn’t tell which one. “I think I just killed the taste of it for him.”
“Because you told it to me.”
Brady nodded.
“And you’ll tell the others?”
“Yeah.” He didn’t slouch, but he had a way of setting his shoulders that said, Done now.
“Brady?”
He turned his head, and she thought, Convictions, principles, drive. A yearning toward justice. A determination to be of use. Where would he be if Andre hadn’t gone gamma? She said, “Buy you a beer?”
“I’ll be fine.”
“I know that.”
“And you don’t get enough time with your family.”
She set her hand on Brady’s arm, as lightly and as firmly as she would have set it on the arm of anyone she loved. “That’s why I’m offering.”

Sweetheart

Dallas, TX, January 2001
That Tuesday, Brady didn’t get off work until almost eight. When he let himself into Andre’s condo, he found it full of the scent of minestrone. From the living room speakers, They Might Be Giants murmured something about thinking and not thinking.
As he closed and locked the door behind him, Andre emerged from the kitchen, barefoot, wearing his ratty jeans and with his dress shirt untucked.
“Have I ever told you how much you look like Steve Dallas when you do that?”
Andre raised his eyebrows. “Is that a complaint or a new kink I should know about? Also, what happened to, ’hi, sweetheart, how was your day?’”
Brady hadn’t smiled since sometime around ten o’clock that morning, and god, it felt like his face cracking apart. “Andre, what would you do to me if I called you ’sweetheart’?”
“Feed you your nuts with a club soda chaser,” Andre said without missing a beat.
“And that would be what happened to ’hi, sweetheart, how was your day.’”
Andre’s eyes softened as he let the banter die. “Bad one?”
“Yeah,” Brady said, as lightly as he could. He didn’t want to dwell on what it was like to start the day with two bodies in a basement apartment, killed with a shotgun, and spend the rest of it traveling backward through their lives: despair, poverty, diagnosed inoperable tumor, fights, behavior changes, nine happily married years, met on a blind date. Rewind from ruin to happiness to be able to say, yes, it was definitely murder/suicide. Cause of death: failure to cope. So he just said, “Pretty bad.”
“Well, you lose the hardware, and I’ll pour you something alcoholic, and we can...” He considered Brady thoughtfully. “We can talk about something completely different until you stop trying to crack your molars there, cowboy.”
“Shit,” Brady said.
“Busted,” Andre said. “Hurry up, I want to get you drunk.” He went back into the kitchen and Brady proceeded down the hall to lock the Smith & Wesson in its gunsafe-away-from-home.

The Sociopath in the Street

Johns Hopkins Medical Center, Baltimore, MD, April, 2005
The room was cold as a skating rink, and smelled faintly of alcohol and corruption. Sounds like the title of a Tennessee Williams play, Daniel Brady thought. Or the plot summary, anyway.
Madeline Frost was doing something to something on the examining table, with what looked like bolt cutters. Her latex-gloved hands seemed too small and soft and plump to squeeze the handles, but intermittent cracking sounds suggested otherwise. The gray in Frost’s razored pixie cut showed fluorescent-white in the hard, clear lights.
Brady had as strong a stomach as any, and stronger than most, but he didn’t angle for a better view of the table. “Hey, Frost, if you were going to murder active, white, middle-class men between the ages of 20 and 35, how would—”
“Why would I do that?” Frost didn’t turn from her work.
“Well, you wouldn’t, obviously, but if you did—”
“But I don’t.”
Brady sighed. “Bear with me here for a moment, would you? I need the opinion of the Sociopath in the Street.”
She turned at last and stared into his face, as if wondering how hard it would be to remove it intact. Then she nodded. “Okay. Shoot.”
