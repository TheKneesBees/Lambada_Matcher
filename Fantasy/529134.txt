Chapter One

     Pete arrived at the Laveau house, ready to see his daughter again after sorting out the morbid details for his sister’s funeral. He had decided that he would only have a few attendees since there was no family from his side and they didn’t have many friends. This is why he didn’t want Ellie to be with him. He didn’t want her to worry like she did last time. He had tried to protect her in any way he could, but this was something he could not shield her from. Pete pulled up in the driveway and powered down the engine. He paused at the wheel, willing himself to move from the seat but he just sat there and deeply sighed.
     “Come on, Pete. You need to do this.” He said to himself.     
      Pete pushed open the door and locked the car with one press of his keys. He stood outside looking up at his home, wishing for everything to go back to how it was. His hand trembled on the door handle. Pete clenched his fist to try and get rid of the nerves. He tried again. He had to be strong for Ellie and show that he could bear the weight of it all, to show her that there was nothing to worry about. He hadn’t been sleeping well at night and it showed on his face. He was ready to paint the fake smile on again. He opened the front door to expect Ellie to run up to him and hug him tightly as she used to do, but as the door slammed shut there was nothing. 
     “Ellie, I’m home!” Pete called out.
     He waited in the hall for an answer. “Ellie?” he called out again.
    Something wasn’t right. Pete walked into the living room to see that the TV was still on. The television played an afternoon talk show that he had no interest in. He walked through the living room and into the kitchen. All was left was an empty plate sitting in the sink. 
     “Ellie, Ellie?” His voice started to creep with panic. 
     He picked up his pace and headed up the stairs and into Ellie’s bedroom. Pete held onto the door handle as he felt his heart drop. Some of Ellie’s draws had been opened. There were clothes scattered on the floor and a few missing items from their rightful places. 
     “Ellie!?” fear had gripped him and it wasn’t letting go.
     Pete quickly ran down the stairs. His mind raced with horrible thoughts that he didn’t want to entertain. There, sitting on the sofa was Ellie’s phone. He snatched at it and searched through, thinking it could answer all of his questions. There were old text messages wishing Ellie to get better and a few asking what were her plans. Then the voice of reason appeared to give Pete some comfort.
     “God I hope she’s in school.” He prayed. “But why take her clothes?” another voice popped into his head making him feel worse.
     Pete picked one of the girls number from the phone and decided to ring it. He picked Lilly’s and the phone started to ring. After four rings a whisper answered the phone.
     “Ellie? Is everything ok?” Lilly whispered on the phone. 
     Just hearing Lilly thinking it was Ellie filled him with dread.
     “Uh, no it’s her Dad.” Pete had to resist the urge to start panicking. “Lilly, is Ellie there at school with you?” He held his breath.
     There was silence on the other end.
     “No, she’s not.” His world collapsed.
     He ended the call without saying his goodbyes, and the phone fell from of his grief stricken hands.


Chapter Two

     Voices filled my ears. Someone was talking over me. Their stale breath filtered into my nose. There was more than one person, and they were all talking at once, but I couldn’t make out what they were saying. I think they were arguing amongst themselves.
     I couldn’t move. My limbs were lifeless, and I was at their mercy. I wanted to get up, to run away, but my body felt heavy and light at the same time. My head pounded in sync with my own heat-beat and I felt like at any minute, I would float away and be rid of all this. Away from whatever had me in its grasp.
     “Stick her downstairs, and keep an eye on her!” One of the voices shouted.
     Where? Where am I going? Panic flooded in and I tried to keep calm. I was picked up and man-handled as they dragged me away. Then the smell hit me like ton of bricks. I was reminded of the deepest horrors I would rather try and keep locked away. The leaches dragged me away while their talon nails dug into my arms. I wanted to scream, flail my arms around, but my entire body was paralyzed, I was useless. 
   My poor vision failed e as I tried to make out my surroundings. Dark bloodied stone pass me by, as I was carried down to whatever hell they had in store for me. A creaking noise echoed throughout and I was thrown up against something solid and pain spiked up and down my back. I screamed out in joy, I could still feel pain. That was a good thing; I wasn’t dead, not yet.  
     Something cold made its way around my weak wrists and again I heard the creaking noise. Then there was silence, no voices, nothing. I tried to get to my feet but something pulled me back, slamming my body back into the wall. I then realized that I was chained up like a filthy animal. I try to scream, but every time I did my throat would seize up. Again I try to struggle against the clanging metal, but the chains that bind me were strong. 
     Finally my eyes adjust to the darkness and they revealed a small dark cell without any windows. The walls were gripped with mould and dirt. It traveled along the dark stone and up to the ceiling. It was disgusting, and I was living in it. At the front of the cell stood a large rusted metal door with a tiny spy hatch attached. They just want to see me suffer. 
     I slump to the floor in defeat. I wish Rhea was here. Then my mind exploded with memories, it all came flooding back to me. The house, the monsters, and what had happened to Rhea and Sophia. I hope they made it out ok. It was my entire fault, I wish I never had these stupid powers, and then everything would be ok. I wouldn’t be chased by monsters and turning people into crazed animals. I was a danger to myself and others around me. Remembering what happened also brought back the pain. My body burned with the bite marks that the leaches left. I tried to ignore the pain as best as I could but tears trickled down my cheeks and fell onto the black stone floor. Without thinking I tried to wipe them away but the chain would clang and the cold metal bit into my wrist. 
     More tears fell down my face. I wanted to be strong; I didn’t want to give them the satisfaction of seeing me crying on the floor. Then my heart started to pound inside my chest. Outside my cell there were muffled footsteps. With each step they became louder and clearer. Then there was silence. I held my breath as I could hear the bolts of the old door move into place. My heart thumped rapidly inside my chest as the rusted door opened, filling the room with a familiar stench. I gagged on the powerful aroma as the creature stalked into my small cell. Seeing the leach again was still frightening as it was the first time. He sniffed the air around him and his inhuman face landed in my direction and smiled a sharp grin. 
     It slowly slunk towards me with it sick twisted smile on its filthy scabby black lips. I tried not to scream as the disgusting monster was just inches away from my face. Then a thought came, it was a stupid one but I had to try. I quickly got up on my feet and brought out my leg and tried to kick at the monster. The leach quickly caught my leg and dug its nails deep into my calf. My leg stung with pain as I tried to wrestle it out of its filthy grip. Finally he released, and I fell to the floor trying to clutch at my wounded leg. The hideous monster just stared down at me licking its lips.
     “What do you want?” I tried to ask
     It didn’t answer, I don’t even know if they could talk. Then while I felt sorry for myself he pulled out a syringe filled with the same black substance I remembered at the manor. My eyes shot open as he started to play around with it between his claws. I backed up from him but it was no use. He came closer to me and I tried to scream. He stuck the syringe into my neck and the room began to spin and sway. That same feeling of weightlessness washed over me. I tried to fight against the sedative but it was no use, I was losing the battle. I sat there, slumped on the floor as I watched the leach walk away.
     While I was in and out of consciousness, moaning groans and terrifying screams pierced my ears. More shrill screams carried throughout the cells, and I just wanted to curl up in a corner and close my eyes tight. I just wanted to shut it all out for good.   
     I woke up with my face on the floor. My entire body felt weak and there was a tingling sensation running through my battered body. I tried to lift my head up but I felt like it was filled with bricks. I just laid on the floor, staring at the door hoping for it all to stop, hoping for it all to end. 
     Hours or even days passed without anyone disturbing my numb sleep. I could still feel the black fluid flowing throughout my body. It made every nerve inside feel fluffy and numb at the same time. Deep down I never wanted the feeling to stop and that scared me more than anything. It prevented me from thinking straight and that’s what they wanted from me, numb and lifeless.  
     Then I was awoken from my sleep by more footsteps on the cold ground. The chains rattled as I tried to stand but my balance failed me and I fell back down onto my knees. The affects of the drug were still in my system. The door was pulled open and stale air filled up my still breathing lungs. 
     “Please, no more injections.” My weak mind thought.
     In walked a human man who looked oddly familiar. He came closer to my face and he smelled fresh, something I hadn’t smelt in a while. This was no leach. The mysterious stranger came closer into my cell carrying something with both hands.
     “You hungry?” the voice asked. The oddly familiar man carried a metal tray, with what looked like sludge along with a half a cup of water.
     His voice, I’ve heard it before. I couldn’t be sure since my mind was in fragments, but inside my mind I knew that voice. Then he came closer and I saw his deep blue sea eyes penetrating through the darkness. I stared into them and I could feel myself being drawn in. I pulled away as everything came into place. I tried to speak but my throat was too dry.
     My mind burst with questions and I needed answers, but as soon as I could form a sentence inside my mind it would float away from my grasp.
     Dr. Moss placed the plastic cup to my lips and I eagerly drank from it. The water was a bit warm and stale but I welcomed anything at that moment. Then he quickly snatched it away before I could quench my thirst.
     “No all at once.” He said.
     “Are you going to free me?” My throat burned while I tried to talk.
     Dr. Moss didn’t answer.
     “Please.” I begged.
     “Ellie, I’m not here to help you.” He placed the cup back into my mouth. “I’m with them now.”
     As he spoke the words my heart dropped. There was no rescue for me.
     I finished what was inside the cup while staring into those deep eyes of his.  
     “Why!” I wanted it to come out as a scream but a mere whisper escaped.
     “It’s complicated. I don’t want to be here.” He said “but I cannot free you, I’m sorry.”
     “My neck.” I turned my heavy head and showed him the many track marks from the needle.
     He looked disgusted by it but did not offer any words.
     “What do they want from me?” I asked.
     Dr Moss didn’t answer he just placed down the metal tray covered with slop. I looked down at the unappealing so-called food and kicked the tray away, splattering it up against the wall.
     “You will need you strength for what is to come and maybe the next person who comes in won’t be so sympathetic.” He left the tray and exited the cell leaving me in darkness again.
     I wanted to scream till my lungs burst, but my throat brought me nothing but pain. I wanted to scream at Dr. Moss for letting them do this to me. How could he just sit back and let them drug me, and he was so nice at the hospital. Lies, it was all just lies. Something nagged at me about what he said. I would need all my strength? I will never help them in any way; I’d rather stay here and starve. 
     Just thinking about food made me hungry, but there’s no way I’m eating that slop. The food that spilt onto the walls had already started to form a hard crust around it. Finally admitting defeat for now, I tried to find a comfortable position. I then waited.
     More screams and curdle cry’s of pain filled my ears. Were they torturing people down here? I hope I’m not next on their list, I had no information to give them. The screams got louder and more terrifying, I just wanted them to stop. As I tried to think clearly, my thoughts would disappear from my grasp or I would forget simple words to hold a sentence together. Soon the numb wave was back and I could feel myself slipping away back into the darkness where it scared me the most. 
     Pain dragged me back into the harsh reality. My wrists were now covered in specks of dried blood. The metal shackles were cutting into my flesh. I looked carefully at the cuffs around my wrists, the pain was growing and I needed to get them off. I looked them over but there was no key hole or a way to undo them. I tried to pull them off or to loosen, but they brought me more pain. I wanted to scream with frustration, but I couldn’t. I needed to get out of this place before I go mad. I was so busy with my wrists that I didn’t notice that there was someone looking down at me. I peered up and two leaches stood over me with their sick twisted smile. 
     I tried to back away from them but there was nowhere to go. The leaches easily unlocked my chains and forced me onto my feet. For the first time I could feel a tiny bit of relief. I looked down at my wrists; there were deep slashes across them. I tore my eyes away from them only to be ushered out of my cell.         
     “Where are you taking me?” I asked with my frail voice.
     They didn’t answer; they just pushed me forward and out of the cell. The room beyond my cell looked familiar. The same stains stuck to the floor, along with pools of blood dotted around the many cells entrances. Each room was numbered, I looked back at my so-called room, and I was number six. As I walked past the many doors I could hear screams and whimpering coming from the rusted out-doors. I held onto myself as the leaches behind me snarled and prodded me. My body was weak, but I didn’t want to fall in front of these creatures, they would only enjoy seeing me suffer.
     We came to a set of stairs that led up and out of the dungeons. Carefully, I took each step at a time. I tried to catch my breath when I finally reached the top.
     “Where are you taking me?” I asked again.
     They just snarled and pushed me forward.
      We walked down a darkened stone floor corridor and along the walls were scratches and specks of blood. The three of us walked through a badly battered door and one of the leaches pulled me to a stop. I stood there waiting in a dimly lit area covered with dirty stone walls. I stood there shivering from the bitter cold. I was still dressed in my jeans and top but they were in shreds. The leaches stood beside me as if they were waiting for something. Around me gas lamps burst into flame and colour filled my vision.  
     At one of the side doors, out came a tall and well built man, and accompany him was Dr. Moss. They strode over towards a throne-like chair that was the focus of the entire room. The well built man took his seat while smiling gleefully at me. The doctor stood at his side with his head down at the floor.











Chapter Three

     “It’s finally nice to see you awake, Siren” The man’s voice carried throughout the stone filled walls.
     “Dr. Moss.” I tried to get his attention but the doctor didn’t answer. He remained with his head bowed to the floor.
     The well built man looked at the doctor and laughed. “He cannot help you, you are mine now.”
     “I’m no ones.” I said weakly.
     The man roared laughing in his chair. He sat forward in his seat as if he and I were the only ones in the room. “You are mine until I am done with you, little Siren!” He almost spat the words out.
     The gas lamps lit up all his features on his scared covered face. He had long black hair that stuck to his sweaty face and deep pink scars under both eyes. His nose was straight but curved at the tip. He might have been good looking once, but time was no friend to him.
     Around me the leaches closed in. They all bowed their heads and I was stuck in the middle along with the other two standing beside me. I was slowly getting scared by the second, was this it? Would I die here? 
     “What do you want?” I asked him.
     “Well I want your power, that’s all.” He said “you can join us if you wish?”
     “I will never help you. Just kill me now and get it over with!” I tried to shout.
     “No, no, my dear, you are far too valuable to kill. Maybe a few more days in the cell will change your mind?” 
     “No, please!” I cried out. I didn’t want to go back down there. I had to get out of here. I closed my eyes and tried to find any ounce of energy I had left. I opened my mouth and tried to scream with all the energy I had. My throat closed up and my head began to swim. I suddenly lost my balance and fell to the floor. My mind began to spin and all the colours began to merge into one. Around me laughter and snarls filled the room. 
     “That stuff we’ve been injecting into you. It’s to stop your abilities; you are powerless against us all.” Again he erupted into laughter “and it’s all thanks to the wonderful doc’ here. He’s quite the genius when it comes to chemicals.” 
     His words ran straight through me like shards of glass. I was powerless and alone. I clenched my hands into fists.  
     I looked up to Dr. Moss with anger and he still had his head down, he wouldn’t meet my gaze.
     “Someone get her up, it’s a bit depressing.” said the man sitting in the throne-like chair.
     The leaches beside me grabbed onto my arms and pulled me up onto my feet. I pulled back and thrust my fist across one of the leach’s face and hit it hard. Pain shot though my hand and I clenched it against my chest. There was silence, no one spoke. The bruised leach looked towards his master for his approval and he replied with a nod. The creature brought the back of his hand against my face and sharp pain cut against my skin. I stood my ground. Blood trickled down my cheek, he had nicked my skin.
     Then the leaches sniffed the air around them. They could smell the scent of my blood; they closed in around me like a pack of hungry hyenas. They outstretched their claws, ready to strike. I slowly backed away from them. A stinging pain quickly traveled up my arm, as one of the leaches beside me had slashed at my skin. I winced out in pain as it licked the tiny amounts of blood from its talon claws. It smiled as it tasted my life-force, and then he wanted more.
     Faster they approached, they each wanted a taste.
     “No, not again. Please, no. Stay away” I screamed inside.
     “Enough!” a voice shouted. The leaches stood still and dispersed leaving me clutching at my fresh wound.
    “Take the siren back to her cell, and give her something for the pain.” He told the doctor.
     Dr. Moss weaved around the leaches and slowly picked me up off the floor. Touching his hand felt weird. I expected for him to turn into the animal I’ve come to expect from others, but my powers were truly gone and for once in my life I really needed them.
     
     The doctor ushered me down the stairs and back into the pits of the dungeons. I tried to fight against his grip but it was too strong.
     “Don’t struggle.” He gruffly said.
     “So you’re with them now are you?” I asked.
     He remained quiet on the subject.
     “Answer me!” I yelled and a sharp pain made its way to my throat.
     “I don’t have to tell you anything, just shut up and do as your told.” He replied.
     As we moved towards my cell, panic began to slowly creep in. I didn’t want to be shackled up again. I tried to pull away from him once I saw the chains swinging from the wall.
     “Please don’t do this!” I tried to say.
     “Do you think I want to do this?!” he replied quickly. 
     “Then don’t, you have a choice.”
     “No, I don’t.” he said.
 The doctor replaced the cuffs back on without saying anymore. Fresh pain traveled throughout my wrists and I wanted to cry, but not in front of him. The blue eyed doctor pulled out his black concoction and slowly brought the needle towards my neck. The fear inside me seized up all of my muscles and I just wanted to scream. It then burrowed into my neck and I could feel the liquid flowing throughout my body. Fear and pain was replaced by a soft darkness, and I gladly let it take over.
     I awoke to the sounds of ringing in my ears. Slowly it tried to drill its way into my brain. I gritted my teeth and tried to deal with the pounding pain. The tingling sensation was back and this time it was making my arms and legs feel heaver then they actually were. Sitting on the ground was another metal tray of the same goop that decorated the wall. Deep down I wanted to devour it in one sitting, but it didn’t look or smell edible. I ignored it, I can still hold out a little more. But those words were a lie. I would surely die down here. More ringing shot though my head and I had to fight the urge to scream.  
     Tears flowed down my face, how many had I shed while being here? I couldn’t even wipe them away, I was a total mess. Shuffling footsteps stopped my train of thought. I didn’t care anymore what they stuck into me or their failed attempts of trying to intimidate me. The rusted-out door came alive with a sharp moan and I welcomed the fresh air. It was the blue eyed doctor again. He held a glass in his right hand and offered it to me. He placed it softy to my lips and I drank the cool refreshing liquid, trying carefully not to choke. The dryness inside my throat was washed away. I finished the glass and I just stared at him, how could someone so caring, be so cruel. What had I done to him? Did he know from the start what I was? My mind was too broken to finish any thoughts.
     “I wish I could help you Ellie, I do” he said softly.
     I just hung my head. I didn’t want to listen to him anymore. Unless the words are I’ll free you. I just didn’t want to know. 
     “I’m sorry Ellie but..” his words were cut short.
     The ground above us shook with force and chips of stone broke away from their foundation. The doctor looked around, his face startled. He rushed off locking the door behind him with a metallic clunk.
     “What’s going on?” I asked.
      I closed my eyes, more shakes came from above and this time there were loud shouts coming from outside of the cell. I stood there listening to the loud yells and explosions from afar. A bright light pierced its way through the peep hole. It was warm and inviting. It felt familiar. Slowly, I tried to get to my feet. The light was getting brighter and warming up my entire body. My cell door started to contort and peel away from its once strong hinges. It was thrown to the side like a crumpled piece of paper. The light engulfed my entire room leaving no shadows to dwell. I tried to shield my eyes from the radiance and prepared myself for the worst.
     “Ellie?” the seductive voice called.
     That voice. I lowered my hands and in the doorway was Rhea. My heart soared, I was saved. I walked forward only to be restricted by the wrist cutting chains. She stood in the doorway bathed in a glowing white light. She was truly a goddess and she was here to save me.  
     “Rhea?” I cried.
     “What have they done to you Ellie?” she said.
     Rhea walked into the room and with a wave of her wrist the metal shackles fell to the floor. I breathed a sigh of relief. I was free. Rhea placed her healing hands on me. Her ebbing light found its way into my body, and I could feel my skin knitting itself back together. Slowly, my strength came back, and the tingling sensation gone.
     “Ellie?” said a voice. I looked over Rhea’s shoulder and standing there with a gentle smile across her lips was Sophia. She walked into the bright cell and smiled a bright smile. I was so happy to see them that tears were obstructing my view.
     “Let’s go, we need to get back up top.” Rhea ordered.
     “Why can’t we just leave now?” I asked.
     “This stone is enchanted and prevents me from teleporting.”
     Rhea walked back through the door and left me and Sophia safely behind her. I was ready to say goodbye to this pit and I hoped I’d never see it again.
      Sophia helped me up the stairs, only now noticing that Rhea was leaving a trail of ash behind her. She must have killed a lot of leaches to get here and that made me smile. We reached the top of the stairs, but I had to stop for breath. I inhaled deeply but the air stung my lungs. I coughed and spluttered, while trying to find new breaths of air. I still hadn’t gotten my full strength back.
     “Ellie, we need to hurry my dear.” Just listening to Rhea’s her voice made me happy. I forgot how calming her voice had been.
     “Come on, we’re nearly there.” Sophia said with her elegant voice.
     I pushed on and we came into a main hall that I was taken to before. It was empty, except for the tiny drops of my blood speckled on the floor. Rhea grabbed onto my hand along with Sophia’s. But before we could escape a loud voice boomed throughout the hall.
     “Ah Rhea, I expected no less.” The brutish man said.
    “Barbus, I’d wished never to see you again.” Rhea spat.
      The shaggy haired man stared at me with hunger in his eyes. “If you think you’re taking my Siren you’re wrong.” he said.
     “You think she’s yours? She nobody’s toy!” Rhea shouted.
     “No I wouldn’t say that, but she does have her uses.” His lips turned into a sick smirk that made chills run down my spine.
     “You are sick.” said Rhea
     “Don’t be like that, remember the good times we had.” He replied.
     Around the man who called himself Barbus, gangs of leaches started to appear. I stood behind Rhea, hoping she would protect me.
     “They were never good times, Barbus. I’m a different person now.”
     “No one ever truly changes, but if it helps you sleep at night.” Barbus replied.
      “You disgust me, you did horrid things!” Rhea yelled
     “Don’t lie you enjoyed every bit-.” Before Barbus could finish he was blasted back through a door. That was the leaches cue to attack. They rushed at us screeching and gnashing their teeth. Sophia stepped forward and erected a barrier around us, turning the eager leaches into dust. From the back of the room blasts of red came flooding towards us. It struck the barrier, but it held its ground. Before Barbus could attack again, Rhea grabbed mine and Sophia’s arms and the world was torn away in a blink of an eye.










Chapter Four
     
The same feeling came over me again. I wanted to be sick, but I fought the urge. My stomach flipped and jumped as I traveled from one place to another. Finally I was dropped onto a hard floor and I rolled to a stop. Rhea stood over me while Sophia was just getting to her feet. She looked perfect, truly an angel.
     “Thank you Rhea, You saved me, I thought I would die down there.” I said with a weak voice.
     “I’m happy that you’re back too. That’s why I’m sorry to do this.” She said.
     Two strong men walked over to me and lifted me up on my feet. I tried to fight against them but they were like two brick walls. They dragged me away and put me in a small room. I was about to run back through the door but Rhea stood between me and freedom. She waved her hand and the door clamped shut, locking me in.
     “I’m sorry Ellie, but you need to stay here.” She said, her voice echoing through the door.
     “No, Rhea, please let me out!” I shouted. 
     “Listen, they have been injecting you with something that’s highly addictive and for your own benefit, it needs to leave your system.” Her voice was so calm and confident.
     “I trusted you Rhea!” I screamed. I repeatedly slammed my fists against the sturdy door. 
     “It’s just for a few days, I’m sorry.” Her footsteps echoed down the hall and I was all alone, again.
     When I finished slamming and pounding on the door, I gave up. I slumped down on the floor and curled up. 
     This cell was much nicer then my so-called other one. There was a small single bed in one corner and a toilet, and sink at the other side. 
     “Well at least it has pluming.”  I thought.
     The room had been painted with blinding white walls along with the pristine while floor, it felt like being in a padded cell.
      How could Rhea do this to me, first she rescues me and now she leaves me? I felt awful, my wrists were healed and the marks on my neck too, but, I felt itchy and irritable. I just wanted get up and leave but there was no way. I picked myself up from the floor and helped myself to some water. The cups they had were made out of paper. (What am I a child?) The water was cool going down, and for just a second I forgot about the nagging itchy feeling. I closed my eyes and tried to focus my mind onto something else, other than the pain I was feeling. I threw myself onto the bed and it felt like heaven, I hadn’t felt something this soft in a long time. I pulled the blankets around me tight and tried to get some needed sleep.
     A loud noise woke me up. I shot up from the bed, fearing another leach would be accompanying me. When I remembered that I was safe, free from their clutches (well if anyone would call this free?). The door opened slowly and I waited for whatever was about to greet me. 
     Sophia thanked someone to her right and walked in. She smiled and placed down a tray that was supporting a sandwich. My eyes lit up and I snatched it from the plate. For such a basic sandwich it tasted amazing. 
     “Slow down or you’ll choke.” She said.
     I took her advice and took my time. Sophia stood over me and watched, as I tore the sandwich apart like a savage animal.
     “I’m sorry it took so long to find you, Ellie.” She said softly. 
     I stopped making a pig of myself and looked up to meet her gaze. Sophia was wearing one of her unusual outfits again. This time she wore frilly gloves that traveled up to her elbows, a tight fitting corset that pulled her in tightly attached to a ruffle skirt. Where did she get her clothes from? 
     “What do you mean? I was only gone a few days wasn’t I?” I asked.
     Sophia didn’t answer. She remained quiet.
     “Sophia, tell me? How long was I gone for?” 
     “Two weeks.” Her words felt hollow and strange.
     I swallowed my final bite with a bit of difficulty. “What?!”  
     “Rhea did not stop until she found you. It took us awhile but-.” I cut her off.
     “I was gone for two weeks?! But it only felt like a few days at the most.” 
     “It’s because of the stuff they injected into you. You must have been asleep most of the time.” 
     The words passed though me as they meant nothing. Two weeks I was locked up, it didn’t even feel remotely close to that. I immediately grabbed at my neck. They had been drugging me, keeping me asleep and doped up. The words just spun around my head, until I felt sick.
     “Are you ok, Ellie?”
     “Yeah, fine.” I lied.
     I took a sip of water that sat on the tray.
     “When can I get out of here?” I asked her.
     “It’s not up to me Ellie.” she replied.
     “But why, can’t Rhea just heal me? Surely she can do that?” 
     “I asked her that and she cannot. Whatever is in your system cannot be cure by magical means.” She said “I’m sorry. You just have to wait it out.”
     “But I feel like I’m going crazy.” I said.
     “I’m sorry, Ellie.”  
     Sophia picked up the tray and the empty cup, as she was about to leave I snatched at her dress.
     “Please don’t leave.” I pleaded with her.
     “Ellie I wish I could stay but I have orders.” she pulled away from me and exited through the door that led to my only escape. 
     I crawled back into bed with a full stomach. It felt nice to have some decent food, not that disgusting thing on a plate they tried to feed me. Sophia said it would only be a few days, I could handle that, just a few more days and I could get the hell out of here.

     At night that was when the pain started. I began to sweat through my clothes. I began to feel clammy and irritable. My temperature was high then it would drop. It was like my body didn’t know how to regulate my temperature, I just wanted to scream. My body ached throughout. What did they put into my body? I splashed myself with some water and tried to calm myself down. Nothing worked. I scratched at my skin till it became sore. I pounded on the door till my hand hurt, but no one answered. I needed to get out. With my powers, I could bring this place down if I needed to, but I had to suppress it. Clenching my teeth together would take the pain away, but only for a few seconds and then it would start up again. I climbed into bed and wrapped myself up in the blanket, no matter how hot I was. I would beat this thing. Waves of heat came from within my own body and sweat trickled down my face. I brought my knees up towards my chest and sat there. After a while of trying to suppress the pain, sleep caught up to me. I tried to get myself into a comfy position and tried to get some rest. 
     
     I awoke to a piercing noise throughout the room. My eyes scanned each of the white walls to see that there were many slash marks made into the walls. My heart raced as I could smell the familiar stench that brought me back to those deep dungeons. The lingering scent beckoned me from outside the room and as I stepped forward the door was torn away before me. A group of leaches stood in my path but did not block it. They soon parted on each side and out walked Barbus. He stood proud among the many creatures that he commanded. He held out his hand and waited for me to take it. I wanted to go back into the cell, to run away, but my body moved forward, like I was being called to him. Closer I drew near him until I was within arm’s reach. He pulled me into his chest and embraced me and I could feel his strong muscles through his clothes as his hands traveled down my back making my flesh crawl.
     His fingers started to caress my body and for a moment it felt good, but I didn’t want this. I should be disgusted by him, but his breath on my neck took it all away. Without warning he grabbed a handful of my hair and pulled my head back exposing my throat, but I didn’t fight it. His lips traveled from the bottom of my neck and up to my ear lobe. My cheeks flushed with colour and my heart pounded rapidly inside my chest.
     “You won’t escape me.” he said. 
     His voice was strong and commanding and at that moment I felt I could do anything for this man. Something inside started to scream, telling me to run away, to never trust this beast of a man. A cruel smile graced his lips and he threw me towards the leaches like I was table scraps for the dogs. I lay on the floor while the leaches gathered around. 
     I woke myself up with a scream. Quickly, I placed my hands over my mouth when my brain realized what I was doing. I had blown open a small hole on the wall opposite me. I jumped out of bed to give it a look, hoping I didn’t do too much damage. Well at least I didn’t bring the place down.
     “Don’t worry about that.” said a voice behind me.
     I spun around to be greeted by Rhea who stood in the doorway. 
     “Uh, sorry ‘bout that.” I said.
     Rhea giggled and smiled. “I’m so glad to have you back Ellie, and it looks like your powers are slowly regaining as well.”
     I smiled weakly at her.
     Rhea made her way to my bed and sat, she tapped the spot beside her and I took my place. 
     “I’m sorry you had to go through this Ellie, as soon as those foul creatures took you I didn’t stop until I found you. I failed you. I should not have let this happen.” 
     I took both of her hands into mine and a surge of power flowed through me, fueling my once beaten body. I forgot how good it felt to touch her.
     “Rhea, you saved me.” I said to her “I almost gave up.”
     “I’m just relieved that I got to you in time.” Rhea pulled me close.
     It felt good being in her arms; my once troubled thoughts were gone.
     “Can I leave now?” I asked her.
     She took her time before answering. “Well you seem to have your powers back.” 
     “Well I feel fine, but it was a rough night.” I replied.
     “Then I think you’re ready to join us.” 
     “Us?” I was confused.
     Rhea led me from my room and out into a long corridor filled with other rooms on either side. I walked passed each of them expecting to see them locked up like I was, but inside were people of every age inside reading or listening to music. The rooms looked like bedrooms. Some of them were decorated with personal affects and posters of famous singers and shelf’s crammed with various kinds of books.
     “Rhea, who are these people?” I asked her.
     “They are guests here, looking for refuge.” She answered softly.
     “Refuge from what? Leaches?” 
      “Yes and no. This is a place where everyone can feel safe, runaway or not.” 
     I passed others in the corridor, some of them only kids. They looked scared and uncertain but as soon as Rhea passed their faces lit up. What were they doing here didn’t they have families to go home to?
     We left the rooms behind us and turned a corner into large seated area. It looked like a living room with sofas, TV’s, and electronic gadgets. It felt warm, comforting, like a real home. A feeling of guilt ran through me but I ignored it as best as I could and carried on with Rhea.
     “This is the living room.” she said.
     She left me to look around. Sitting on the sofa were a few people, they chatted amongst themselves, but as soon as they spotted us they stopped and stared. Without saying a word to them, I turned and caught up Rhea. At the next stop she showed me a small kitchen area. Inside was a small fridge at the side and a medium size table made of thick wood, it took its place in the center of the room and sitting at the table was Sophia eating her breakfast. Sophia’s eyes lit up once she saw me and gave a little wave. We then moved on throughout to see what else this place had to offer but Rhea came to a stop and turned to me.
     “I think you’ll want to use our next facility.” Rhea commented.
     Rhea pushed open the door to reveal a shower area that held small cubicles on either side. I didn’t know what she was showing me until I could hear flowing of water. I could not remember when it was the last time I had a shower.
     “I’ll leave you too it then.” she smiled.
     I jumped straight into the shower. It was small but I wasn’t complaining if it had hot running water. I pulled the lever towards myself and out jetted a stream of warm water. I stood there basked in the warm calming water. As I stood in the water I could feel everything being washed away like it was all a bad dream.
      I felt so much better after the shower it was like I was a new person. I dried myself with some fluffy towels and changed into the clothes Rhea kindly laid out for me. There was pair of black loose jeans and a tight cream coloured top, it wasn’t much but at least they were clean. I had been wearing the same stained torn clothes for weeks and they needed to go, badly. I threw my ragged clothes into the nearest bin and continued out of the shower area. My stomach started to growl with hunger so I decided to go and find the kitchen, if I could remember where it was. I walked through the cold halls, still trying to remember the way to the kitchen. As I turned a corner thinking for sure this was the way, I knocked into someone who gave a little yelp up.   
     “Oh I’m so sorry.” I said. 
     The young girl didn’t meet my gaze; instead she bent down and collected her fallen books. She checked for any damage and brushed off any dirt that stuck to it. Her head then snapped up into my direction and looked as if she was about to unleash her anger on me but she quickly held her tongue.
     “I know who you are.” she said.
     The girl who stood in front of me had wild frizzy chestnut brown hair which she repeatedly kept moving away from her big brown doe eyes. She looked a bit older than me but I couldn’t really tell. The girl hugged the book to her chest and stared at me as did all the others.
     “I cannot believe I’m seeing one up close.” said the staring girl.
     “I guess everyone knows about me now do they?” I asked.
     “Well everyone is talking about it and I mean everyone.” she replied.
     “I bet they want to see the freak, do they?” 
     “How can you say that about yourself? Most supernatural creatures would kill and I mean kill to get a chance to become a Siren.”
     “Thanks.” I mumbled.
     “Oh my god, I’m sorry. I have a bad habit of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. Let’s start again, my name’s Amanda.”
     Amanda adjusted her book and placed out her hand.
     “Oh sorry, there I go again.” Amanda quickly threw her hand behind her back.
     “I’m Ellie, but you probably knew that all ready.” I said.
     “Yeah, your kinda’ big news around here. Why don’t we sit in the living room, don’t think you’d want anyone else knowing your business in the hallway.”
     She was right; I didn’t want anyone overhearing us.  
     Amanda led the way into the decorated living room with the plush chocolate brown sofas along with colourful glass lamps scattered around the room. The room was empty apart from two of us. She then threw herself onto the large sofa while putting her book to one side.
     I just stood awkwardly next to the sofa, waiting for the invitation.
     “You can sit down you know, this is kinda’ your living room as well.”
     I took a seat next to Amanda who looked fit to burst with joy.
     “Go ahead.” I said to her.
     “What do you mean?”
     “I know you dying to ask me some questions.” I said to her.
     “Really!?” she turned in her seat and gave me her full attention. “What’s it like to be one? Have you made anyone fall deeply in love with you? Have you ever used a Siren scream?” words came spewing out and I felt like I wanted to run away.
     “Whoa, slow down.” I said.
     “Sorry, but really what’s it like?” she brought her voice down to normal level.
     “Truthfully? It’s horrible, I hate it.” I replied.
     “Really? I bet it would be amazing.” said Amanda.
      “You’re wrong, you’d think differently when you cannot touch anyone.”
     “Yeah, that does sound horrible.” she said.
     “It is. I hate it.” I replied.
     “But I’ve heard stories of Sirens that they can do anything they want, I wonder what it feels like?”
     Amanda held out her hand and looked at me with her big brown doe eyes.
     I quickly stood up from my seat. “What is wrong with you? Touching you could put you and myself in danger, never ask me to do that again.” 
     I was done talking with her. I left the living room with anger slowly bubbling away while looking for the kitchen again. 
     In the end I followed the smells of food to guide me and within minutes I found it. Sophia greeted me with her usual smile and offered me some food. I decided on some cereal. The kitchen was not big but it did have the basics. I sat down beside Sophia and eat my food. For a few minutes we continued in silence, like we were two complete strangers. I had to break the uncomfortable silence.
     “Where are we Sophia?” I asked.
     “Didn’t Rhea tell you?” she replied.
     I shook my head while shoveling the spoon into my mouth.
     “Well, we are underground.”
     “What!” Milk dribbled down my chin.
     No wonder everything was so cramped, we were living underground, but how? Was it safe underground? Did we have enough oxygen? 
     “Yeah, I thought she would have told you. This place used to be a bomb shelter and it’s now a converted hideout where supernatural’s can come when they’ve got nowhere else to go.”
     “Are we safe down here then?” I asked her
     “Totally safe.” she said with her soft voice.
     “So these runaways are like me then?” I asked.
     “Yes, you could say that.”
     “Some of them are very young.” I commented.
     “That’s the worst part of it they have nowhere to go since some of their families have been killed.”
     “By the leaches.” I didn’t need Sophia to tell me that. Those disgusting creatures have destroyed everything that is good. 
     As Sophia and I were talking, a big brute of a young man came into the kitchen. His eyes caught mine and I felt fear. I dug my nails into my chair as I watched him grab something from the small fridge. As he left I saw something shimmer with light from his belt.
     “Who the hell was that?” I asked. 
     “Don’t worry about him, he’s part of the protectors.” Sophia said.
     “Protectors?” I was completely lost.
     “Yeah they are an order of people who protect the supernatural world. You could call them the police of your world.”
     “But he looks terrifying.” I replied.
     “Ah, they are kittens really, they put their lives on the line for us.” 
     “Well I feel a little better, I think.” I said.
     “You should, you are safe here, Ellie.” she tried to reassure me but the words didn’t offer me any comfort.
     I paused at my unfinished meal and I wiped my face. 
     “Uh, Sophia.” I wanted her full attention.
     “What is it Ellie?” she asked.
     “About Rhea’s manor, you got hurt because of me. I’m so sorry.” I said.
     Sophia didn’t say anything she just stared at me.
     “Please forgive me, please.” I begged her.
     “I forgive you, but it really wasn’t your fault.” Her perfect pink lips curved up into a smile.
     “Of course it was my fault, I made it happen. If I hadn’t been there none of this would have happened.”
     “Ellie, I don’t blame you and neither does Rhea. She was worried sick about trying to find you.” answered Sophia.
     “I’m glad that she did, it was horrible down there, Sophia.”
     “I cannot even begin to imagine, Ellie.”
     “At one point I just wanted it all to go away and let the darkness take me away.” I said.
     Sophia just stared at me lost for words.
     We continued with our breakfast in silence. I finished the last of my cereal and put it into the small metal sink. I turned around and Rhea stood in the kitchen, waiting. She always had the ability of sneaking up on me and I think she got some kind of kick out of it.
     “Ellie, can we talk?” she said seductively.
     I nodded while waved goodbye to Sophia and followed Rhea down the hallway. We walked together down a narrow hallway. As soon as Rhea passed, the other residents would stop and bow or politely call her ma’am. (Should I be doing that as well?) I tried to keep up with her but my little legs were not quick enough. As soon as they were done with their bowing they would turn their gaze onto me and stare in awe, after a while it got very awkward. 
     Rhea stopped in front of a large door covered with engravings of weird symbols that looked like giant eyes with crosses through them. She held it open while I quickly hurried on into the unknown room. Inside was a bedroom much nicer than the one I was in. It had a four poster bed with silk curtains draped on either side along with matching pillows and cream coloured blankets.  She also had her own en suite (fancy) and a large make-up dressing table that was covered with unknown creams and remedies inside weirdly shaped thin glass bottles. (Not that she needs the beauty treatment). Rhea walked in and sat down into a plush chair and crossed her legs. I sat down on the other chair opposite her and I just stared down at my hands nervously. 
     “Ellie.” She began to speak. “You destroyed my house.”
     My heart dropped, does she want to punish me after what I did. “I’m so sorry.” I tried to explain but she brought up her hand and stopped me.
     “Not many people can do that, I’m impressed.” 
     “So you’re not mad?” 
     “No, it’s just a house, Ellie. It can be rebuilt.” she gave me a reassuring smile and a wave of relief washed over me. 
     “Thanks.” I said.
     “So how are you feeling?”  
     Rhea’s question threw me. I hadn’t really stopped and thought how I was feeling. I just tried to hide my emotions as best as I could.
     “It’s difficult.” I said.
     “I must say you are dealing with it very well.”
     “It’s just one of my talents I’ve developed over the years.” I replied.
     “It is a remarkable talent indeed, even I cannot read your emotions.” commented Rhea.
     I remained silent, awkwardly shifting in my chair.
     “You are safe here, Ellie. I mean that this time.”
     “Yeah.” I mumbled.
     “Ellie, do you blame me?” she asked.
     “No, never. It’s just things are so messed up.” I answered.
     “I can understand, it’s all so different for you now and you have to adjust to it the best you can.”
     “Yeah.” It was all I could say.
     “Good. I wanted to talk to you about certain things that have happened.”
     “Like what?” I didn’t really want to talk about things.
     “Well, first. That man who abducted you.”
     “Oh yeah, he knew you didn’t he, but how?” I asked.
     “Well I have a long dark history with Barbus, and that’s how I want to keep it.” She spoke with such hate for him.
     “He asked for me to join him, but I told him no.” 
     “Interesting, what else did he say?” 
     “Well he said that I was his.” Just thinking about him made me feel ill “the leaches also listened to him, like he was commanding them.”
     Rhea remained sat in her chair and I could see her mind working. “Mmm, Barbus is hardly the brains behind this, but we should be carefully none the less.”
     “Yeah, He makes my skin crawl.” I replied.
     “He does seem to have that effect of some people. I hated him ever since the first time I met him.”
     I wanted to ask Rhea a personal question, but I didn’t know if I would be over-stepping. I took a deep breath and just let it out.
     “Rhea, what are you?” I interrupted.
     Rhea looked at me and gave a little smile.
     She cleared her throat. “I am what you would called a demi-god my dear.” 
     Wait, what! A god?! Did she really say that? “Sorry, can you explain?” 
     “A demi-god, surely you have heard the word before?”
     “No, not really. They don’t teach us that in school.”
     “Well they should.” she said.
     My tired mind tried to come to terms with Rhea being a god, but I just could not continue that train of thought.  
     I tried to muffle a giggle, I was sitting next to a god! “Were you born one then?”
     “No, I was..” Rhea cut herself off. She had a blank stare across her face. A cold icy stare formed in her flame coloured eyes. I had brought up memories that she wasn’t ready to divulge yet.
     “Rhea, you ok?” 
     She brought herself back with a smile.
 “That’s a tale for another day.” Rhea stood up from her chair and started to pace around the room. I just sat and watched her float effortlessly around her bedroom.
     Another piece of information came to light inside my still weak mind. 
     “Oh yeah, my doctor was with them. He treated me when I was in the hospital after the..” Just thinking back about the hospital was a bad idea. It seemed ages ago when I laid in that hospital bed. I tried to throw off the guilty words that surrounded me.
     “Your doctor? That’s strange. Did you notice anything weird about him?”
     Her question pulled me from my self doubt. 
     “Come to think of it, yes. It was like he didn’t want to be there, like he was being forced to do it.”
     Rhea was about to say something but there was a gentle knock on the bedroom door.
     “Enter.” She ordered.
     A large tall man appeared, the same guy from the kitchen. He had a strong presence about him. He looked me up and down with interest and I had to resist the urge to blush. He then gave his full attention to Rhea.
     “I have information.” he spoke but he remained quiet.
     “You can report, she’s fine.” his eyes gave me another glace before he reported his findings.
     “Yes mistress. There have been numerous reports of leaches roaming around in public, and with many numbers.”
     Rhea paused to take in all the information. 
     “It’s very unlike them to attack in public, and you say there are many of them?”
     “Yes, mistress. They are at a very high level, close to the danger zone.” he said.
     “She must been breeding them. This isn’t a good sign.” Rhea said to herself.
     “Breeding?” I was totally lost.
     “Yes Ellie, leaches don’t breed like normal people they get birthed about ten at a time or even more, but these numbers are high.”
     “We’ve had some protectors gone missing while hunting for the nest also.” he spoke with a formal tone.
     Rhea started to think again. “What does the council say about this?” she asked the strong young man.
        “They want us to deal with it quickly and quietly. They want you to front the operation.”
     “Thank you Marcus, we will leave first thing in the morning. If that’s all you can go.” she waved him off.
     He bowed his head and left, closing the door behind him.
     “Where are you going tomorrow?” I asked.
     “To find a nest of leaches and you, my dear will be coming with me.”
     “What?!” I blurted out.
     I’m surprised that Rhea wanted me to accompany her down into a leach nest. “You want to put me back in danger again? After what I’ve been through?
     “Yes and I know what you must be thinking, but you will be safe with me and I don’t want you out of my sight.” Her soft voice was like music to my ears, but I had to try to resist it.
     “That’s what you said last time and you know what happened.” I stood up from my chair in protest.
     Rhea took a deep sigh. “That will never happen again. I will put my life on the line if it means your safety.” 
     Was this all going to happen again? No, I won’t let it. I won’t let them take me again.
     “I need to think about this, I cannot go back to that dungeon. I won’t!” I ran out of the room and down the corridor pushing past Sophia.
     “Ellie?” she called after me but I didn’t stop.
     I ran back to my room trying to avoid the many runaways that filled the halls. I closed my door hoping it did not lock me in. I just wanted to scream, I felt trapped. I would not allow myself to go through that again. I clenched my teeth together wishing that the rage would pass. Rhea had no right to be putting me in that position again.







Chapter Five

      It was getting late but I was too upset to sleep and my stomach started to growl in protest. I decided to get a snack from the kitchen. Quietly, I walked down the many halls, not wanting to disturb the others. Some of the runaways were in the sitting room reading or just chatting quietly away to each other. Every room had at least two protectors watching over their charges, once they saw me they would watch me with interest. Many of the runaways smiled and waved at me while I walked past trying to find the kitchen. Slowly, I was finding my way around this maze; god knows how many corridors there are. I would have to get used to this place sooner or later and right now I just wanted to find the kitchen to get some food.
      The kitchen was devoid of people, it was nice not to have the idle chit-chat with a total stranger, I prefer my own company. I opened up the fridge and it greeted me with its cold chill. Inside was food different variety of foods with fancy names that I hadn’t really heard of. I didn’t even know what half of it was and I didn’t want to go around smelling them if they were edible. I didn’t know whether to put it on my face or eat it. Instead I settled for some toast, it amazed me that they had electricity down here. I prepared my toast and sat in the kitchen eating in silence.
     I was almost done with my simple snack when I could hear footsteps coming towards the kitchen. Was I allowed out at this time of night? Crap, crap. I quickly tried to tidy up the crumbs I had left but it was too late. Behind me I could hear someone clearing their throat. Oh crap!
     I turned around to be greeted by one of the protectors that I had met inside Rhea’s room. Was he stalking me? 
     “Sorry, I’ll just move on. I should get back to bed anyway.” I said sheepishly.
     I tried to tip toe around him, but his words stopped me.   
     “You’re Ellie aren’t you?” he asked and I stopped dead.
     “Yeah, why?” I asked.
     He leaned on the wall and crossed his strong arms around his chest. “Just that I’ve heard things about you that’s all, good things though.” He added.
     I chuckled nervously. Oh god I’m acting like a school girl. (Well I am one.)
     “Well I’m glad people have been saying good things about me, for a change.” I said to him.
     “What do you mean?” he asked.
     “Uh, it’s nothing. Rhea said your name was Marcus, was it?”
     “Yep, that’s me.” He then smiled with a devilish grin.
     “So you’re here to protect us then? I don’t really know what’s going on around here. I’m kinda’ new to the whole supernatural scene.” 
     “Well if you have any questions you should come to me.” he said “I’m new to this whole protector thing myself, I only became one a few weeks ago and they send me here, but I am not complaining.”
     “Are you enjoying it?” I asked.
     “Yeah, it runs in the family. Even my past generations were in the protectors, so I’m doing my family proud.” he said.
     “What do the protectors do anyway?” Marcus laughed and I felt my cheeks flush with colour.
     As Marcus moved his belt shimmered with light as it did before. With a closer look, strapped to his belt was a long thin sword sheathed in its holder. Did they really need these with them?
     “You really are new to the scene aren’t you?” he cleared his throat “well the jobs in the title, the protectors, we help supernatural beings like yourself, when they are in need. And sometimes we do special jobs, like tomorrow. Are you coming with us?”
     I didn’t really know how to answer his question. “Maybe, I don’t know yet.”
     “I’ll protect you, it’s my job after all.” he said with a wink.
     “I’ve had many people claiming to protect me.” I said.
     “There’s nothing to worry about.” replied Marcus.
     “You’d think, but there is always that doubt at the back of your mind that everything could go wrong in a matter of seconds.”
     Marcus didn’t give an answer, he just remained quiet.
     “I think I should go back to bed.” I mumbled.
     “Night.” he replied.
     I walked back to my room with a silly school-girl grin across my face.
     
I awoke from my peaceful sleep to see Sophia’s face inches from mine while and I screamed in fright. Sophia was thrown back a few steps before putting up one of her barriers just in time.
     Quickly, I shot up from the bed. “I’m so sorry Sophia.” 
     “It was my own fault Ellie. I shouldn’t have woken you.”
     “What were you doing?” I asked her.
     “Watching you sleep.” she replied.
     “Are you ok?” I didn’t want to hurt her.
     Sophia regained her composure.
     “It’s fine, really. I came to tell you we are getting ready to leave.” 
     Leave? They must’ve been getting ready to leave for the mission. I didn’t really want to go but did I even have a choice? Will Rhea let me out of her sight again?
     “Just to tell you, I’m going as well.” she said.
     “What? Why? Shouldn’t we leave things like that to those protectors?” I asked her.
     “Well I have been on a few missions with Rhea before, besides I’m quite excited for it.” I could feel the excitement flowing from her. “We know what we are doing; you’ll be safe with us.” Sophia walked out of the room and l quickly got dressed.
     The many runaways filled the halls, all trying to get a peek at the leaving party. I carefully weaved my way through the adoring crowd, where Rhea, Marcus and Sophia stood waiting for me.
     “Morning.” said Marcus.
     “So you have decided to join us then?” Rhea asked.
     “Like I have a choice.” I mumbled.
     “I’m glad.” she replied.
     I looked around at the small crew, was this it? I didn’t really feel much safe with just a small group.
     “Is this it?” I asked them.
     “No there is one more, he is late.” Rhea’s tone was sharp.
     From within the crowd there were shoving and unhappy yelps. Something was moving towards us and it wasn’t in a good mood. 
     “Move, move out of the way.” said a voice from the crowd.
     The group of people parted revealing a middle age short man. “Him?” I asked surprised.
     “Yes, missy, me.” he said as he came closer.
     “Ellie do not be deceived by his small stature, we all have our uses, even him.” said Rhea.
     “Charming, Com’on I’ve got places to be and I don’t want to be here anyway.” The balding man said.
     “Robin, you owe me. So you will do this for me.” Rhea said. 
     “Where are we going?” I asked.
     “There has been lots of leach activity outside of the city, so we are going to check it out.” Marcus answered.
     “But shouldn’t we have more protectors with us?” I asked.
     “No, they need to stay here and we only need a small group otherwise we will attract attention.” Rhea explained.  
     We all formed a circle, Rhea on my right and Marcus on my left. He was about to take his hand when I quickly flinched away.
     “Sorry.” He quickly said.
     “Uh, no it’s my fault.” I blushed.
     “Ready?” Rhea’s voice carried throughout the small halls. The group of runaways stepped back allowing us to safely teleport.
     Before I could prepare myself, I was torn away from the underground hall and sent spiraling off into different directions. My stomach filled with knots and I wanted to throw up. We all landed onto a soft ground and I had to sit down for my head to stop spinning. 
     “You ok?” Marcus asked.
     I waited for my dizzy head to fade before I was ready to join them. “Yeah, I’m fine.”  
     “Remember, stay close and no one do anything stupid that can get us killed.” Marcus’s eyes were on the new guy.  
     “What’re you looking at me for?” he said.
     Robin and Marcus were talking (well arguing) while I looked around. We had teleported outside a city entrance that was bellow a busy motorway. It was very early in the morning and the sun was about to rise. I wanted to take a seat and watch but I knew I didn’t have time. I stood close to Sophia and she greeted me with a soft smile.
     “Are you nervous, Ellie?” Sophia asked.
     “Just a bit.” I replied.
     “Just stay close to Rhea and you’ll be fine.” Sophia gave me one of her brightest smiles and inside it did make me feel a bit better, but I still had doubts.
     Marcus and Robin were still arguing and Rhea had to step in.  
     “Gentlemen, please. Can we finish this.” asked Rhea.  
     Marcus nodded. “Stay close.” he whispered. 
     Rhea made her way to a large sewer pipe leading deep into a complex of twisting tunnels that was the underground sewer system. We all followed behind her one by one into the dark tunnels. The smell was awful, the memories of the leaches flooded in and I tried to ignore them swimming around in my mind. I could feel myself tensing up, I just wanted to run away, but how could I face Rhea again if I did that? I didn’t want to keep running from my problems all the time. I took a deep breath of the tainted air and continued through the dark winding tunnel.
     Marcus tailed behind, his sword at his side ready to strike at anything that would harm us. I had nothing to fear while he was at my back, It was his job to protect me. 
     “Are you ok?” he whispered into my ear.
     I tried to muffle my surprise with both hands clasped to my mouth.
     “Don’t do that! I don’t like being snuck up on.” I whispered back.
     Again he came in close to give me his answer. “Sorry.” He whispered deeply into my ear and my body exploded with excitement. (Focus, Ellie!)
     We continued through the sewers and stopped. In front of us the stone floor was no more, murky water had taken its place instead.
     “I’m not walking through that.” I said
     “It’s only water Ellie.” Marcus whispered.
     “Ellie’s right, and plus it stinks.” added Sophia.
     “Oh for heaven’s sake.” Rhea took the first steps into the water while waiting for the others.
     “Fine, but you owe me new shoes.” Sophia said.
     “If that’s what gets you to move.” Rhea said.
      The bog filled water filtered through my shoes and socks, it didn’t feel good and it made me feel a bit sick. As we waded through the dirty water Rhea stopped, I peered around her and out in front stood many entrances, we didn’t know which way to go.  
     “Can you sense anything, Robin?” whispered Rhea. 
     He placed his palms and his ear to the slime covered stone and closed his eyes. His face scrunched up and his eyes flickered rapidly from side to side.
     “What’s he doing?” I asked.
     “He’s trying to sense supernaturals.” Sophia replied.
     “Hush, I’m trying to concentrate.” Robin ordered.
     His eyes shot open and he backed away from the wall slowly. “They’re here, many of them.”
     “Good, now go find them.” Rhea said.
     “Are you serious, I’m not going into the heart of that!” he said.
     “Keep your voice down!” Marcus ordered.
      “I’m getting the hell out of here.” Robin added.
     He tied to push passed but Marcus stood in his way.
     “Hey, if I’m here so are you. We stick together.” I whispered harshly.
     “But you’re the Siren, the all and powerful.” He said.
     “Yes, but I’m petrified at the same time, I feel like running away but I don’t because I know I’ll never forgive myself. So shut up and deal with it.” I told him.
     Robin breathed a deep sigh and took his place.
     As I said my piece, I could feel all eyes on me. I looked around, realizing that everyone just stood there, watching me.
     “What?” I asked them.
     “It’s nothing, just sometimes I forget how strong you really are.” replied Rhea
     I was shocked at her comment, was everyone else in agreement? Well I didn’t really feel strong.
     Robin pushed forward through the bog water and we followed after him.
     “It’s this way.” He pointed to the far right of the many tunnels and we continued on through the darkness.
      The tunnel scuttled with rats and worms and other strange looking creatures that ran away from our approach. I followed behind Sophia, careful of where I stepped. The smells were getting worse, and I had to put my hand over my mouth to stop myself from gagging on the foul fumes. Marcus held his sword high, ready to strike. I felt a bit relived with him at my back and at the same time nervous. Robin took us down more narrow walkways with slime covered walls. What the hell was this stuff, I didn’t really want to give it a full examination. Weird noises echoed through the sewer tunnels. Scratching, scuttling and muffled moans. Where the hell were we going? Wherever it was it didn’t sound good.
     We were ordered to stop, Robin stood his ground to make sure the way was clear.
     “There is something around the corner.” whispered Robin.
     I held my breath. The creature made its all too familiar groaning noises. Visions of being back in the dark pits came rushing back and I tried to fight them off. Finally the leach slowly appeared around the corner while we all remained still as it sniffed the air. The faceless creature snapped its head in my direction and the all knowing terror rippled through me. Before it could make any noise, Rhea threw out her hand and black ash scattered into the air.
     “That was a close one, he could have warned others.” Marcus said.
     “Let’s keep going.” Rhea added.
     We stepped over the creature’s pile of ashes and carried on down the maze of dark tunnels. I wanted to hold onto Marcus’s hand and never let go, but that was never going to happen. 
     “It’s just up ahead, you better be ready.” Robin told us.
     My hands started to shake and my forehead ran with sweat. I tried to throw off the horrible feeling and walked on. The tunnels opened up into a large clearing with what looked like frog spawn covering the walls and the floor. The slime covered sacks littered around the area, inside something was moving around, trying to claw its way out.
     “Ugh, it stinks.” I said while covering my mouth. 
     “Yep, it does, but don’t think about it too much.” Marcus replied.
     While looking around for any of the leaches my body froze. Lying on the floor was a body, it was of young girl. Darkness had hid her face from me and I moved closer to get a better look at the laid out body. Once I saw the face I stumbled back in shock, it was the cheep blonde from the cinema. Her body displayed bite marks and scratches to the face and stomach. I had to tear my eyes away from the lifeless body. That could have easily been Becky or Lilly on the floor, the thought of my friends taking her place made me sick but I had to move on.
     “Are you ok, Ellie?” Marcus asked.
    I didn’t say anything I just pointed to where the young girl laid. Marcus moved closer to the body, inspecting what was left of her.
     “Did you know her?” he asked.
     “No, not really, I met her at a cinema and I used my powers on her, she wasn’t a nice person but to have this done to her, it’s wrong.”
     “What did you find?” Rhea asked.
     “Just the leaches prey.” answered Marcus.
     “Alive?” she asked bluntly.
     I replied to Rhea with a shake of my head.
     “Where are the leaches, Robin?” Marcus asked.
     “I don’t know, I sensed it, they should be here.” Robin replied.
     “Can you sense anything, Rhea?” Sophia asked.
     “There is something, but it’s faint.”  
     Tapping noises surrounded us, each coming from a different direction. They were trying to distract us. 
     “What that?” asked Sophia.
     “It’s them, they are playing with us.” I answered. The tapping noise brought back the memory of the leaches invading my home. It’s because of them that I had to leave. 
     “Agreed, they are toying with us.” Rhea brought her hands out and a bright light radiated from her palms. The white glow illuminated the entire area, showing us all the horrors that the tunnels had to offer. The shadows could not conceal the hidden leaches anymore. Once they saw the light they fled into their holes, hoping to avoid the blinding aura.
     “Is that it?” I asked out loud.
     “That was far too easy.” replied Marcus.
     The tapping noise returned and it was pissing me off.
     “I can hear you, show yourself!” cried Rhea.
     Something moved above us with such speed that I could only make out as a blur. I took a step back while the others moved forward. Marcus held his sword high, ready to strike. Something crashed to the ground shaking the floor around us. I lost my balance and fell backwards into the slime. I looked up from the ground to see something that almost looked human. The torso was of a beautiful woman with long silver hair covering her naked breasts. But the lower half of her was of something I’d never thought I would witness in my entire life. The creature had a snake’s lower body with a large scaly tale that coiled around her womanly shape. I slowly got to my feet and backed away from the creature. 
     “What brings you here, Rhea?” The beast spoke.
     Rhea slowly walked up to the creature. She remained calm and steady as she eyes the monstrous woman. 
     “We have come for you, Idina.” said Rhea.
     The naked woman laughed. Her shrill cackle made my skin crawl.
     Marcus moved closer brandishing his sword. 
     “So you’ve brought back-up? You’re getting sloppy she-witch.” The creature slithered across the room, no one dared to move. The woman who called herself Idina slithered with ease along the dilapidated slugged infested floor. I was too scared to move, nothing I had seen so far had prepared me for this. The woman moved passed and I held my breath, hoping she would not notice me. 
     “Are these things for me?” It asked. “I’m so glad you brought me presents, I haven’t had a plaything in a long while, well since that thing.” The creature pointed its sharp black claws in the direction of the young blonde girl. I felt sick inside, no one deserved that, not even her.
     “Do you think I’d give you anything, creature?” Rhea asked it.
     Idina’s eyes flashed a dark glow and I thought the two of them would come to blows, but her attention was focused onto something else. It was Marcus who had caught her eye. She moved towards him like he was an unopened present at Christmas. It caressed at his strong body, seeing if he was up to scratch. His face, covered with disgust. I watched as Marcus slowly readied his weapon. 
     “I wouldn’t do that if I were you.” around us, leaches started to crowd around. We were trapped. Idina placed her hands tightly around Marcus’s body and slowly licked his cheek with her slick black tongue. He tried to move but her grip was strong as were her nails. She tore at his skin and he tried to fight the pain. 
     “Maybe you could be my new plaything? I’ll take good care of you.” she whispered.
     “Enough!” shouted Rhea.
     The creature’s soulless black eyes focused onto Rhea. “If you do not behave yourselves, I will have you torn apart!” she spat.
     The leaches crept closer, just waiting for the word to strike.
     “Do you like my children?” she finally ignored Marcus and slithered over to one of her leaches. The snake-woman gently stroked its grime covered face, the leach smiling with glee. The others sensed the attention and move in. The sickening smiling leach snarled at the others, warning them to back off.  
     “Now, now, you’ll all get your turn.” Idina said to her sickening children.
     “They have been roaming around unchecked, Idina.” Rhea said “they have been killing innocents, and that cannot go unpunished.”
     “My children would do no such thing, and how dare you accuse them!” Idina’s temper flared.
     The five of us closed in on each other. We had to stick together. Things were going to go south fast.
     “I think we’ve talked enough-.” The naked woman’s eyes found mine and stopped mid-sentence.
     “Well, well. What have we here?” the creatures eye found mine but before she could move, Rhea and Marcus stood in her path, cutting off her view. “Is that the creature everyone’s been talking about? She doesn’t look like much, does she?” 
     “I think we should leave, I’m having a bad feeling about this.” Robin whispered.
     “I haven’t finished with you yet!” it screamed. The woman sprung forward with her claws outstretched. 
     Sophia quickly stepped forward and created a barrier around us, protected from the hideous creatures.
     “Barbus said you would come, he was right.” said Idina as she circled around the barrier. “He will reward me when I give him the girl.”
     Rhea snatched my arm and the rest held hands together, ready to leave this hell hole. I waited for the stomach churning ride, but nothing happened. 
     “Rhea?” Sophia said.
     The snake creature started to laugh. “He also gave me a few tips on how to trap you. You cannot leave.”
     No, I would not let them capture me again, I won’t. I was in full panic mode. My fight or flight mode kicked in and everything pointed to flight.
     Robin lifted his hands out to one of the leaches. It began flinching violently on the spot. Within a few seconds it turned to its mother and pounced on her like a crazed animal. Idina grabbed it by the throat and quickly snapped its neck, a quick death. She screamed a high pitch wail that tried to tear its way into my skull. I fell to knees and hopped for the pain to end.
     “What did you do that for?” shouted Marcus
     “I was just trying something!” Robin replied.
     “You’ve just pissed her off even more!” 
     “Guys, I cannot hold this barrier all day.” Sophia commented. 
     Idina spat a yellow substance at the barrier and it slowly degraded around us. I sat on the floor, panicking. They would lock me up again, and no one would save me this time. My heart thumped in my chest and I tried to calm myself down but all of the horrid memories came rushing in one by one. My body felt like stone, I couldn’t move. 
     The group chatted above me, each offering a way out but then another voice would cut in and call the plan a failure. They shouted at each other while the snake woman laughed at our failed attempt to hatch a plan.
     “I cannot hold it!” Sophia screamed. 
     “Ellie.” A soft voice said. “We need your help.”
     “Hurry they are getting through over here.” a voice called out.
     I was sick of this, I always afraid of what was around the corner and always afraid of myself, not knowing what I was capable of. I didn’t want to listen to the person in front of me. I wanted to block it all out, no more. I didn’t want this! 
     “Ellie, can you hear me.” again the voice tried to get through to me.
     Screams and yells filled my ears. I placed my hands over my ears to try and block it out.
     “Ellie!” this time the calm voice was filled with terror.
     I needed to do something, they needed me. 
     I stood up and tried to call on the pain of being abused at the hand of the leaches and torment I suffered. I screamed and my voice shattered the barrier, destroying the leaches that blocked our path. We all backed away from the coiling creature and her leach army and headed back the way we came. We had to get out, fast.
     I hurried with the rest of the group while Rhea and Marcus dispatched any followers. Robin led us through the maze of pipes and tunnels that seem never ending. He tried to remember the way out but fear fueled his decisions.
     Adrenaline fueled my body and my mind was sharp, I felt as if I could run all night without stopping. As we carried on another leach jumped down and blocked our path, we didn’t have time for this crap. I screamed and the leach was sent spiraling through the air and impaled by a thick steel rod right through the chest. The dying leach screamed in agony before finally submitting to its bloody death. Robin was first to run off and I hurried after him back through the tunnels.
     “Do you know where you’re going?” I asked the balding man. 
     “Yes!” he said over his shoulder, but I didn’t really hold much faith in him.   
     I pounded the floor until my heart became heavy inside my chest. Behind me I could hear screeches of dying leaches and flashes of white bright light. My lungs burned with each new breath, but I had to keep pushing myself. Marcus quickly caught up to me with sweat covering his body and a bloody sword in his right hand. He kept his pace steady with mine and I caught a glimpse of him as he was running and he had a huge grin on his face.
     “What you smiling for?” I asked breathlessly.
     “It’s the chase, I was born for this.” He said.
     “That’s comforting, not.” I replied.      
      We came to a stop at a ladder leading up to the surface. Robin was the first to climb, then Sophia.
     “She-witch!” the creature screamed as it slithered towards us with great speed. Many leaches ran behind her hoping to get a taste of their next meal.
      Rhea faced the woman; she reached out with her radiant white hands and above her pulled the lose pipes towards the ground. She had blocked their path.
     I hurried up the ladder with Marcus right behind me. I quickly gripped each bar as fast as my hands could. The fresh air welcomed me back from the dark tunnels and I fell to the ground near Sophia and we both gasped for our breath as if it was our last.
     “That was a failed effort, wasn’t it?” wheezed Robin. 
     “Big time!” Marcus replied.
     “That was a trap.” Rhea said.
     “You think?” Robin said sarcastically.
     “What the hell was that thing?” I asked.
     “I’ve never seen anything like that before.” Sophia added.
     I turned to Rhea expecting answers but her eyes never left the dark manhole. “We were almost eaten by those things.” I said.
     “If Robin kept his cool, we could have avoided it.” Marcus pointed the finger at Robin.
     “I was doing something, unlike you who was flirting away with that thing.” Robin shouted.
     Marcus face filled with rage.
     I thought the two of them would have a fight right in front of me but Rhea pushed out with her hands and sent the two of them flying in opposite directions.
     “Enough!” her voice roared. “We need to get back and report this, now.”
     There was silence among us. We had failed our mission from the council and nearly gotten killed in the process.  
     Rhea again grabbed my hand and we teleported away from the sewers and back to the safety of the underground bunker. My feet touched the ground and the stench hit me like a punch to the stomach. My eyes focused on the grisly scene in front of us. Blood splattered the walls along with screams echoing throughout the halls. 











Chapter Six

     The runaways lay on the floor in a pool of their own blood. Deep slashes and bite marks littered their bodies, they died a horrible death. I just stared at their bodies, their faces had frozen in their last moments of their life. I had enough of seeing dead bodies, I wanted to be sick.  When will it end? Marcus rushed down to a dead Protector, did he know him? Marcus slowly closed his glassy stare. Out the corner of my eye something was approaching fast. It was a leach and it was heading straight for Marcus.
     “Marcus!” I yelled.
     He readied his weapon as it came charging in. He ended its life with one quick swing. More screams and shouts came from the sleeping quarters and other corridors. It was a massacre and we were in the middle of it. 
      “Ellie, stay here, I need to go and get something.” Rhea ran off leaving the four of us behind.
     “I’m outta’ here, bye.” Robin said as he ran through the halls looking for a quick exit.
     “Wait.” I called. 
     “Coward.” shouted Marcus.
     I wanted to do something, to try and save these kids but was it too late. I needed to do something. I ran towards Rhea, leaving behind Sophia and Marcus. I came to a corridor with many blood stains across the white walls. I ran passed the fallen residents and tried to find Rhea as fast as I could. As I rushed passed, something caught my eye. I quickly hid myself behind the wall, thinking it was a leach looking for its next meal. I slowly peered around the wall to see a leach crouched over something. I came away from the wall to see the disgusting creature feeding on someone. The wild unkempt hair gave it away. The leach had killed Amanda, and it was draining her dry.
     I quietly stepped forward, hoping to catch it off guard. I screamed my disgust at it and the creature was blown away crashing through a wall. The small roof supporting us had taken a beating from my scream, I had to be careful with my powers, I didn’t want to burry us, but it was worth it for Amanda. I took one look at her, her hair wet with her own blood, it covered half of her face but I still knew it was her. The guilt tore into me. I wished I wasn’t so hard on her. None of them deserved this, nobody did. Why did this have to happen?
     “Ellie?” said a voice behind me.
     I turned around to be greeted by Rhea who now held a strangely familiar large tome under her arm. I just stared at her with tears forming in my eyes. “How could anyone do this?” I asked.
    “I’m sorry, Ellie.” she replied.
     I took off with Rhea without looking back at the destruction the leaches had caused. We returned to where Sophia and Marcus stood their ground against the many monsters.
     “Where have you been?” asked a pissed off Marcus.
     I tried not to meet his gaze with tears in my eyes but he could already see them.  
     Sophia’s face lit up as she saw Rhea.  
     More leaches came out from their hiding place and surrounded us with their blood covered talons, fresh from the kill. Marcus stepped forward brandishing his blade. One leach made a quick grab for me but he killed it with one clean strike. I was about to scream but I remembered about nearly burying myself. My powers were useless.
     They rushed at us, ready to taste us.
     Rhea’s bright light engulfed us, turning the leaches into ash one by one. 
     “Where were you?” Sophia asked with panic in her voice.
     “I had to get this.” Rhea held out a large tome. 
     “What’s that?” Marcus asked.
     “It is something that can save us.” she explained. It was the same book I saw in Rhea’s house. It must be very important if she willing to go through a crowd of leaches for it.
     “Where’s Robin?” asked Rhea.
     No one spoke. “He ran away didn’t he?” The coward  had run away with his tail tucked between his legs.
     “Yeah, he saw the bodies and took off.” said Sophia.
     While we were caught up talking, a few leaches spotted us and headed our way. 
     “Enough about the book, what do we do?” Marcus shouted while cutting through the oncoming leaches.
     I looked at Rhea for her all-knowing advice. Her face was grim and colourless.
     “We leave.” she said.
     “What?!” Marcus asked with rage in his voice.
     How can Rhea leave them? Did she really check for anyone that could be alive? 
     “Are you sure, what about survivors?” asked Sophia.
     Rhea remained silent.
     “There may be people hiding, scared for their lives.” I tried to find a reason to go look for them but I knew there was no one else.
     “Ellie, there’s nothing back there, but death you’ve seen it with your own eyes. We need to leave.” Rhea’s voice was steady.
     I looked over at Marcus who was now walking back and forth seething with anger. He was fighting for his fallen brothers, for their honor. How could we leave?
     “Marcus, you need to come with us.” Rhea said.
     “I will not leave, I will fight!” he roared.
     “Marcus, there’s nothing left.” whispered Sophia. She tried to put her hand onto his shoulder but he quickly shook it off. He didn’t want to know.
     “Marcus?” I called.
     Rhea walked up to the grief stricken young man and grabbed his hand, Sophia and I quickly followed by holding onto her. My stomach started to knot and I was pulled away from the bloody scene. I could see Marcus trying to fight Rhea’s hold she had on him, but her grip was vice tight.
     I landed on my feet this time, but I landed on hard cracked ground. I was getting good at teleportation but this was no time for celebration. Marcus pulled away from Rhea with a grunt. 
     “Why’d you do that?!” he asked.
     “You would have died, I saved you.” she answered.
     “That wasn’t your call. I had sworn an oath to my brothers in arms.”
     “I didn’t want to see anymore protectors’ die.” she replied. 
     Marcus walked away and I could feel his rage pulsing inside him. He paced back and forth mumbling to himself and I wanted to tell him that everything was going to be ok, but how could I tell him that, after all the misery we had witnessed. It would have been a lie, and I would convince no one of it.
     I looked up into the sky and took a deep breath, I tried to forget what we all had witnessed, freezing cold air whipped around us with ice white clouds towering over us in the air. It was a grim day and I felt it fit the mood.
     “Where are we, Rhea?” Sophia asked.
     “An old friend’s house, we were once sisters, but I have not seen her in some time now.” Rhea explained.
     “Will we be safe?” Sophia asked.
     “No where’s safe anymore.” Marcus added.
     I just stared at Marcus as his face was formed into a grim sadness. I wish I could have made him feel better, but what could I have done?
     I looked around. We stood on muddy forest path leading up to a wooden bridge over looking a large river. The bridge was connected to a large stone door that stood ten feet tall. The sturdy stone wall surrounded whatever was inside, or to keep whatever was inside locked up. Rhea was first across the bridge. I watched her effortlessly cross it with grace while I slowly crept my way along, fearing for my life with every step I took.
     Rhea waited for us to cross, she then stepped forward and placed her free hand onto the stone. It responded to her touch as the stone wall crumbled away before her. 
     “Be ready for anything.” she said and quickly ushered us in.
     The stone door reformed behind us locking us inside. I looked up at the awe inspiring building that took my breath away. The tall building was made entirely out of stone with balconies at every window. Each brick seemed to glow with its once sun kissed colour. It looked like an enchanted castle that belonged in a fairy tale. On the enchanted building it had four tall towers had tall spirals high up into the air. It made me dizzy just looking up at it. On this grey day, seeing this building was like a ray of hope. Rhea walked up the stone path that once looked like a garden but it was only now a shadow of its former self, overgrown, faded and grey. Nothing like the bright building that stood out amongst the drab dead garden.
     “Who lives here?” I asked.
     “You’ll see soon enough.” she said “But I don’t think she’ll be happy seeing me after all this time.”
      “Who’s is it Rhea?” Sophia sounded suspicious.
      She remained tight lipped on the subject. It wasn’t like Rhea to leave us in the dark.
     The four of us walked through the dead garden until we reached one of the solid wooden doors. We all stood still, wondering who would knock first. Then loud unlocking sounds came from behind the door and it opened welcoming us inside. Or at least I hoped. 
     Rhea turned to me and gripped both my shoulder and looked deep into my eyes.
     “Ellie, I need you more than ever. Will you stand by me whatever happens.” Rhea spoke in hushed tones.
     I had to think first. Why was Rhea telling me this, did she know what was going to happen?
      “Yes, of course.” I finally answered.
     Rhea smiled at me and walked through the open door. The rest of us followed inside. I stayed close to Rhea, hoping if things get too much we could make a quick exit. 
     Darkness had filled throughout building, I felt something from the shadows like a thousand eyes all watching me at once. There was nothing breath taking about the inside of the castle, it was run down with dust, destroyed paintings and cobwebs had made it its home. I would have thought it was abandoned if not for the mysterious person who let us in. There was no care put into it, unlike Rhea’s amazing house, all polished and pristine. Or what it used to be before I destroyed it. 
     An eerie glow appeared on the top of the balcony casting an ebbing light on all what the destroyed hall had to offer. The glow seemed to grow with each passing second as we all watched it descend in front of us. I took a step back as the radiant light transformed into a tall raven haired woman. She scanned the others and stopped onto Rhea. The raven haired woman’s face twisted with rage. She walked up to Rhea and slapped her across her perfect sculpted face. Sophia stepped forward but Rhea held her.
     “I didn’t expect to see you again.” The raven haired woman said.
     “We need your help, and I know I’m the last person who should ask for It.” asked Rhea.
     “So you come back begging for help. I don’t know if you’re worth my time.” The woman seemed to take joy in teasing Rhea.
     “Naaz, please do not do this.” Rhea added.
     “Is that anyway to talk to your dear long lost friend?” 
     “A lot has happened and we need your help.”
     “Yes, I have been watching you very closely, but I don’t know if I can trust you again.”
     The raven haired woman walked closer towards us and came into the dying light that was the sun. She too was a sight of beauty, soft dark skin that was flawless with dark cherry coloured lips. Her eyes were dark, but with a hit of redness thrown in and they seemed to hold a lot of history behind them. 
     “Don’t play games Naaz.” Rhea said.
     “I’m not doing anything, I’m just-..” The woman stopped mid sentence. “You!” Her eyes found mine and I felt terror rise inside my body like bile.
     “Siren’s are forbidden!” She said out loud. The dark haired woman threw out her hand and my body was dragged towards her. She lifted me in the air inches away from her face.
     “Do you think you can deceive me? I could smell her miles away, the stink is all over her.” She spat.
     “Rhea!” I called out for her help. 
     She did not look my way. She remained locked onto the dark beauty.
     Marcus rushed towards me but with a flick of the woman’s wrist he was sent spiraling off in the opposite direction.
     “Stop it!” I yelled.
     She ignored me and continued to address Rhea. 
     “Have you been naughty, Rhea? You know Siren’s are forbidden.” The woman giggled to herself and her eyes were truly terrifying. 
     She again waved her wrist and pain flooded through my body. My muscles sized up as the pain wormed its way throughout my body. I screamed out in agony while the woman laughed at my torment. I tried to fight through the pain as best I could but it was a losing battle. I wanted to call out to Rhea I didn’t have the energy.
     “That’s enough!” Rhea ordered.
     “Remember your place!” Naaz spat.
     Rhea gathered a light that slowly coiled around her hand.
     There was a look from Naaz that could turn you flesh into stone. She then released her hand and I fell to the floor. Marcus rushed towards me and bent down to pick me up but I filched away from him.
     “What is wrong with you?!” Marcus yelled at Naaz but she ignored him and continued her icy stare towards her old friend.
 Rhea stared down at me and I didn’t know what to say, I thought I could trust her but it was slowly fading away. Did she know this would happen?
     “You may stay a few days, no more, no less.” Naaz took one last look at me and walked away.
     I picked myself up, hoping there was no internal damage. Rhea then held out her hand and I paused for a few seconds before grabbing it. She helped me up and I felt her healing glow throughout my beaten body. Did she think that everything was ok? I get beaten while Rhea stands back, and then she rushes in like everything is ok? I found my trust in her being eroded away.
     I carried myself into the nearest room that luckily had a roaring fire. I lowered myself into the nearest chair that wasn’t filthy and curled up into a ball and felt like crying, but I held it in as best I could. 
     The group shuffled in after me and started to talk in hushed tones.
     “What the hell was that about?” whispered Marcus.
     “I’m sorry you all had to go through that. It’s me that she is after and she’s trying to do it through you.” Rhea explained.
     I wanted to ignore her words. I wanted to be alone.
     “Are we safe here?” Marcus asked.
     “Just leave it to me.” She replied.
     “But are we safe here?” Marcus asked again.
     “I hope so.” Rhea finally answered.
     “Are you ok Ellie?” Sophia sat down onto the carpet next to the sofa.
     “I’m fine.” I lied.
     “I’m sorry you had to go through that, if there’s anything you need or if you want a chat I’m here for you.” 
     I didn’t reply, I just wanted everything to stop and go back to my old life, where I got bullied for being different or worry about my English homework from Mr. Drop dead gorgeous. That was a walk in the park compared to this.
     I looked over at Marcus. He was too tense to sit, he just kept checking the windows for signs of trouble. 
     “Why did Naaz do that to me?” I finally asked.
     Rhea stood in the door with her back to us. She gave out a great sigh and turned to me.
     “She still harbors a lot of hate towards me and she can tell I care much for you.” she said.
     “Should I be worried about her? I don’t want to be watching my back all the time.”
     “No, Naaz is a loyal friend.” Rhea replied.
     “Loyal, you call that loyal?” I could tell Marcus was pissed. “She almost killed her.”
     “It was a test, Marcus. Please just calm down, we have been through a lot these past few hours. We should get some rest.”
     “I don’t think I can rest.” replied Marcus.
     I knew where he was coming from but my eyes burned with tiredness and with all the things we had seen today. I tried to block out all of the horrible images in my mind. The sofa was comfortable enough and I felt myself slip away.
     I was brought back to the darkest pits of the dungeons, locked away from the light. Leaches filtered in and out of the room to feed on me every day like I was their private buffet until I would pass out from the pain. That’s the life I led in my dreams. Broken and bruised, no one was coming for me and no one cared. I was alone and the only friend I had was the oncoming darkness. 

     I woke up sweating, body cold and clammy. Looking over, Marcus and Sophia were still asleep, but there was no sign of Rhea. I quietly crept out of the room and into the dark and dusty hall. I had a bad feeling about this place, darkness had taken up residence, and it wasn’t leaving anytime soon. Looking around the hall at night was terrifying, I felt like something would jump out and say “boo” but I ignored my childish thoughts and went on the lookout for Rhea. Something caught my eye at the corner of the dark long hall. 
     Rhea came out of the darkness as if she just said goodbye to an old friend. She didn’t notice me and I quickly hid myself behind a large broken statue that was chipped in many places. I watched her, she looked worried. Rhea was always calm and composed, but not here. This was a bad place and I didn’t want to stay.
     “You don’t have to hide from me Ellie.” Her voice was dull and dry.
     “Crap.” I whispered to the darkness.
     I move myself away from the busted out statue and slowly walked over to her. Rhea didn’t turn her back to greet me. She remained quiet while looking out of the window.
     “Cannot sleep?” she asked.
     “You could say that.” I mumbled.
     “Yes, it has been awful for you haven’t it.” Rhea said.
     “Yeah.” I answered dryly.
     “Ellie, I want to talk about what happened down in the sewers.”
     I didn’t know what Rhea was talking about until slowly I started to remember. “You’re talking about when I nearly had a breakdown?” 
     “Yes.” She answered.
     “I don’t know what happened, I felt as if I was back down in those dungeons again. I don’t ever want to go back there.”
     “I will not allow it, Ellie. But I am concerned about how this is talking its toll on you.” 
     I didn’t answer and I want to linger on the bad thoughts that held me back. Something inside me wanted to know what was going on, I wanted to blurt out everything that I was thinking but I held my tongue. “What’s going to happen to me?”
     Rhea didn’t react to the question; she continued to stare out of the window.
     “Rhea?” 
     She took a deep sigh and answered. “To be honest, I don’t know. After all that’s happened, I just don’t know anymore, I’m sorry to say but I don’t have all the answers yet.” 
     She had told me the honest truth. My confidence in Rhea was falling apart, slowly shattering into tiny pieces. “I don’t want this to be my life anymore; I don’t want to keep running all the time.”
     “We will find a way Ellie, I promise you.” Rhea turned to me and pulled me close to her.
     “Thank you, Rhea.”I squeezed her stone body tight, I felt safe when I was with Rhea, but was it all a lie? Was she the one dragging me into the danger? 
     “What’s inside that room you came out of?”
     I pulled away from her and waited for her response. “I was talking with Naaz, she knows everything. She has agreed to shelter us, but I don’t think we should outstay our welcome.”
     That was fine with me. I didn’t want to be here anymore then I had to.
     “Why did she hit you?” The words just fell out of my mouth and I immediately felt awful. “Rhea, I’m sorry.” I tried to apologize.
     “It’s ok Ellie. We used to be sisters, well more than that, but that was a long time ago. I was a different person back then, not what I am now.”
     “What happened between you?” I asked.
     “I felt I was going down the wrong path and it nearly destroyed me.” Rhea eyes turned glassy, she was reliving the memories of her haunted past.  
     “Does she hate you?” I asked.
     “I don’t know Ellie, but we have to be careful around her.” Rhea warned me.
     “Is she dangerous?” I asked.
     “She can be, but I will be watching her very closely.”
     Those words gave little comfort but I had no choice but to accept them.
     “Rhea, what happened at the underground bunker?” I asked.
     “I have failed them. They’ve just kept hitting us again and again. We are not ready for them.” she replied.
     “That’s what scares me the most.” I replied.
     “Me too, Ellie.” She continued to look out of the window as if she was watching someone’s movements.
     “I think I’m ready for bed now,” I said.
     “Yes, sleep well, and Ellie, thank you for talking with me.” I left her in the hall as I made my way back to the room with the spitting fire. Sophia and Marcus were still asleep, Sophia took the other broken sofa while Marcus laid on the floor among the many pillows. I quietly crept back to my spot and tried to go back to sleep.






Chapter Seven

     “Should we wake her?” someone whispered.
     Whispers awoke me from my sleep and I tried to block them out.
     I grunted my annoyance. 
     “No, leave her sleep, she’s been through enough.” another voice whispered.
     “Come on, I’m starving, hope she’s got some decent food.”
    Ah crap. My brain was now fully awake. I sniffed the many aromas that drifted around. It was food and it smelled great. I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes and stretched my aching muscles. Sophia and Marcus had gone and I jumped up from the sofa panicking. My heart started to thump hard inside my chest. Had they left me? Have they finally had enough? My tired legs rushed out into the hall only to hear voices. I followed them to a large kitchen, where everyone was eating and chatting away. 
     “Morning, Ellie.” said Marcus, as he tucked in to his plate of meat.
     Sophia was also there and sitting next to her was Rhea, but she wasn’t eating. The three of them sat around an old wooden table that had many scuffs and dents. 
     I took a spot next to Marcus who made enough room on the bench for me. On the table was a small banquet of meats, breads and fruits. Different kinds of jams and jugs of juice filled the table. I helped myself to some toast and a glass of fresh orange juice.
     “Where did this all come from?” I asked.
     “Naaz.” Rhea replied.
     “Finally, she has her uses.” added Marcus.
     “Did you all sleep well last night?” asked Rhea.
     There were grumbles coming from Sophia and Marcus, looks like they didn’t have the best night’s sleep either.
     I remained quiet. I didn’t want to tell the others that Rhea and I had a talk that night. I think I’d rather keep that between us.
     “So what is the plan then, Rhea?” Marcus asked with a mouth full of food.
     “I need to confirm a few things, and then we will have a proper chat about what is going to happen.” she replied.
     “Well something needs to be done, and we could really use your help Ellie.” said Sophia.
     I could feel everyone’s eyes on top of me, but I ignored them and started spreading some strawberry jam onto my toast. It felt ages since I had anything to eat, my stomach was completely empty, but with everything going on who could have an appetite after that? 
     “Did you get any sleep then, Rhea?” asked Marcus.
     “Yeah, I didn’t really see you around last night.” Sophia added.
     “I had to deal with a few things, plus I don’t sleep much these days.” 
     “So did you enjoy sleeping on the floor, Marcus?” I asked.
     “Wait, were you watching me while I slept?” he asked.
     His accusations made me choke on my toast. I coughed and quickly drank some orange just to try and clear it. I turned to him with flushed cheeks ready to defend myself.
     “I never watched you sleep, you were snoring.” I said.
     “Yeah, yeah, don’t try to deny it.” He laughed.
     The four of us continued the banter back and forth like it was an ordinary day, but it all stopped when Naaz entered the kitchen. Then there was silence. It was as if for a moment time had stopped on our little debate. She examined each and every one of us, but she took her time looking me up and down. I returned her icy glare with one of my own. 
     “Please continue.” she said.
     I watched her while she floated around the room. Naaz was beautiful, yet terrifying. She was someone not to mess with. We continued with our breakfast in silence, ignoring her presence.
     “How did you all sleep last night?” she asked cheerfully.
     No one replied.    
     “Naaz, we talked about this.” Rhea said.
     “I am just being polite.” The dark skinned woman said.
     “We really need to talk about Idina and her offspring.” Rhea told her.
     I looked up from my breakfast with interest.
     “Yes that creature has been birthing those disgusting things all over the place, and Barbus is using them like an army.” replied Naaz.
     With just hearing Barbus’s name made a chill run up my spine.
     “She needs to be stopped, if she dies, no more army for Barbus.” Rhea said.
     “I don’t think we are ready to jump back down there, not what happened last time.” Sophia said.
     “Quiet, the grown-ups are talking.” Naaz said spitefully.
     Sophia slammed down her hands on the table hard and walked out.
     “Sophia, wait.” Rhea rushed after her.
     A cruel smile appeared on Naaz’s lips.
     There were just three of us in the kitchen now, and it felt awkward. Marcus continued to attack his breakfast while I swallowed the last piece of toast along with a last mouthful of orange juice. I avoided her stare the best I could.
     “Is there something going on I don’t know about?” Naaz asked.
     Oh god she’s going to say something horrible. I prepared myself for her oncoming insults.
     “Are you two a couple?” She finally asked. 
     Marcus and I just looked at each other and I could feel my cheeks flushing with colour. “No, we’re not.” said Marcus.
     “What a shame. I could take him off your hands if you want.” she said seductively.
     Marcus snapped up from the dinner table and gave Naaz an evil look. “I will never be anyone’s plaything.” He said through gritted teeth. He stomped out of the kitchen leaving me with her.
     The encounter with Idina must have a lasting impact on him, I didn’t know that it bothered him that much. Now I was the only one left with Naaz. 
     “Do you enjoy pissing people off?” I asked after summing up the courage.
     Naaz disappeared from my sight and repapered right by my side. She snatched at my throat and lifted me up out of my seat. Her grip was tight and I remained still.
     “I had a Siren once, handy little thing she was. Maybe you could work for me?” she asked.
     “Let me go.” I tried to say.
     “Or I could just end it all for you? Would you like that? You would never have to watch your back again. You could be free.” She then brought me closer and whispered into my ear. “I could end you right now.”
     “Go ahead and try it.” I replied. 
     A deep fire took root behind Naaz’s eyes and she was about to unleash it onto me. She could have easily killed me if I stepped out of line and I think I just said “Screw the line.”
     Her grip tightened around my throat I fought against her strength. I could see the torment she brought me bring her some kind of twisted happiness. Something inside me snapped. I was sick of being the weak timid kitten. I used all the hatred I harbored deep down inside and screamed. Naaz lost her grip and she was thrown across the room smashing into the kitchen wall.
      I stood my ground, no way was I just going to stand there and let her hurt me again. Naaz picked herself up with a smile across her dark lips. With one raise hand the large wooden breakfast table took flight towards me. (Shit). My brain quickly tired to find an answer to the problem that came flying towards me. I screamed at the table, making it explode into tiny splinters. From the table fragments that showered around the room, Naaz quickly made her move. I didn’t have time to think and I paid for it. The air around me felt hot and exploded. I quickly made a dive for the floor, narrowly missing the blast by inches. 
     “What the hell is going on!?” demanded Rhea.
     I stood up and looked around, the kitchen was a disaster, many scorch marks stained the white walls and the doorway was blown wide open, scattering debris all around us.
     “Are you trying to kill her!?” Rhea yelled.
     “No, I wouldn’t call it that, it’s just we were sparing.” she replied.
     Rhea rushed towards me and made sure I wasn’t hurt.
     “I’m fine.” I said. 
      Naaz brushed herself off and walked towards me. “You’ve got some power little Siren, be careful who you use it on.” Naaz said as she left the kitchen.
     “Wow Ellie, you just took on a demi-god and survived.” Marcus said.
     I felt a rush of heat rush to my cheeks. 

     After that whole kitchen fight, I tried to keep my head down the best I could and avoid Naaz as best I could, I didn’t want another fight. I don’t think the building could take another beating. The group took up residence in the living room bit I decided not to follow them. I wanted to check out the place.
     “Ellie?” Rhea called.
     Oh crap. I turned and faced her like a child that was about to be caught doing something naughty.
     “What are you doing?” she asked.
     “I wanted to look around, I mean look at this place it’s like something out of a child’s story book.” I answered.
     “Fine, but if you see Naaz, keep on walking.” she said “and don’t touch anything.”
     I agree to her terms and went off to explore the unknown of Naaz’s home. I climbed the dust covered stairs to the top and carried on forward where I saw Naaz at the end of the hall for a brief second. 
     I was about to call out her name but Rhea’s words came into my mind at the worst time. I thought about going back down to the group, but I wanted to follow Naaz, it was like as if she was beckoning me to follow her. My instincts screamed at me to never go near that woman again, but something inside spurred me on. I chased after her through the hallway, passing me by one by one were portraits of unknown people. Within the frame, large scratch marks had ripped right through the delicate paintings. Who would do this? Finally continuing on, I came to a large glass door leading to the outside. 
     The door had many stained coloured pictures into the glass. Depicted onto it was a sea of bright red with a darkened figure at the top leading them against something else but the glass had broken, cutting off how the story ends. I ignored it and pushed through the stained glass doors and it lead me out into another dead garden. Brown was the dominant colour of the long deceased garden. As I walked down the stone stairs to get a look at the once majestic garden, something struck the side of the stairs, blasting smoke and stones up into the air. I slipped on the last step and landed onto my back. 
     “Slippery little thing aren’t you.” Naaz commented.
     I carefully picked myself up and saw Naaz standing in her now long dead jungle. 
    “What is wrong with you? Why are you trying to kill me all the time?” I asked.
     “You mistake me, little one. I’m trying to teach you.” Naaz replied.
     “You call that teaching!” I said pointing to the destroyed stairs.
     “If I am to help you, I want to make sure you know of your full abilities.” 
     Naaz raised her arm and I quickly dived across the garden, taking refuge behind a large stone fountain that held green mossy water. 
     “You cannot hide all your life, Ellie!” Naaz yelled.
     She’s right. I cannot hide from all my problems all my life. Naaz struck the fountain again and again tempting me to move. I quickly threw myself around the beaten up fountain and screamed, tearing up the concrete floor. I had surprised her, sending Naaz rolling up into the air and finally falling into a dead flower bed.
     “Sorry!” I yelled while trying to suppress a giggle.
     Within a blink of an eye, she was back up on her feet as if nothing has happened. She stared at me and smiled her frightening grin.
     “How was that?” I asked sarcastically.
     “Good, but I want you to do more.” She said.
     More? What more could I do?
     “I did tell you that I had a Siren? Yes?” she asked.
     “Yeah, you did, when you were trying to strangle me!” I replied.
     Naaz gave me a sly smile and ignored the comment. “Well, she used to do things for me. The little Siren would use her powers and lure many people here that we used.”
     I didn’t want to hear her talk anymore. 
     “That’s enough, I don’t want to know.” I said.
     “Fine with me, but Siren’s can influence without even touching, and that my dear I want you to do.” 
     “But I’ve never done anything like that before. How do I do it?” I asked.
     “Close your eyes and concentrate.” she said.
     I did as she said and closed my eyes. Did she want me to do anything else? I felt stupid, standing with my eyes shut tight.
     “Naaz?” I called out but she didn’t answer.
     Should I open them? 
     “Let go, what are you do-.” said a voice. “Ellie?”
     I opened my eyes up to see Marcus standing next to Naaz.
     “What are we doing out here?” he asked.
     “Training.” said Naaz. “Now, Ellie, make Marcus fall in love with you, while you are over there.”
     “Are you nuts?” Marcus yelled.
     “I’m not doing that!” I said.
     “You need to, you might need it one day.” she replied.
     “It could go wrong and I don’t want to hurt him.”
     “Look, she said she not doing it now can I go back inside.” he said.
     Naaz gripped his arm as he walked off. “Don’t you want to help Ellie?” she asked him.
     Marcus didn’t say anything, he looked at Naaz and then at me. “Fine.” he said.
     “Good.” Naaz smiled.
     “But what if it goes wrong and-.” she cut me off. 
     “It won’t, now close your eyes and try to call upon that power you have inside you.”
     I closed my eyes again and tried to call upon any power that I had inside me. Something pierced through the darkness of my mind and a figure of a man came towards me. It was Marcus, something wasn’t right with him. His eyes adopted a glassy stare and I didn’t like what I was seeing, I didn’t like seeing him like that. I wanted the image gone from my mind and quickly opened my eyes. Marcus was now standing arms length from me with the same stare I pictured in my mind. 
     “Mistress?” He said nonchalantly.
     He swayed on the spot, waiting for his commands. 
     “Turn him back, please Naaz.” I begged.
     She nodded and placed a hand to his chest, within a few minutes he blinked and returned to life.
     “I’m so sorry, Marcus.” I said.
     “It’s ok, I did it for you.” He said as he rubbed his forehead.
     “Are you ok?” I asked.
     “Just a little headache that’s all.” he replied.
     “I’m very impressed, Ellie.” said Naaz.
     “Thanks.” I mumbled to her. 
     Naaz disappeared back into the building leaving Marcus and I alone.
     “I’m sorry I did that to you.” I said.
     “I’m a little in awe and a bit scared of what you can do. When I was under it felt like I was trapped, my body was moving but I couldn’t stop it.” he said.
     “That’s horrible.” I said.
     “Yeah.” he replied.
     “I’m going back inside now.” I mumbled.
     “Come on, I’ll walk you back.” Marcus said.





Chapter Eight


     That afternoon we remained in the living room with the warm glow of the fire. The four of us remained silent as we sat. We were all lost, we were stuck. I couldn’t find a way out of this mess and everyone was looking to me because I was the ‘golden child’. Rhea was silent and not her usual self, she had her nose in that book that she brought along with her. I picked myself up from the floor and went over to Rhea, whose eyes were rapidly scanning each of the pages.
     “What are you reading?” I asked her.
     Rhea quickly snapped the book shut. “A very old story.” she replied.
     “I’ve seen that book before. You were reading it at your house.” I said.
     “You have quite the memory, Ellie. This is a very special book.”
     “What so special about it?” I sat down at her knee like a little child hoping for a bedtime story.
     “This book has no words.” she said. 
     I was confused, no words? “If it has no words, then how do you read it?” I confusedly asked.
     Rhea gave a little giggle. “No it doesn’t, but it is a very special book none the less. It lets you speak to very important people.” Rhea gently stroked the book as if a loveable pet.
     “Would I be able to talk to them?” whoever they are. 
     “Sorry, Ellie, it would destroy your mind. But hopefully, in time I can teach you.”
     “How?” I asked.
     “Touch the book.” Rhea passed the battered tome towards me and I could feel the power flowing into my body, quickening my heartbeat. It was something I had never felt before, not even when I touch Rhea for the first time. It made my entire body shiver with power. My body seemed to feed from it and I wanted more, but I quickly gave it back to Rhea.
     “Did you feel it?” she asked.
     “I’ve never felt that kind of power before.” I replied.
     “Not many people can stand its power, but this is what will end it all, Ellie.”
     “A book?” I asked doubtfully.
     “Yes.” Rhea replied.
     The book that she caressed in her lap didn’t look much, but whatever it was harnessed great power. “You think this book could stop everything that is happening?” I asked.
     “Yes, I’m sure of it.”
     Was I about to put all of my faith in a book? If Rhea held so much faith in one single tome then maybe I should too, but lately my trust in her was fading away but I had no choice but to trust her.
     “Rhea, will Naaz really help us?” I asked.
     “I hope she does, but she has held onto a lot of anger.” Rhea then let out a sigh.
     “Well, I hate to say it but she is powerful and we may need her.” I said. 
     “I’m surprised to hear you say that Ellie, since she has attacked you twice.” said Rhea.
     “I think that’s why we need her, because she’s dangerous. She can get things done.” 
     “Hopefully, she will help us in the end.” Rhea said.
     “Yes, but will she need a bit more convincing?” 
     “No, she doesn’t, but when it all comes down to it I hope she decides to stand with us.”
     “You’d think she’d betray us, even though she’s your friend?” I asked.
     “Well, friend is a bit of a stretch, but whatever we had between us, I hope that she still feels something for what we once had.” Rhea said.  
     There was odd silence between us. Something I couldn’t put my finger on, was Rhea judgment being clouded by Naaz. Since coming here she was not herself.
     Naaz then floated into the warm cozy room and eyed us. She then stopped at Rhea and jerked her head towards the door. Rhea agreed and walked out of the room with her. Sophia and I gave each other a, ‘what’s-going-on-look.’
     There was silence in the room. Marcus had decided to sit in the window again, watching the rain splatter on the rooftops, it seems he looked a bit hypnotized by it all. Sophia took a seat next to the glowing fire and I took an empty spot on the rug beside her. We both sat and stared into the spitting furnace. As I continued to stare, the flames seemed to dance endlessly inside the fireplace. We were captivated by its amber flames.   
     A few minutes past in pure silence, waiting for Rhea’s return.
     She came back into the room and ushered us to follow her. The three of us walked out of the warm room and out into the bitter coldness that was the dark hall. Naaz stood firmly in the middle of her cold dusty home. Her eyes locked onto mine as I walked closer. (Oh god what is she thinking now?) 
     “We need to act now. The leaches are running around killing innocent civilians and they will expose us if they continue.” Naaz’s voice was cold.
     “What can we do, we couldn’t even get close to her last time.” Marcus spoke.
     “True, but you didn’t have this.” Naaz pulled out a glass orb that swirled with a bright light in her hand. The radiant rays escaped the ball and headed straight into my chest. My body ebbed with a warm feeling, soon it started to spread throughout, tingling my fingers and toes.
     “What’s that?” asked Sophia.
     “This is called a wisp.” Naaz replied.
      “How did you get this?” Rhea was in awe.
     My head became fuzzy and heavy, the tingling sensation continued to spread and I felt fluffy and light. It wasn’t a horrible feeling, but a nice one. I felt calm, self confident and slowly I could feel my body rising up off the ground, or what it felt like it.
     “It’s just a glass orb, it doesn’t look like much.” said Marcus.
     Were they not seeing what I was seeing? The bright orb seemed to glow with a rhythm, like a heartbeat. Was this thing alive?
     “It’s part of her.” Naaz pointed at me and the gang turned towards me and their faces lit up.
     “Ellie, you’re glowing.” Sophia cried.
     “What?” I looked down at my hands. They were right, I was glowing as if someone had flipped a light switch on inside of me.
     Naaz took a step forward and placed the glass orb into my hand. As soon as my fingers touched the heavy glass, a fierce wind gathered around me, throwing my hair up into the calm storm. Everyone took a step back, hoping to avoid the power I commanded. The orb in my hands warmed my entire body, fueling me with energy I had never felt before, not even Rhea’s book felt like this. As I squeezed the orb tightly, more power flowed up through my hands. The wind then died around me and I was in amazement.
     “What the hell was that?” I asked.
     “That orb you hold in your hands is part of you, part of your history” Naaz explained. “It’s made with Siren magic, their blood.”
     “What!?” the room erupted into gasps.
     “Blood?” This thing I held in my hand was made from Siren blood?
     “Yes, Siren magic is very powerful, you’re handy little creatures when you want to be.” Naaz explained.
     I gave Naaz a disgruntled look and stared down at the orb.
     As I tightly gripped the orb with both hands, the warm power swirled around my fingers, until a warm wave pulsed around the room, engulfing us in its gentle glow, giving everyone’s skin a bright shine. 
     “Did everyone feel that just now?” Marcus asked.
     “I haven’t felt like that in years.” Rhea said.
     “Yeah, it was like a warm hug. Was that you, Ellie?” Sophia asked.
     I shrugged at the question. 
     “So will this help?” I asked.
     “Indeed it will. You will use it to fight off the darkness and keep away those foul leaches.” Rhea replied.
     “We need to go back in.” Naaz said.
     “Are you nuts? We almost died in there. Ellie almost didn’t make it.” Marcus said.
     “Marcus is right, Naaz, it’s too dangerous to go in there.” agreed Rhea.
     “It’s on council orders; you know their word is law.” Naaz answered.
     “The council?” Sophia asked. “That’s bad.”
    “Why?” I asked.
     “If the council says to do something you do it.” Marcus sighed.
     “Really?” 
     “Yep.” he replied.
     “We need to finish this then.” I said.
     “Are you sure?” Marcus asked.
     “I always thought that we’d have to go back in sooner than later, and I just want it over and done with.” I replied.
     “Ok.” Sophia added.
     “The council knows about your little Siren, Rhea. They are not happy that you deceived them.” Naaz’s cold words struck hard with her.
     “What have you done?! You told them about Ellie?” Rhea’s voice was rough and angry.
     “Do you think I did this on purpose? They feel you are not fit to conduct this mission.” Naaz answered.
     “So they asked you?!” Rhea asked
     “I’m the only one who can finish this, you had your chance. After this is done they want to see you.”
    Rhea paused and quietly thought to herself. “You have deliberately manipulated the situation for your selfish needs!” shouted Rhea.
     “You are still too young and inexperienced; I will be taking over and after all of this is finished, the council wants to meet the Siren.” Naaz looked in my direction.
     “Rhea?” I looked to her for answers.
     “We will sort everything out when we get back, don’t worry.” Rhea assured me.
     “Well, are we ready?” Naaz asked.
     “What, now?” 
     “It’s the perfect time, they won’t see it coming.” Naaz said.
     “As much as I hate to agree with Naaz, she’s right, it’s the perfect time.” Marcus agreed with her. 
     “Ellie, we have no choice.” Sophia sadly said.
     I nodded to them. That was the last place I wanted to go, I hated that place along with the creatures that inhabited the disgusting sewers. 
     I stood over next to Rhea and took hold of her hand. I stole a glance at her face, it was covered with worry and doubt. I had a feeling that things were not going to go well for any of us. The group formed a circle and I was lifted from the ground and thrown to our stomach churning destination. 
     We arrived in the dead of night, while the full moon shined down its white light on us. I expected to land at the same place where we escaped, but this place was new to me. I tried to look through the darkness but not even the moon’s light could penetrate its dark aura. Something evil had taken root here and we all knew what it was. I could almost reach out and touch it. 
     “This isn’t the place.” whispered Marcus.
     “They’ve moved around quickly and we were lucky just to learn of this location.” Naaz whispered back.
     While they whispered back and forth I felt the wisp in my cold hands glow with ebbing light, its gentle glow warmed my hands in the cold dark night. I could feel its warmth gentle embrace bring me a little comfort.
     “Rhea!” Sophia pointed towards something in the dark. “Something is moving out there.”
     We all looked at the spot Sophia pointed to in the dark, something was out there, moving.
     Rhea walked towards the darkness and stood there for a few minutes before waving her hand sending black ash up into the wind.
     “We must be close.” Rhea said as the ash flowed behind her.
     Naaz took off without warning down the hill and into the darkness that was night.
     “Shouldn’t we stick together?” asked Sophia.
     “She’s going to get herself killed.” Marcus whispered.
     We all followed Naaz down the muddy hill and found a worn out sewer gate. Naaz snatched at the gate and threw it to one side with ease. She was the first to enter the darkness, leaving the rest of us out in the cold. 
     “Ellie, are you ready?” asked Rhea.
     I swallowed a hard lump in my throat and answered. “Yes.”
     I followed behind Rhea into the tunnel. The memories came flooding back of the creatures and the failed assassination of the snake woman. There was no going back this time, we had to finish this or we would die or worse, chained up to a wall and left to die. 
     I cannot believe I was down here again, I hope this time it was worth it.
     The orb in my hands lit up the bleak red stained tunnels. All the horrors of the sewers were on display for all to see. Scratch marks covered the walls along with unknown stains. Bloody hand prints were dotted all around. What had happened here? I carefully made my way through the massive amount of slime that covered along the tunnel floor. Naaz didn’t wait for us. She had rushed through the maze of tunnels as if she knew the way.
     “Can someone tell her to slow down?” I asked.
     “She’s going to get us all killed.” whispered Marcus.
     Rhea ignored our pleas and carried on through the rusty tunnel.
     We turned a corner that led deeper into the system of tunnels. We were now ankle deep into the murky water again. My shoes were soaking and I could feel the water slowly filling them up. 
     “No this again, that’s two pairs of shoes you owe me now.” whispered Sophia.
     “Don’t worry, I’ll buy you any amount of shoes, now get going.” Rhea replied.
     “Those were good shoes too.” I added.
     Rhea shushed us and we all stopped. She turned to me and pointed at the glowing orb in my hands.
     Now was the time, I held the ball up into the air hoping it would work (come on work). We all had our hopes resting on this one glass paperweight. Marcus took a space next to me and readied his sword. Shuffling noises echoed down the tunnel, my guess was that there were a few leaches around the conner. Rhea stepped forward and caught their attention, they hissed and charged at us.
     “Now, Ellie.” Rhea yelled.
     As if the orb knew what to do, it started to pulse a light around the tunnel. The leaches screamed and scampered away from the light as it burned their skin.
     “It’s working!” Sophia yelled.
     “The light will always banish the darkness.” said Rhea.
     “Wow, I cannot believe it actually worked.” I looked down at the glass orb as its light retreated back into its self as if sleeping.
     “It’s all down to you now, Ellie.” Marcus said.
     I turned to him with glowing cheeks.
     We continued down the dirty tunnels after Naaz. Where the hell was she? 
     Doubts entered my mind and I tried to get rid of them, but when everyone is counting on you, it’s hard not to be filled with dread. I would try get rid of one, then another would appear to take its place. My head was just going round in circles and I hated it.
     “Do you think we’ll fail again?” I asked Marcus.
     “I hope not, I don’t think we’ll get another chance again.” he replied.
     “We have Rhea and Naaz here this time, so I feel a little bit safe.” 
     “I’m not too sure about her though, she seems devious to me, look at what she did to you.” Marcus said.
     Marcus had brought back one of my memories. The pain, that’s all I could, and would remember. Her sadistic smile would haunt me forever.
     “I know, I know. I hate to say it, but for now we need her.”
     “Yeah I guess you’re right, but I’ll still keep an eye on her, for you.”
     “Thanks.” I shyly said.
     From the corner of my eye I could feel Marcus’s eyes glued to me, what was he looking at?
     “Let’s just get this over with.” I whispered to him.
     Loud voices swept through the tunnels, we were getting close. The nerves had kicked in and I tried to calm myself. The orb in my hand could almost feel my nerves and it pulsated its warm glow through my body, energizing it.
      Rhea listened to the voices and without warning pulled away from the group leaving the three of us hanging back. 
     “Rhea?” I whispered.
     She held out her hand and stopped us, we stood our ground and she disappeared around the corner. The voice’s soon acknowledged Rhea’s presence and began to talk like old friends.
Chapter Nine


     My heart started to pound in my chest, and with being so close to Marcus didn’t help ether, both of us covered in sweat. Marcus was tightly wound and he was ready to charge in at any moment. Sophia’s face had many mud streaks across her face with sweat beading onto her forehead, we were all tired and worn out, and I was not cut out for this. I belonged in a world where I was in school dreading about failing my exams not worrying about monsters trying to kill me. 
     We all tried to listen in on the conversation, but sadly there was nothing to learn.  
     “Should we charge in or something?” I asked nervously.
     “I don’t think that’s a good idea, Rhea can handle it.” replied Sophia.
     “Maybe we should charge in.” said Marcus.
     The voices were getting louder and I think they were arguing about something. I had to do something. I stepped away from the wall and sprinted after Rhea. I tried to ignore Marcus and Sophia calling me back, but I wanted to finish this, no I needed to finish it. I quickly stopped myself when I saw the large serpent woman again. Her eyes opened with shock and bewilderment.
     “So you’ve finally brought her to me to make up for your passed mistake?” her voice seemed to have harshness to it.
     “This is Ellie.” spoke Naaz.
     “Yes, the Siren, we’ve met before.” It said.
     Rhea quickly put herself in-between the creature and I.
     Before I could speak or try to. Loud footsteps pounded the floor behind me. Marcus came to my side with his sword raised. The snake woman quickly slithered up to her perch on higher ground.
     “Lie’s, it’s nothing but lies.” The creature screamed. “Come to me my children.” 
     Shrill screams and loud wailing came from every direction and every entrance, leaches came flooding in to protect their mother. 
     “Ellie, now!” shouted Rhea.
     I knew what to do. With both hands I clasped the orb and tried to channel my power. I thought back to when I could burst with energy. I let it grow and fester until I was ready to release it. The heat intensified around me, I was ready to explode.
     Around me I could hear screams and whizzing noises fly past. Rhea was shouting orders to the others, making sure that I was protected. My body tingled all over until I could not stand it anymore. I opened my eyes and let out a wave of power. It traveled away from the orb, making its way to each of the leaches, blackening their skin before finally, turning them into ash on the spot. Some of them tried to escape but they were consumed by the white wave. 
     “No! My babies!” screamed Idina.
     The snake woman tried to make her escape but Naaz lifted up her arm and darkness snaked from her fingertips. The dark energy found it target and slashed at Idina’s bare flesh many times causing her to flail and fall to the floor in pain.
     Her skin had deep gashes with crimson blood trickling from the many wounds. She laid on the floor screaming and writhing in agony as Naaz’s power repeatedly cut deep into her skin.
     “Stop it!” I screamed.
     Naaz turned to me, her face was full of glee. She enjoyed the pain she inflicted.
     “She needs to die.” Naaz said through gritted teeth.
     “Not like this, this is torture.” Naaz dismissed the darkness and turned to me, Idina made her move she saw her chance and quickly sprung towards me. Her strong hand snatched at my throat and lifted me up into the air, leaving me gasping for breath.
       “No!” Marcus charged forward but with one flick of her large tail, he was sent hurtling towards the wall.
     Rhea was about to do something with her hands but she stopped when Idina increased her grip onto my throat.
    “Let her go!” shouted Rhea.
     “Come any closer and I’ll snap your pretty pet’s neck.” It spat. 
     I gripped onto her strong arm to see if I could influence her. Her skin was dead cold and I could feel my body vibrate with her power. I closed my eyes and tried to go deeper. Her hate for Rhea and Naaz was unimaginable. It was so strong, I could almost feel myself growing mad. I delved deeper into her memories. Something was calling to me, asking me to dive into the many memories that lay before me.
      Idina was once mortal. I could see into her memories living a normal life with her friends and her sister, a Siren. They were close and she did everything for her younger sister. I tried to learn more but something fought against my control, something that she didn’t want me to see. Naaz’s face appeared inside her mind with her signature sick smile. 
     “Yes, Siren, look at what your so-called protectors did to an innocent young girl.” 
    Idina opened up more of her memories to me and Rhea and Naaz were at the root of it all, all that anger and rage, they were the reason. They had turned her into the monster, that same monster that had a tight grip onto my throat. I was then pulled out of the memories and back into the dark tunnels with Idina still gripping onto my throat. Her eyes were cold, lacking any sympathy.
     “You see Siren, that’s what they are. They are the real monsters. I tried to protect her from them. They used her and that’s what they’ll do to you!” She gripped my throat even tighter and I could feel myself slipping away.
     I tried to control her but my strength slowly drained away.
     “Let her go!” Rhea ordered.
     The creature then paused for a moment. “If I devour your little pet Siren I….” A loud whizzing noise shot towards us, and exploded on impact cutting off her words. Idina lost her grip and I was thrown away from her. The once mortal girl cried out in pain. Naaz and Rhea stood over her, watching while Idina struggled for her last breaths. 
     “Just do it. There’s nothing else you can do to me!” Idina said.
     I picked myself up, and pain stabbed at me. I watched in horror as Rhea and Naaz moved in on their kill. “No!” I shouted but my words went unheeded.
     Naaz stepped forward and with a swift motion of her hand, Idina was dead. Blood seeped from dying corpse and into the ground.
      I had seen what they had done to her, they were the monsters not her. Idina was just trying to protect her sister and got turned into a monster because of it. I remained on the cold floor trying to come to terms with everything I had just witnessed. 
     “Let’s go.” ordered Naaz.
     Rage fueled me. The orb I reclaimed in my hand became hotter and I gripped it tightly until it burned. She doesn’t even care, neither does Rhea. Without saying a word to anyone, we found our way back through the tunnels. There was no joy to be had from this, even if the threat was gone from my life I would always remember. There we no leaches left to hinder our escape, had I done the right thing? Were we the bad guys? I tried to ignore the nagging questions and continued up with the rest back up to the surface, my rage still bubbling away until I felt I could explode.
     Fresh air hit me like and I welcomed it. I took a deep breath to try and calm myself but it didn’t work. My mind bouncing with questions that I needed answers to. I needed to say something.
     “So that was your dark past you were talking about?” I asked.
     Everyone stopped and looked at me.
     “Yes, Ellie and I am not proud of it.” Rhea replied.
     “But she is!” I pointed at Naaz.
     Naaz replied with a sick smile.
     “Why did you do that to an innocent girl, she was just trying to save her sister.” 
     “What?!” Marcus looked confused.
     “Rhea?” Sophia said confusedly.
     “I saw her memories, she was just an innocent scared girl!” my voice started to grow hoarse. 
     “She was far from innocent as you say, she was going to the council about my Siren.” Naaz said.
     “So that’s it? You were scared of your toys being taken away, you disgust me!” I yelled.
     My anger seemed to guide my words, anything that came to mind was thrown from my mouth.
     “Watch your words, child.” she warned.
     “Or what you’ll try to kill me again?” 
     “Try! If you want to die, just say the word?”
     “Naaz, you touch her and you’ll have me to deal with!” Rhea said.
     “Uh Ellie, the orb, it’s getting brighter.” Marcus said.
     I looked down at the glowing ball, it was glowing an angry red and I could feel the heat growing stronger from it but my anger blocked it out.
     Rhea turned back to me, she tried to calm down the situation.
     “Ellie please understand, that’s not who I am anymore.” 
     “She’s changed now Ellie, she’s good.” Sophia said.
     My anger was now redirected. “What would you know, you just follow whatever she says, for all I know you could have been by her side when she did it!”
     “That’s lies and you know it is, she has changed and I know she feels guilty for even doing it!”
     “You’re lying!” I yelled.
     “Ellie, that’s enough!” Marcus said.
     “You can shut it, always following Ellie like a love sick puppy, you make me sick!” Sophia was now caught up with my anger.
     “Now that’s enough!” Rhea asked for peace but she wasn’t getting it.
     “This is all your fault, you dragged me into this. I didn’t ask for any of this crap!” 
     “I saved you from those leaches and you were in danger and still are.” She said.
     “I bet you sent those leaches after me, just so you could save the day!” I said.
     “Lies, I saved you.” Rhea replied.
     “So you keep saying, but I bet you just wanted a Siren all for yourself, is that what I am to you people, a prize to be won?” I yelled.
     “Prize! You think so highly of yourself don’t you?” Naaz added.
     “That’s enough!” Rhea yelled.
     I could trust no one anymore, they were all against me. Using me for their own selfish needs. The orb in my hands burned with heat, my hatred was feeding the orb. I screamed in pain and dropped down to my knees. The orb was slowly burning into my flesh.
     “Drop it, Ellie!” Rhea called out. 
     I couldn’t it let go. The heat flowed inside my body and made my blood boil. The orb released a wave of power that sent the others flying off their feet. The fierce wind was back and I was in the eye of the storm. I was trapped while the orb burned into my skin. Horrible voices screamed at me from the orb, telling me that I had killed them. The voices picked up and more screaming pierced my ears. The screams now mimicked each other. 
     “Stop it, stop it!” I screamed.
     The wind grew faster around me and I was scared. “R-rhea!” I tried to shout.
     The voice gathered in the air and screamed with their wailing voices. The orb grew uncontrollably hot and shattered in my hands releasing more tortured cries for help. The tiny white orbs of light flew into the air and circled around me with the wind while still calling for help.
     Rhea scrambled to her feet. “Ellie!” she screamed.
     “It’s the Sirens, they’ve escaped!” Naaz called out.
     Rhea brought her hand forward and tried to blast it with her own light but the wailing barrier of Sirens absorbed Rhea’s failed attack.
     “Protect the Siren, protect her.” The words of the souls echoed each other.
     The screaming had stopped, but the wind around began to pick up speed, and a blur of white had surrounded me. The bright balls of light had stopped in mid-air, one at a time they came closer towards me and I tried to bat them away but my hand would go straight through them. 
     “We have to do something!” Marcus tried to say over the wailing winds.
     Each orb passed into my body and I felt the agony and the pain that they felt while living. Each filled with a soul, giving me feelings of doubt, anger, doubt, fear, and sorrow. Their own memories blurred into one and I could not tell between mine and theirs.  I could not take the pain anymore, I screamed out and the wind around me disappeared. I could feel the souls each fighting for the right to control my body and I was fighting back, but they were slowly winning.
     “No! Get out!” I screamed.
     The others rushed towards me and I shouted for them to get back. I could not hold it in any longer. Someone was controlling my body. It was like I was watching a different person and not myself.
     Rhea slowly walked towards me and I screamed inside for them to run.
     “Protect the Siren.” The voices screamed.
     Someone made my hands move and a bright light escaped, and knocked Rhea high into the air. 
     “Stop it.” I screamed inside my head. “Leave her alone.”
     “Rhea!” yelled Sophia.
     Naaz was about to move but my body was quicker to react. Another bright light came from my hands and exploded. Naaz was sent spiraling through the air and landed hard on her back along with Rhea.
     “Stop it, Ellie!” shouted Marcus. 
     My head turned into the direction of Sophia and Marcus, they showed true fear across their faces. They stood together, hoping to stand their ground against me.
     “Bow before us.” The voices said.
     “Stop this!” Sophia yelled.
     “If you do not bow, then you will join them.” The words came out of my mouth but they were not mine.
     Sophia quickly put up her barrier, protecting Marcus and herself. Both of my hands were forced out. Jets of blinding light were sent forth towards Sophia’s barrier, the wave of light covered over her barrier hoping to find a way in. Something inside me laughed as I watched her struggle against the power. I could see Sophia battle against the tide but I was powerless to do anything but watch. Within seconds her barrier soon shattered around her, leaving Sophia and Marcus defenseless. She stood there with her face full of horror. Marcus quickly placed himself in front of Sophia, baring my path. 
     “No not them!” I screamed. I fought for control for my own body but they weren’t letting go. Each of the sirens wanted a turn at my body like I was a brand new toy for them to play with. I fought against each of them and I could feel their influence disappearing. Sophia took her chance and ran towards Rhea along with Marcus. 
     I screamed and the ground cracked around me. My body began to tremble from the force of the scream, I kept on going and I could feel their grip fading away. My vision had grown darker and my head felt heavy but I had to keep going. One at a time the souls drifted away from my body, I had won. I inhaled deeply, I had finally had control of my body. The scream had drained me of all of my strength and I could feel my body falling to the floor.





Chapter Ten

    Dense fog had surrounded me. Did the other leave me here? My body didn’t feel right, even after I fought for control of it, it just didn’t feel like it belonged to me. Soft voices echoed around me, it was a nice change from the other voices that screamed at me. Still laying on the ground floor, I picked myself up with difficulty. All of my muscles ached with pain, I just felt devoid of strength.
     “Am I dead?” I blurted out.
But this doesn’t look like heaven or anyone’s concept of it. Just lots of fog and empty vast of nothingness. There were no pearly gates, no fluffy clouds or anyone to show you where you will be staying for the rest of your undead life. I started to walk about, looking for anything that was worth noticing.
     “Hello!” I called out nervously.
    Something appeared in front of me that made me jump back. The fog around me gathered and I watched in awe as something started to take shape, it seemed to be of a human and it was slowly coming together piece by piece.
     I took a few steps back, not knowing if it was friend of foe. The white fog ended with a glittering glow and out stepped a tall man, he was half naked from the waist up, his strong body showcased how muscular his arms and chest were. He looked like he could take on a thousand men. His piercing hazel eyes watched me as I took him in. He walked slowly towards me and I felt like running it the opposite direction.
     “Hello.” He said. His voice, soft and gentle, nothing what I thought it would be.
     “Uh, hello.” I said nervously. “Am I dead? Are you here to take me away.”
     The tall bald man laughed to himself. “No dear Siren, I just want to talk.”
     “Jeez, why does everyone kidnap me and want to talk, I’m sick of it.”
     “I didn’t kidnap you, you brought yourself here.”
     “Wait, I brought myself here?” I asked confusedly.
     He nodded.
     “Well, that’s something new.” I mumbled.
     “I want to talk about, Rhea and Naaz. Do you think you should be with them?”
     “Why what’s it to you?” I am sick of people telling me what to do.
     “That’s quite the attitude you’ve got there.” He said.
     “Sorry, it’s been a rough couple of days.”
     “I can see that.” The tall man replied. 
     “What do you mean? Have you been watching me?”
     “I am just an observer, nothing more.” He answered.
     “So you have been watching me?” I asked again.
     He didn’t say anything, I just watched him as he just stood there. What the hell was he?
     “Ellie?” he said.
     “Yeah, hold on, I’m thinking.” I replied.
     “There are people out there who want you to succeed and some want you to fail, I’m just here telling you your options.”
     “What are you talking about?”
     “Well, there are people out there, who want you dead, and some think that being with them two won’t end well.”
     “I make my own decisions and I do feel safe with Rhea, not so much with Naaz though.” I said to him.
     “There is still darkness inside that one, watch what you do around her.”
     “Who, Naaz?” I asked.
     “No, Rhea. She might say she is a new person but she hides a dark secret that still haunts her to this very day.”
     “Are you talking about Idina?” I asked.
     “No, there is something far more worse she hides and it has taken hold of her.” He said. 
     “She would never hurt me, she protects me.” I told him
     “There will come a time when no one can help you.”
     His words shook me, I would never be alone again. “Is that a threat?” 
     “No, just a warning.”
     It was my turn to ask questions.
     “What are you? Why am I here? And who the hell wants me to succeed, succeed at what?” 
     The blue eyed man laughed and his strong shoulders jumped up and down. “Well, I am sort of an observer, I am neither good nor evil, and second, you are in the nether. A place between worlds and finally, the people who want you to succeed are unknown to me, sadly.” 
     “Well that was a mouthful, thanks. At least you were honest with me, unlike some people they just skate around the facts.” I said.
     “You are playing a dangerous game, Ellie, think of who you are creating ties with, be careful. There are people who want you to be safe including one special person.” His voice softly said.
     My heart skipped a beat. “Kate?!” I asked with tears forming in my eyes.
     He didn’t reply but I knew it could be her. “Be careful.” He stood back away from me and something expanded from his back up into the air. Two large grey wings were thrown up into the air ready to soar into the graying fog. He gave me a quick smile and shot off into the unknown. Before I could think of how to get back, I found myself falling through the air and back down to my body.  

     I opened my eyes to see bodies bent over me.
     “She’s awake.” said a familiar voice.
     “Let her have some space.” another said.
     Their face’s moved from my view and the bright new sun showered its blinding light upon me. I laid there for a moment just staring at the sky, stunned at what I just saw up there. Or was it down below? Whatever he was, I didn’t know whether to trust him or not. The group of people who I could trust was getting smaller and smaller.  
     I sat up and I felt like a house had fallen onto me, I felt like crap, worse that crap. Many hands offered me their help but I ignored them and got to my feet myself. My legs wobbled underneath me, but I held my ground.
     We were still by the sewer where we escaped from. They hadn’t moved me. They probably didn’t want to touch me.
     “Are you ok?” Sophia asked.
     I looked around to see the others had worried looks on their faces, all except Naaz. Her face, frozen with a scorned look.
     “She may still be possessed.” said Naaz.
     “Knock it off Naaz. You’re just pissed cos’ Ellie knocked you on your ass’.” Marcus said.
     Naaz gave him a frightening look and turned her back on us. 
     “Yeah, I’m fine. I’m sorry I said those horrible things before.” I crocked. My throat felt tight and sore.
     “We all said horrible things to each other, it wasn’t us, it was that orb.” Sophia said.
     I looked down at my hands and the burnt flesh was healed.
     The others agreed with her. “What did happen anyway?” I asked.
     Rhea took a deep breath and explained. “Well Ellie, your emotions connected with the wisp and it started a chain reaction; it made everyone feel angry because they were in fact, feeling your emotions.”
     “How?” I asked.
     “Well, it was the orb. It intensified your anger and the orb could not handle that sort of power, so it overloaded, making it shatter.” Rhea said. 
     “So those things inside were-.” Sophia was cut off.
     “Those, my dear, were dead Siren souls.” Naaz interrupted.
     I knew what she said was true, when they were inside I could feel each and every one’s pain and torment that they felt in life. Their strong will nearly took over my body.
     “It felt horrible, I thought I was going to mad with their anger.” I said.
     “Well it’s over now.” Marcus said.
     “But, what I want to know is why were they protecting Ellie?” Sophia asked with a puzzled look on her face.
     “They thought we were a threat.” Naaz explained. “Especially, Rhea and I.” 
     “Why did they think you would harm me?” I asked them.
     Rhea was about to answer but Naaz gripped onto her hand hard and spoke for her. “I don’t know, but it worries me.” she replied.
     I noticed the silent words that Rhea and Naaz exchanged with just a look. What are they not telling me? I want answers. 
    “Anyway, let’s get back, before something else happens.” advised Marcus.
     We all agreed and grabbed onto Rhea and Naaz’s hands. The same feeling came over me and my stomach knotted inside. Shapes and colours flashed passed my face as we headed back to Naaz’s dark home.   
     We landed in the cold hall with the others. I was too tired to talk so I abandoned them at the hall and I made my way into the fiery cozy living room. I found my comfy sofa and got comfortable. I didn’t want to talk to anyone, not with everything that had happened. How could they ever treat me the same again after what I had done. If I was them I wouldn’t even go near me again, but that wasn’t me. I would never intend to hurt them, but did they know that? The fear I saw in Sophia’s eyes, I will never forget that as long as I live and I wish never witness it ever again.
     The words of the hazel eyed angel echoed inside me. I would have to be careful around the others. I don’t want to end up on my own again, not like last time. His warning about Rhea threw me off. I trusted her the most, but he’s right, there is darkness inside her, and sometimes there are little moments when I can see it. I don’t want to be here when she finally decides to give in to it.


Chapter Eleven 

I woke up to chattering voices coming from outside the door. The voices were of those that I knew. I quietly made my way towards the door to have a peek. They were all in the hall talking to one another in hushed tones. I pulled the door open to have a better listen.
     “I’m getting worried about her powers.” Sophia said.
     “I know what you mean, she’s growing stronger every day, and no one would have been able to come back from that.” Rhea agreed.
     “She was possessed by multiple spirits all at once, and she comes out unharmed? I don’t know even if I could come back from that.” Naaz said.
     “Can we stop talking about Ellie like she’s a danger to us, she’s not.” Marcus said.
     My heart skipped a beat when I heard Marcus trying to defend me, but at the same time it scared me. Why would I need defending, was I a lost cause, an evil villain to be disposed of?
     “I know what you are saying Marcus, I would never abandon her, no matter what happens.” Rhea explained “but her powers are growing too fast, and she might not be able to handle them.”
      “I would never leave her.” Marcus added.
     “We all know that.” added Naaz.
     “No one is leaving anyone.” Rhea said.
     “What do you think the council will do to her?” Sophia asked.
     “I don’t know. We haven’t had a Siren out in the open for a long time.” Rhea replied.
     “I won’t let them take her away!” Marcus harshly said.
     “Keep your voice down. No one will take her and I will make sure they don’t get a chance.” 
     “You’re quite keen on her aren’t you?” asked Naaz.
     Marcus remained quite.  
       The four of them stood in silence, I decided to join them. I opened the door and pretended to rub the sleep out of my eyes. They saw me and greeted me with fake smiles.
     “You’re awake.” Rhea said.
     “Yeah, I just needed some rest.” I answered.
     Rhea rushed towards me and pulled me into a tight embrace. I felt so safe in her arms, I could feel all my troubles falling away, but the angel’s words popped into my head at the worse time. She has darkness inside her. I tried to wash the tainted words from my mind.
     Marcus stepped forward and greeted me with one of his smiles.
     “I’m glad you’re safe.” He softly said.
      “Thanks.” I replied.
     Naaz cleared her throat to interrupt us. “There is a matter of the Siren souls.”
     I stared at Naaz confused. “What, those white things?” 
     “Yes, since you released them. They will be looking for fresh hosts.” replied Naaz.
     “And I guess that’s not a good a good thing.” I asked.
     “No, not really, Ellie. They are full of hate and they can hurt people.” 
     “Wait, wait.” I held up my hands and stopped everyone “you mean they are out there on the lose?”
     “Well, yes and you freed them.” Naaz said.
     “But why were they in there? It’s not like they volunteered for it. When they were inside me I could feel their lust for life. They died an unnatural death, there was a lot of hate inside them.” 
     Rhea looked uncomfortable with the question I posed to her. “Well?” I waited for their answer.
     Naaz stepped forward and shared the answer. “Those Sirens were hunted down and killed for their souls.” She said nonchalantly.
     Did you know about this?” I asked while trying to remain calm.
     I didn’t need an answer from Rhea, it was written across her face.
     “And I used that thing, without knowing, I’m just as bad as the person who made it.” I could feel my voice breaking.
     Then something rushed into my mind and I felt sick. “Did you make it?” I asked Naaz.
     Naaz smiled her signature sick grin. “It’s something I would do, but I didn’t, it was a gift from an admirer.” She said.
     “You’re lying!” I shouted. 
     “That’s enough!” Rhea called out.
     I felt the rage bubble inside me and I tried to calm it.
     Marcus stepped in between us. “It’s getting late and we have been through enough today, and we have a long day ahead of us tomorrow, so let’s get some rest.” 
     “Sounds like a good idea to me.” said Sophia.
     I didn’t want to talk anymore; I just walked back to the room with a sick feeling inside my stomach.  
     
     I tried to sleep, but my mind was in overdrive. It kept on replying events around and around inside my head and I couldn’t take it anymore. Everything was so messed up. I got off the sofa and I noticed that Sophia was sitting close to the fire, staring at the fireplace. Sophia was unknown to her surroundings and I didn’t want to intrude on her. I quietly tired to make my way out of the room.
     “You can stay if you want.” Sophia’s child like voice said.
     I jumped when she spoke.
     “I don’t want to interrupt you or anything.” I whispered.
     “No it’s ok, I was just thinking, that all.” She replied.
     I took a seat next to her on the thin threadbare carpet. The heat of the fire felt good against my cold skin. Sophia was silent but I could tell she wanted to talk about something. 
     “Is there something wrong?” I asked.
     “You can tell?” she said.
     “Well it’s not that hard, when you got that look on your face.”
     “It’s just everything is just getting out of hand.” she said.
     “I know what you mean, it’s getting hard but we have to push through.” I replied.
     “I don’t know why I’m having a hard time it’s you who’s in the middle of it all.” Sophia said. 
     “I sometimes have days when I just want to say, ‘to hell with it’ but I don’t because I know I’ll never see you or Rhea again.” I tried to give Sophia a supporting smile. These words I spoke to Sophia, I didn’t know whether or not I believed them, but something inside me screamed for me to keep going and never look back, but could I really do that?
     “What about Marcus?” she asked.
     “What about him?” I tried to ask nonchalantly.
     “Would you miss him?” she asked.
     I tried to find the words but my brain failed me.
     “I see the looks you give him.” Sophia commented.
     “No, I do not.” I replied.
     “He’s really interested in you.”
     “Well it’s his job, he has to be interested.”
     “But some of the looks he’s given you.” Sophia fanned herself.
     My cheeks started to flare.” Really?” 
     “Ha, so you do like him then?” she said with a giggle.
     “Yeah, he’s ok, but I don’t think its right, I mean look at what we are dealing with?”
     Behind us Marcus gave a little snore and Sophia and I started giggling like two school girls.
     “That’s why you’re much stronger then I am, Ellie.”
     “No, not really, I’m just trying to deal like everyone else. We all have our ways of coping with things.” I said.
     “Yeah, I’m just hoping that the council will help us.” Sophia brought her knees up to her chest and hugged herself.
     “I am nervous about it, do you know what they are like?” I asked.
     “Everyone has their own view on them, I haven’t had any dealings with them and hope not to either.” Sophia regretted her words as soon as they left her pink lips.
     “I’m sorry, it just-.” She tried to apologies.
     “No, it’s ok.” I replied.
     I felt a chill come over me and I shuffled myself closer to the fire.
     There was another odd silence between us. 
     “Ellie, what happened to your mother?” Her words took me aback. “Rhea has told me a few things but nothing else. I hope I’m not being nosey.”
     I didn’t really know how to answer her question, no one had ever really asked before. Not even I know what happened to my mother, I was too young at the time but my Dad had said that she had died of an illness. I didn’t ask questions at the time nor did I want to, we just never talked about it. It was a sore subject and nether one of us wanted to upset the other. I took a deep breath and answered her.
     “She died when I was very young, I don’t even remember what she looked like since there are not many pictures in the house. I think my Dad just couldn’t bear seeing pictures of her, It was really hard for him.” My stomach tightly knotted itself and I felt sick. Guilt flooded in like a burst dam. I tried to hold back the tears.
     “Don’t worry, Ellie. You’ll see your Dad again.” Sophia could see how upset I was.
     “Yeah, I hope.” I whispered. “I just miss him so much, but what I’m doing is good for him, otherwise I would be putting him in danger.” Those words I spoke over and over again gave little comfort. Was I doing the right thing?
     “So what do you think of Naaz then?” Sophia quickly threw the question at me.
     “Well, I know that you hate her.” I said.
     “With good reason!” Sophia replied “look at what she did to you.”
     “I know, but there’s something about her, but I cannot put my finger on it.”
     “That she’s evil, that’s what.”
     “Well there is that, but it’s something about her that just feels wrong.”
     “I think we should stay away from her.” Sophia said.
     “You don’t like it, because she an old friend of Rhea’s.” I said.
     “That’s not it.” She quickly said.
     I just stared at her with two raised eyebrows. 
     “Fine. But there is something about her though.” Sophia said.
     “Agreed, but for now we are under her roof and I don’t want to do anything that could upset her right now.” I looked at the room around me, I could hardly call this a stable living area but for now it would do. It was better than living in a dark pit for two weeks.
     “I think we should call it a night, we’ve got a big day tomorrow.” Sophia stood up and brushed herself down.
     “Night.” I whispered.
     I curled up on the battered brown sofa that had a chunk of stuffing pulled from it. I closed my eyes and hoped sleep would claim me.






Chapter Twelve
    

     I was pulled from my comfy sofa into a crowd of the sewer creatures. I could feel my body being pulled either side by the disgusting leaches. They wanted revenge, and by ripping me apart that’s how they would be appeased. I tried to pull against the horde but they had strength in numbers and I was just one little girl, scared and alone, fighting against the horde.
     “Let go!” I screamed at them.
     Tighter they gripped their black talon nails around my arms until scarlet drops trickled down my skin. I was forced down onto my knees, waiting to face their judgment. The floor then pounded as someone strong approached my vision. It was Barbus, his long matted dark hair hung around him like rats tails. He almost smelled as bad as the leaches. They threw me at him and Barbus caught me around the waist and pulled me closer until it hurt.
     “I told you I would find you.” His voice rang through my ears. “Do you think she can protect you? You are mine!” his voice vibrated throughout my body.
     “I am no ones, let me go.” I screamed.
     “You murdered their mother.” Barbus pointed to the group of leaches that lay in waiting. “They want their revenge and they will come for you and your friends.”
     “It wasn’t me, I didn’t kill her!” I yelled.
     His strong hands gripped my face until it hurt. “You stood by and did nothing! You are equally guilty!”
     “I tried to stop them.” I tried to explain myself but it was no use.
     Barbus laughed in my face and I felt hopeless. “I will let my leaches tear apart your friends as you watch.” 
     “I won’t let you!” I yelled.
     “You don’t have a choice. I’ll be seeing you very soon.” Barbus laughed as searing hot pain drove through my chest.
       
     I threw myself off the sofa expecting to take on the leaches, but found myself in the living room with Marcus staring at me.
     “Bad dream.” I muttered.
     “Oh, I’ve had my share of them.” Marcus replied. 
     I didn’t know whether or not to ask him about Barbus. Did he even know about him?
     “Uh, Marcus?” 
     “Yeah?” he answered.
     “Do you know anyone called Barbus?” I waited for his reply.
     “Barbus, name does ring a bell but cannot think where I’ve heard it before.”
     “Oh, it’s ok, never min-.” 
     “Got it!” Marcus blurted out “that’s where I know the name from. He’s wanted by the Protectors, nasty piece of work, he’s killed many of us. Why do you ask?”
     “He’s the one that captured me.” I replied.
     “Oh, I’m sorry.”
     “It’s ok, I’m slowly getting over it.” 
     “Well, he’ll get what coming to him very soon.” he said.
     Marcus then dropped down to the floor and began his exercises. 
      I tried to hide my embarrassment and it felt even weirder because of what Sophia had said last night. I tried to steal a glance at him while he did his routine stretches and exercises, his strong body began to tense and release as while puffing and pant while he counted.
     “Do you do that every day?” I asked him.
     “Yes, every day, got to keep my body in good shape.” He panted.
     “You look fine to me.” I blurted out and my face flushed with colour. Crap, crap.
     Marcus chuckled to himself.” Oh, you noticed did you?”
     “Sorry, I didn’t mean to stare.” I quickly said.
     Marcus stopped and picked himself up from his pushups. He pulled his t-shirt off revealing his flat strong stomach.
     I quickly spun around. “Do you really have to do that?” I asked.
     “What?” he chuckled “I don’t want to get my shirt sweaty do I?” 
     “Oh yeah, I guess you’re right.”
     “Sorry if I’m embarrassing you.” He said.
     I cleared my throat. “No, no you’re not.” 
     I decided to leave the hot awkward room, but Marcus followed behind me. As soon as I opened the door, Sophia spun on the spot and greeted us with a shocked expression. 
     “So what have you two been doing then?” Sophia asked.
     “What?” I asked.
     “Well, you come out of a room all hot and bothered, and Marcus follows with his top off and a sweaty body?” Sophia’s eyebrows went up and down suggestively.
     “Uh, no, you’ve got it all wrong.” I tried to say but there was no point.
     “Yeah, yeah. I’ll keep your secret safe.” she winked. 
     Marcus walked passed me and headed up the stairs. “Off for a shower.” He said.
     As he ascended the stairs I caught a glimpse of his strong sweaty back. It was covered with tattooed words that I could not make out. I tried to get a closer look but he quickly turned around and I had to drop my gaze.
     “There’s only cold water left.” Sophia reminded him.
     “That’s fine with me.” He said with a wink and disappeared off upstairs.
     Sophia turned back to me. “Now tell me all the details.”
     “There’s nothing to tell.” I mumbled.
     “Liar, I saw the two of you coming out of that room, and I’m sure I heard some huffing and puffing in there.” 
     “No, there was nothing like that!” I blurted out.
     “Liar.” laughed Sophia.
     “Oh yeah did you see the writing on Marcus’s back?” I asked.
     “No not really, I wasn’t looking. Oh, and I thought you weren’t interested?”
     “I’m not, it just caught my eye.” I replied. 
      We were soon interrupted by Rhea and Naaz entering from the kitchen with faces like stone. 
     “Ellie, a moment.” Rhea called me over to her and I knew this was going to be bad news.
     “I want to speak to you about the council.” she said.
     “Is it bad?” I asked.
     “No, it’s just the do’s and don’ts. Don’t speak to them unless spoken to. You will probably want to voice your opinion, but don’t. Address them as either lord or lady if spoken to and just let others do the talking, ok?” 
     I took a moment to think it over. I just had to remain quiet until they wanted me to speak. Just by thinking about the council made me very nervous. My stomach knotted tightly and I thought I was going to throw up. I took a few deep breaths and tried to steady my nerves.
     “Are you ok, Ellie?”
     “Yeah, yeah I’m fine.” I lied.
     Rhea gave me one last look and joined up with Sophia. I just stood there thinking of what the council could do to me. Torture, capture, or even just straight out kill me? I put the last suggestion to the back of my mind and hoped it would never come true. 
     “Where’s Marcus? We don’t need to keep them waiting.” asked Naaz.
     “He’s uh, in the shower.” I said.
     “Well, we haven’t got all day to wait for him.” She said “Go get him.” 
     “But he’s in the shower, he’ll be out when he’s ready.” I said nervously.
     Naaz stared at me and raised one curious eyebrow. “Good god girl, please tell me you’ve..”
     I quickly interrupted her. “No, I haven’t and if I go up there he’ll think I’m stalking him or something.”
     “Fine, I’ll go.” Naaz said and quickly walked up the stairs.
     Something inside me didn’t want Naaz going anywhere near Marcus, but I didn’t know why. Was I starting to fall for him, I didn’t have time for that right now.
     Naaz was at the top of the stairs but before she could enter, Marcus came out towel drying his hair. I breathed a sigh of relief and blushed just by thinking about him.
     Get a grip girl. We’ve got more important things to do then to fawn over some guy.
     “Right, now that everyone is here, we can get this over and done with.” Rhea said.
     Like many times before we stood in a circle and I grabbed onto Rhea’s hand, Marcus stood next to me and for once I would have like to have held his hand. 
     Focus Ellie. I told myself again.
     We were pulled away from Naaz’s home and hurtling towards the unknown. I still couldn’t get use to teleporting, but at least I didn’t throw up anymore. 
     We arrived at the front of what looked like a very large courthouse. Large stone walls covered around the building with large intimidating metal gate standing proudly at the front. A large brass knocker had attached itself to gate that took the shaped of a mocking grin. I turned to Rhea and she gave me an encouraging smile. The fear inside me built and I tried to hide it as best as I could. 
     “Don’t worry, it will be ok.” Rhea said.
     Naaz walked up to the grinning knocker and pounded on it twice. A few seconds later, two large men who looked like protectors appeared in front of us. Naaz acknowledged the two and pointed at me when they spoke. I slowly back away from them hoping to run if I needed to. The two men looked me up and down then walked up to me.
     “Are you Ellie Laveau?” One of the men asked.
     I swallowed a lump in my throat and tried to answer without fear fumbling my words. “Yes, that’s me.”
     The men nodded at each other and without touching me they herded me through the gates and up towards the imitating building. The court house stood tall with slanted sun damaged roofs. The building’s colour was white but you could tell it had faded. It needed a new coat of paint badly. I was marched up the long pathway towards the building, ready for my fate to be determined. 
     “Rhea?” I called out.
     “Don’t worry, everything is going to be ok.” she said.
     I took Rhea’s words to heart, but right now I needed more than just words.
     My so-called bodyguards ushered me into the building filled with people with grim faces, they looked like they were waiting for their own deaths, and I hoped to god that would never happen to me.  I was rushed passed many doors leading off into the unknown. Decorated on the walls were grand paintings done by hand of famous people throughout history. I couldn’t quite put a name to their faces, but some of them were a few that even I was shocked to see depicted on the walls. 
     We came to a stop at a normal looking door. I looked around, the area was devoid of people. Was my time up? I turned to both of the protectors.
     “Inside.” one of them said.
     My gut instinct was telling me to run and never to step into that room. I tried to slowly back away from it.
     “What’s in there?” I asked.
     “Inside.” The protector’s voice grew louder.
     Well there’s nowhere else to go. I said to myself.
     I pushed open the door, expecting the worst. I squeezed my eyes closed, hoping nothing bad would happen. The protectors slammed the door shut, locking me in. I rushed back to the door and started pounding on the sturdy wood.
     “Hey! Open the door!” I yelled. 
     It was no use, I was stuck here until they decided what to do with me. Now only realizing, sitting in the middle of the room was a tall podium that dominated the tiny looking room. Above me the floor boards warped around the weight of whatever was upstairs. Within seconds many footsteps filled into the room and there was chatter of voices of men and women. My palms began to sweat and my stomach was in a tuff of knots. I slowly breathed in and out and I tried to clear my busy mind. I needed to get a grip on myself, if I didn’t play this right I would be in big trouble. I just had to remember what Rhea told me. Speak only when spoken to and address them as either lord or lady. Was all this really necessary? A light on the wall pulsed red with the words STAND ON PODUIM. I nervously took my place and waited for my fate.
     The wooden podium rose up into the room above us, the crowd behind me gasped as if they had just witnessed a terrible crime. I looked back behind and I saw sitting on the front row was Rhea and the gang. She didn’t wave or smile, she just sat there with such elegance. I turned to the front to be greeted by four tall judge’s boxes. Each one filled with a person wearing a dark purple cloak. They looked down at me, each supporting a different mask. I felt like a tiny ant, ready to be squished by their wrath. 








Chapter Thirteen

     “This court has come to order.” said the voice of a man, he wore a full mask embodied with many crystals and jewels that reflected the light. 
     “You are Ellie Laveau, is that correct?” a screechy womanly voiced said. I looked up to face her mask. It was white china with gold motif around the eyes and red ruby lips. It looked so elegant. 
     Was this the time to speak? Oh crap, oh crap.
     “Yes, my lady.” I said formally.
     “The Siren everyone has been looking for?” another voice pierced the room. My eye caught his mask, it wasn’t like the others this one was creepy.  The dark purple robbed figure wore a baby doll mask with dark cracks around the eyes. I stared at it for a moment and I could feel it’s dark eyes penetrate inside me.
     “Yes, that’s me, my lord.” I said.
     “So, Miss Laveau. Why have you avoided us all this time?” Another voice came into play. This man wore a dirty white mask with a long protruding nose at the front. It had black rimmed eyes that looked like he wore spectacles.
     They all peered down at me waiting for me to answer them. “I haven’t been avoiding you; this is still all new to me. I didn’t even know about anything about this until recently.” I said.
     “We have had sources saying that you have been kept from us? Can you tell us more about that?” said the ruby lipped woman.
     “I know nothing of these so-called sources.” Deep down we knew it was Naaz who went running to the council to blab everything and now we were all paying the price. “And I have been in hiding for fear of my life.” 
     The peanut gallery behind burst into their fake gasps and I tried to suppress an urge to roll my eyes.
     “Quiet, quiet!” ordered the scary baby faced masked man.
     “Are these allegations true?” asked the jeweled masked figure. “Have you been on the run for your life?”
     “Yes, my lords. I have been attacked in my own home by the leaches.” As soon as the words left my lips the crowd behind began their gasps and their idle chatter. I guess the leaches are a sore point around here then. The four judges tried to get the court back into order.
     “Do you speak the truth?” asked the longed nosed masked man.
     “Yes, and they are still coming for me.” My voice trembled with a hint of fear. 
     The robe judges whispered amongst each other. Now and then they would stare at me and then return to their whispering. They finished their chatter and turned towards the crowd.
     “We have no knowledge of these so-called attacks.” The jeweled masked man said.
     What! Are these idiots blind, they sent us on that mission to kill Idina. 
     Something wasn’t right. Did they really have no knowledge of the leaches?
     “We can neither confirm nor deny that there leaches are roaming around un-checked and all we have is a word of a Siren.” The white masked woman said.
     While they talked amongst themselves again, something inside me wanted to spill every detail that I had witnessed. I wanted to hold my tongue but maybe some of the information will be useful. I took a deep breath and hoped for the best.
     “There seems to be a leader.” I raised my voice. 
     The judges stopped and slowly turned towards me, and I could feel their disapproval.
     “Excuse me?” said the baby faced masked man “How dare you speak without authority.”
     “Calm yourself, the Siren wishes to speak.” said the jeweled masked man. “Please continue.” 
     I took another deep breath. “Someone is commanding the leaches, giving them orders. They abducted me, and the person’s name is Barbus.” 
     More shocks and gasps came from behind me and even the judges were taken aback.
     “Is this true?!” the longed nosed man’s voice bellowed throughout the court room.
     “That so-called man has been wanted by the council for many years and you say that he has taken command of the leaches and abducted you.” asked the red lipped lady.
     “This is quite the tale you are spinning, young Siren.” added the long nosed man.
     “If she is to be believed, then we could all be in danger.” The baby masked man said.
     With the word danger now floating around, it had finally tipped everyone over the edge. Loud shouts and yelling filled the room while the four judges tried to get the room under control. I bowed my head down hoping to avoid their rage. The judges voices had their own say with each of their voices echoing. Even the crowd was getting a bit rowdy. This was getting out of hand, this was such a bad idea.
     “My lords and ladies!”  A serene and seductive voice called out from the chaos.
     I turned on the spot to see Rhea slowly making her way through the crowd and towards the judges. Oh crap, what’s she doing!
     She glided from her seat and made her way to the center, and stood beside my podium.
     “Rhea, it’s been too long.” said one of the men but I didn’t catch who it was.
     Rhea gave a little bow. “Lords and ladies, Ellie Laveau has been under my protection. She is a gifted creature and she requires the highest protection, and what she says is true. Barbus is the man who is pulling the strings, he abducted Ellie and used the leaches for his own selfish ends.”
     “You speak with such conviction, Rhea. We will talk about Barbus without prying eyes.” said the screechy voiced woman.
     “But how can the leaches be controlled? They are animals, they don’t take orders.” said the longed nosed masked man.
     “That is unknown to me as well, but he has created an army of them.” Rhea replied.
     “An army you say? Have you seen them for yourself?” asked the jeweled man.
     “Yes, I have your lords and ladies. It is truly a horrible site.”
     The council members talked amongst themselves with whispers. 
      “Now that you’re here, we can question you, Rhea. Do you deny that, you tried to hide a Siren from us? You know that they are forbidden creatures and are not for personal use?” said the baby faced man.
     “No I do not deny this. I saw that Ellie was in danger and sought out to protect her from anything that would harm her. And I still do that to this day.” Rhea said.
     “But where were you when this poor young girl got kidnapped?” asked the evil baby faced mask.
     I turned to Rhea and I saw a tiny glint of that darkness she tries so hard to contain. Within seconds the darkness faded and she was back to her normal self.
     “My lord, I’m surprised you have taken this to heart, since you wouldn’t have known about it, unless it had to be presented to you. You’re so wrapped up in your own little games that you cannot see what is happening outside, in the real world.” said Rhea.
     “How dare you! Know your place, this is our domain.” roared the baby faced man.
     “Domain or not, Ellie has come her willingly to plead her case.” added Rhea.
     “That is enough!” said the jeweled man. 
     The four judges turned in my direction. “Can you confirm that Rhea has been protecting you?” the red rose lipped lady said.
     “Yes, Rhea has been protecting me from the many things out there that wish to harm me, and I trust her judgment.”I said the words but did I actually believe them? I didn’t know anymore. 
     “Also, there has also been a massive surge in magical power recently, do you know anything about this?” The cracked baby faced man bypassed Rhea and asked me directly.
     I swallowed a lump in my throat and tried to speak but my mouth was too dry. I didn’t even know what he was talking about. I was about to speak but Rhea took the floor.
     “We know nothing of these power surges, Ellie is new to her powers and they are still growing, she is too young to do such things, and to even accuse this young girl of wrong doing is going beyond even your station.” 
     My mind then flooded with the memory of myself being possessed by the many spirits. I did cause that power surge, but how did they know about that? At that moment I felt like a guilty convict just waiting to be taken to jail and do my time. 
     “The question was asked to Ellie.” said the longed nosed man.
     I stared up at the four intimidating judges who held my fate in their hands. “No, I know nothing of this, my lord.” I held my voice as the best I could.
     “I did not want it to come to this but I invoke the protection of the old gods, Ellie is now under my protection.” said Rhea as she sat back down into her seat.
     Around me the court burst into cries of anger. Even the judges went along with the gasps. The four robbed judges tried to get the room under control by banging their gavels onto the desk but it was heard on deaf ears. 
     “Order, order!” cried the judges.
     What the hell just happened? I turned on the spot to see Rhea smiling from ear to ear. She liked this way too much. Even Sophia and Naaz looked at her with shocked expressions. 
     Soon after many cries, the room was under control. “We cannot let a Siren go out unchecked.” one judge said.
     “She is under the old god’s protection, there’s nothing we can do.” The red lipped woman said.
     “Surely we can keep her here.” said the baby faced man.
     “We have to abide by the rules and release her into Rhea’s care.” said the jeweled masked man. 
     “Are we all in agreement?” asked the baby faced man.
     There were nods and a few groaning noises coming from the unhappy judges.
     “Very well Rhea, we will entrust you with the Siren, but we will be watching you very carefully.” said the powder white woman.
      A chill made its way up to my spine. I then knew that they would be watching every move I’d make. Even a slightest mistake and they would know about it. Would the council always be watching me all my life, I hoped not.
     “You many leave.” said the longed nosed man with a wave of his hand.

     Finally, after standing in front of the four judges and waiting for them trying to decide my fate, I was allowed to leave with Rhea. I stepped down from my podium and walked out through the main doors and into the warm bask of the sun as a free woman.  
     "Thank god that's over with." I said stretching my muscles. I seemed to be tense all the way through.
     "Yes, I'm glad too." said Rhea. 
     “So why did they let me leave?” I asked.
     "Well, I didn’t want to do it but I knew what the outcome was going to be, so I had little choice and invoked the old god’s law. You are now under my protection and no one can take you away from me, not even the council." 
     “That was a very smart move, Rhea, but are you sure you did the right thing?” asked Marcus.
     Rhea didn’t answer him.
     “Who are the old god’s?” I asked them.
     “The old god’s are a group of the highest authority in our supernatural world and not just anyone can invoke their laws.” Sophia took a glance of Rhea but as she spoke “only people who are ‘special’ can do it, like Rhea.” 
     I was a little confused by it all but if it means I get to leave without harm, I have no problem with it.
     "I'm surprised that you invoked the old god’s law, Rhea, no one has done that in many years." Naaz said spitefully.
     We all turned towards her as she descended the court stone steps, her sheer dark dress blowing in the wind with ever step she took. There was a hint of movie star glamour about her, but I had to think twice, this was Naaz we were talking about.
     "Bit disappointed, Naaz?" Sophia asked.
     Naaz spun around and gave Sophia a dark piercing stare and carried on walking past us. As she drifted past me I stared at her, hoping to catch anything that could give away her motives. This woman was very dangerous, and I think she was reaching the end of her limit. She had tried to play the entire situation and she had lost.  
     “Naaz!” Rhea called out to her. “The council didn’t give us that job did they?”
     “What do you mean?” Naaz asked playfully.
     “The council had no knowledge of that mission to kill Idina did they? It was all you. You used us for whatever sick scheme you have planned.”
     “But what about the information I had? I would have known if Naaz had given it to me.” Marcus said.
     “Who did give you the information, Marcus?” I asked.
     Marcus started to think. “It was one of the protectors. He told me that we had been given a job to find the nest.” 
     Rhea gave Marcus her full attention. “Marcus, did you ever see the protector when we came back to the bunker?” 
     “No, did you.” He asked.
     “What? What’s wrong?” I asked eagerly.
     “We were betrayed, Ellie. That’s what’s wrong.” replied Sophia.
     I turned to Marcus who had fury written across his face.
     “What did you offer the protector?” Rhea asked. 
     “I have no idea what you are talking about, you and your weird imagination.” Naaz brushed off the accusations.
     “It’s true isn’t it, Naaz?” I asked. “You manipulated everything to your advantage, for whatever reason, you let leaches butcher innocent people and you killed Idina.” 
     “She needed to die! I did you a favour!” A sharp wind whipped around Naaz, her words fuelling her emotions.    
     Naaz gave us one last look and disappeared in a wave of darkness. 
     "I won’t let her get away with this" Marcus said.
     “She won’t.” replied Rhea.
     I looked up at Marcus and saw his sun kissed skin. He was truly breathtaking while he stood in the afternoon sunlight. All he features were lit up for all to see. I just stared at him and took in all that he was, his square manly jaw, his straight nose that had a little bump at the bridge, along with his perfect full soft lips. I was totally engrossed in him that I missed the question posed to me.
     "Ellie?" said Rhea.
     "Huh?” I replied.
     "I said are you ready?"
     "Ready for what?” 
     "Home, we can go home now." Rhea said.
     I nodded. I wanted to leave here immediately. There was something about this place that just made me feel uneasy. Maybe it was the power struggle I could feel coming from the four judges. I would not like to be locked in a room with them.  
     I entwined my hand with Rhea’s and the four of us were torn away from the council and hurtling back towards Naaz's dusty barracks. I had a feeling deep inside that something would be waiting for us.

Chapter Fourteen

     I arrived with the same sick feeling I always felt while teleporting, maybe I'll get the hang of it someday. Naaz had arrived before us and left to go upstairs to her own quarters. I had envisioned Naaz’s bedroom to be a sadist paradise. Chains, torture devices and god only know what else. I pictured her sleeping on a bed of nails, and no pillow would ever be comfortable enough for her, only the nails.   
     "Rhea, Naaz doesn’t look happy at all." Sophia asked.
     “She tried to play the game and she lost.” replied Rhea.
     "I don't like the vibe I'm getting from her at all." I said.
     "Maybe we've outstayed our welcome?" Marcus asked.
     "Yeah, I think so too." Rhea added.
     I made my way to the cosiest room in the house (well the only cosiest room). The others followed me like a pack of wolves, like I was their leader. I sat myself down at the foot of the roaring fire and thought of the judge’s ruling.
     That council meeting was too intense to put into words. I felt free, but leashed at the same time. The council said to be watching my every move from now on, and that didn’t sit well with me. I had never been called to something like that before. Was all that really necessary? The masks, the robes, and even putting me down into the floor to rise up like some carnival attraction for everyone to gawp at? They didn’t tell me anything I needed to know, and I was kinda’ pissed off at that. It was all just a formality for them, like appearances were the only thing that mattered to them and not the interest of the supernatural order.
     “Ellie?” a voice called out to me.
     I ignored my self loathing and looked up to see Rhea standing over me.
     “May I sit?” she asked.
     I nodded and shuffled to my left. 
     “Are you ok?” she asked.
     “To be honest, no. I’m more confused than ever. I thought going to the council would be good for me, but they just wanted to get a good look at the Siren, the freak.” 
     “I understand where you are coming from. But the council do not pander to others, they rule on what they see before them, luckily I stepped in when I did otherwise you would have been taking away.” explained Rhea.
     “I’m glad you did, I was really scared, and I thought they would kill me or take me away.”
     “I would never let it come to that.” she said.
     “They were not happy were they?” 
     “No they were not, there hasn’t been a Siren in many years, and with you just popping up have caused many people to become nervous and suspicious.” replied Rhea.
     “Why?” 
     “Because some people see you as a threat, those council members are not your allies. You need to remember that, Ellie.”
     “Did you know one of them?”
     “Yes, I knew one of them very well.”
     “How do you know him?” I asked.
     “We have crossed paths many times. I first met him when he was just working at the council, just low level jobs, but now he has worked his way up to the top.”
     “He must have some powerful connections.”
     “Among others.” Rhea replied “there is also the problem about the power surge.” said Rhea.
     “Oh yeah that.” I said sheepishly. “What would they have done to me if they found out it was me?” 
     “I don’t really know, but they didn’t.” said Rhea “It also makes me wonder how they found out.”
     “It was the siren souls, wasn’t it?” I asked.
     “Maybe, but something that powerful being released all at once, that’s bound to raise an interest.” Rhea replied.
I truly was in big trouble, with something like that being easily detectable. I really had to watch what I did with my powers in future.  
     “I heard you talking about me, about my powers.” I said.
     “Ellie, we wasn’t..” I cut her off.
     “I understand. My powers are growing too fast and they scare me but whatever happens, I will deal with it.” 
     “Understand.” she replied.
      “It really scares me that my powers are growing fast every day. Who knows what I am truly capable of?”
     “I’m sure in time you will be able to handle them.” 
     “But what if I can’t, you saw how that orb nearly drove me insane.”
     Rhea gave me her full attention and looked at me with fiery eyes. “Ellie, I know what ever comes your way, you will be able to fight it. You were captured and held prisoner for two weeks and you have come out strong.”
     Rhea’s words of wisdom struck a chord within me. I did come out of it, but did it make me stronger? I didn’t know, if I had been left in there a few more days, I would have given up. I wouldn’t call that strong.
     “So where do we go from here?” I asked.
     “Well, now that Idina is dead, there will be no more leaches, so that will decrease the numbers a bit. But there is Barbus left.” 
     Just mentioning his name made my body shiver. He had been invading my dreams lately and he seems so real. His touch on my skin, his breath on the nape of my neck just felt so realistic. Was it just a dream or was it something from the future, like the leaches? I haven’t even had time to tell Rhea about the dreams. But was now the perfect time?
     “Uh Rhea, I’ve been having more weird dreams lately.” My voice was dry and sore. To admit to Rhea I’ve been having these dreams were to admit that they were indeed real.
     “What about?” she asked.
     “I’ve been having dreams about Barbus.” Rhea’s body froze. She slowly turned her face towards me and it was full of horror.
     “When?” she quickly asked.
     “One when I was underground and one just the other night.” I said.
     “O-other night?” Rhea’s words caught in her throat.
     “What’s wrong?” I asked. “Is it a problem?”
     Rhea quickly got to her feet and rushed out of the room, leaving just her soft scent behind.
     “Rhea!?” I called after her but she disappeared from view.
     “What’s wrong with her?” Marcus came into the room with one of his smiles. Oh crap. 
     Behave yourself. 
     “You on your own?” he asked.
     “Yeah, just me.” I told him.
     Marcus slowly walked over to the fire and lowered himself into a sitting position.
     “Bet the council was scary?” he asked.
     “Yeah it was. I was terrified on the inside.” 
     “Well you didn’t show it.” 
     “I’m good at keeping my emotions all to myself, I’ve had lots of practice.” I said.
     “What do you mean?” he asked.
     “Well I used to hide all my emotions away, let’s just say I wasn’t the most popular kid in the school. I got bullied a lot for being what I am.”
     “I’m sorry for bringing it up.” 
     “No, it’s ok. Right now school has sounds better than this.” I replied.
     “Yeah, school wasn’t all good for me too.” 
     “Really? What was it like?” 
     “Well, when a protector’s child reaches a certain age they get shipped off to a military facility on an island, and the only way to get out is ether graduate or in a body bag. It was really rough, everything has to be done in a precise order. The tutors would drill you until you had everything, and I mean everything down to the last detail. The sword training was a bitch. They throw you in a pit on your first lesson with real swords, I was always back and forth the hospital wing.” 
     “Wow, did you ever see your parents?” I asked.
     “No, we only get letters and parcels now and then, but they did come for my final graduation. I cannot say it wall all bad but it did give me the skills to survive.”
     That had reminded me of what I saw on Marcus’s back. I didn’t know whether or not I should ask him about it.
     “Uh, Marcus?” I asked “what’s that tattoo on your back?” 
     “Oh, so you noticed that did you?” he chuckled.
     “Yeah, what is it?” 
     “Is this just a ploy for me to take my top off?” he asked jokingly.
     “What!? N-no its not.” My face was now bright red.
     Marcus laughed. “It’s the code of the protectors, every protector has one. It really hurt like a bitch when they did it. The strapped me down and just inked away.” Marcus turned away and lifted the back of his shirt up.
     His strong back was inked with three long black sentences, running from shoulder to shoulder. I was about to touch it, but I quickly held my hand still. I started to read the words out loud.
     “We are the wonderers of old. The one that watches all. We are equal in conquest in darkness and light. The protector of the just and unjust.”
     “Yep, that’s it.” He said.
     “What does that mean?” I asked as he pulled his shirt back down.
      “No one really knows, everyone has their own interpretation of it, to me it sounds like, you may not see it, but it doesn’t mean that it’s not there, something along those lines.”
      “So every protector has this on their back?”
     “Yeah, so you like it do you?” he asked.
     “Would it matter even if I did like it?”
     “Maybe.” he replied. 
     He moved closer towards me and I could smell his bodily scent, salty sweat with desire. He smelt really nice which was weird. My eyes travelled down from his face and to his strong arms that he flexed. Something inside me was attracted to him and I wanted him, now. He turned to me and I looked deep into his eyes. There was a hunger inside and I needed to be fed.
     “Ellie, are you ok?” he asked.
     I moved closer to him and with just one touch he would be mine. We could be together, I slowly moved my hand towards his. Marcus noticed and shot up quickly.
     “What are you doing?” he asked.
     “I want you, Marcus.” the words sounded alien.
     “No, don’t do this, you’ve been through enough. Don’t come closer.”
     “Oh come on, it’ll be fun? Don’t you want some fun?” The words flowed freely from my mouth.
     I was on the prowl and he was my prey. I slowly slunk towards him, I would catch him and he could finally be mine.
     “We’ve been cooped up inside this room for many days now, and you’ve never thought of it?” I asked with seduction in my voice.   
     “N-no, never, w-why would you say that?” Marcus fumbled his words.
     “Come on don’t you want a release, it would be fun.” 
     “Help, Rhea!” he shouted out.
     He’s going to ruin my fun, I picked up my speed and I backed Marcus in a corner, he was now trapped. I was excited from the chase as blood pumped though my body, I jumped towards him, hands outstretched. Just one touch, just one. My body stopped mid-air and I went flying backwards, thankfully the soft sofa caught my fall and I quickly got back onto my feet ready for another chance.
      “Out of the way!” I yelled at Rhea. I charged straight for Marcus but she quickly came between us and gripped both of my hands.
     “Let go!” I screamed.
     I struggled from her strong grip as I could feel my heat, my desire, flowing from my body and into Rhea’s. She was absorbing my animalistic nature.   
     She finally released me and I fell to the floor, panting. I felt like I had run a marathon in a few short minutes. “I’m so sorry, Marcus.” I said between breaths.
    “It’s ok, I know it wasn’t you.” he replied.
     “But it was, I was in control of all my actions, but I knew it was wrong. I just couldn’t get a hold of myself.” I said. “I’m just glad Rhea came in when she did.”
     I looked up at her, expecting to see fury across her face, but she looked down on me with a sympathetic look.
     “What’s happening to me?” I asked her.
     “You are stretching yourself far too much Ellie, you need to rest, and your emotions must be all over the place.” she explained.
     “Yeah, I just need to rest.” I gave out a big sigh.
     “You have been through a lot, Ellie.” added Marcus.
     “Don’t worry, I’m sure that if you get enough rest it won’t happen again.” Rhea said. 
     Before I could reply, something flew past the door and landed with a scream. The three of us rushed out of the room and out into the hall to see Sophia sprawled out on the tiled floor. Rhea hurried over to her and I looked towards whatever had caused it. Naaz stood there with one hand outstretched and a book under her arm.















Chapter Fifteen



     “What is the meaning of this!?” Rhea’s voice was harsh and demanding.
     “What does it look like, the scales have tipped in my favour. I’ll let the leaches have the scraps when I’m through with you.” Darkness scattered out of Naaz’s hand and it headed towards Rhea.
     I tried to warm Rhea but it was too late. The darkness had found its target and shattered the ground bellow. Dusty tiles were uprooted from the ground and thrown in different directions, I tried to find cover but the blast was too strong and I went rolling across the floor. The house’s foundation begun to shake and I didn’t think it would last, not if there was a showdown between two demi gods.
     “Rhea!” I called.
     The smoke dispersed around Rhea, there wasn’t a scratch on her. Sophia lay beside trying to catch her breath. Rhea stared at Naaz, her face full of pure rage.
     “That’s borrowed power, is that from you new master?” Rhea spitefully asked.
      Naaz’s eyes widened. “Powerful isn’t it.” Naaz descended the stairs with the same disgusting grin she loved so much. It showed how evil she truly is.
     “You come into my home and beg for refuge, you were so pathetic. What else could I do, then I get an offer to turn you over, how could I refuse?” 
     “After what we’ve been through together!?” asked Rhea. 
     “It was too easy. I’m going to kill all of you, but they want the Siren, but let’s start with her first. I didn’t get to finish her off. ” Naaz’s sights were set onto Sophia.
     “You won’t touch her!” roared Rhea. 
     Around us the air felt heavy and it got harder to breathe. Rhea’s motions were a blur and something white lanced its way towards her opponent. The air shimmered in front of Naaz and the jet of light rebounded off her and towards the walls, destroying part of the house. Pieces of brick and plaster tore off and flew towards us, I had time to quickly hide behind one of the pillars.
     “I thought I taught you better than that?” she laughed.
     Naaz dropped the book and held both hands up into the air. Her hands formed into claws and there was darkness forming between her fingers. From within the floor something was trying to break free. Pillars of darkness escaped from the floor and they were heading our way. Marcus and I ran from the oncoming destruction, we wouldn’t win at this rate, I stopped and faced the darkness as it headed for me.
     “Ellie!” shouted Marcus.
     I didn’t have time to answer him, I screamed at the pillars and one by one they shattered like glass.
     It was now Rhea’s turn, she sent out a wave of electricity that sparked along the way towards Naaz.     
     Sophia limped towards us. “We need to help her!” she yelled.
     “There’s nothing we can do they are demi gods, they are too powerful, we’d be killed!” Marcus said.
     Another explosion sent ripples through the floor. He was right, what could we do. We don’t stand a chance against her.
     I watched at Naaz pushed forward her hands. The darkness snaked onto the floor looking for its victim. Rhea slowly backed away from it but it struck out latching onto her arms and legs. She was caught, Rhea fought against the darkness, but it slowly coiled around her. I couldn’t let her die out there. I had to do something. Something inside me burst with courage and I rushed out to meet Naaz head on. 
     “Ellie, don’t!” shouted Marcus but he was too late.
     I stood in her path. I was not letting her hurt Rhea anymore.
    “Move child!” Naaz snapped.
     “You won’t hurt her anymore you bitch!”
     Naaz eyes were wild. She pushed out with her hands and she was ready to harm me. Before I could act I was grabbed by Marcus and we both hit the floor, I quickly moved away but my eyes caught a scarlet pool starting to form on Marcus’s t-shirt.
     “Marcus!” he had been hit on his right side, blood trickling down from his wound.
     “It’s nothing?” he said.
      Naaz laughed at his pain. I then spun around to greet Naaz head on.
I closed my eyes and felt all the anger and hate that I once felt long ago. I channelled it and released it towards Naaz. She brought out her hands but it was too fast for her. She was blown back, crashing against the wall. 
     “You bitch!” she spat. “I’ll send you to hell!”
     Naaz soon got to her feet and threw ribbons of darkness into the air. They weaved and spun throughout the air, looking for its target. I stood there captivated while they dived straight for me. I squeezed my eyes shut and I hoped for the best. Slowly, I opened my eyes to see Sophia in front of me with a barrier erected around us.  
     The darkness stabbed at the dome, but they vanished one by one. Sophia turned to me with a faint smile. A tiny amount of blood came down from her nose and she fell to her knees. Quickly, I rushed down beside her and went to pick her up but I snatched back my hands before it was too late.
     "Are you ok?" I asked.
     "Yeah, I'm fine just overdid it a little." she replied.
     "That's enough!" Rhea screamed behind me.
     Her body showered itself in a radiant white and the darkness latched on evaporated into smoke.
     "You want another round?" asked Naaz.
     "I'm going to end this!" she yelled.
     Rhea punched the air in front of her and Naaz flew through the air and crashed landed on the floor. Rhea’s eyes were now locked onto Naaz and flared a bright crimson. It was the darkness, I could see it clear as day. She lifted Naaz into the air and pulled at her limbs until Naaz screamed in pain.
     This was too much, even for Naaz. “Rhea, stop it!” I screamed.
     Rhea continued with her torture with glee. “Enough!” I screamed.
     She then finally turned to me with sweat dripping from her. Rhea nodded and released her hold on Naaz and she fell to the floor, she was just barely alive. Marcus carried himself over to Sophia and picked her up while holding his wounded side. Rhea and I crept towards the broken woman. She was breathing heavily and she was bleeding.
     "Why did you do this?" Rhea asked.
     "Why, because whatever is out there wants her, and when it does I don't want to be standing in its way." she replied.
     "I'm sorry that I have to do this." Rhea whispered.
     Rhea was about to deliver the finishing blow when Naaz quickly pushed out with her uninjured hand. Darkness flooded Rhea's body throwing her through the air, cutting and slashing at her skin.
     Rhea fought against the rapid darkness that tore at her porcelain skin. I watched as her body glowed the warm ebbing glow that I came to love and soon the thick darkness evaporated from her body. Naaz made her move and the book flew into her bloodied hands.
     "He will destroy you all." Naaz left with her final words into a cloud of darkness.










Chapter Sixteen


     "Is everyone alright?" I called out.
     Everyone remained silent. Did that just happen just now, did Naaz betray us? Was it all a lie? I looked around the destroyed hall, Sophia and Marcus laid on the floor amongst the debris. I rushed up to Marcus who smiled once he saw me. His shirt was red with his crimson life force, he had lost quite a lot of blood. 
      “Are you ok?” I asked him but he ignored the question.
     "Who was Naaz talking about? he asked.
     “Marcus!” I yelled “are you ok?”
     His eyes then refocused onto me. “Yeah I’m ok, are you?” but knew he was lying.
     “Rhea!” I called.
     She made her way to Marcus and placed her hand to his side and started to heal him. I watched in amazement as his skin knitted itself back together. 
     “Thanks for saving me.” I said.
     “It was nothing.” He gave a weak little smile.
     “What the hell do we do now then?” asked Sophia. 
     “I don’t know, but I think we should get the hell out of here.” I replied.
     We all stood around Rhea waiting to get the hell out of here, when the walls imploded before us. We were all thrown back, losing our grip on each other.  
     I flickered my eyes open only to hear a loud ringing throughout my ears. My hazy stare looked around to see the front of the building was destroyed, scattered around us. The familiar snarls and groans brought back the fear I thought I locked up tight. Slowly, I picked myself up but I fell back down as the room began to spin around me. Then as I tried to deny it, I heard the familiar voice that ran chills up my spine.

     "I told you I would find you!" He yelled throughout the half destroyed hall.
     Marcus shot up from the floor and unleashed his sword from it sheath and headed into the crowd of leaches, hacking and swinging with perfect precision.
     "Marcus!" I called after him but he was deep within the leaches.
     Sophia rushed down beside me. "Come on we need to get to Rhea." she said.
     Rhea was surrounded by leaches and she was too weak to fend them off. I rushed to her and screamed at the leaches, sending them spiralling off throughout the air. Sophia and I grabbed onto Rhea and helped her to her feet as two leaches rushed us head on. Rhea reached out weakly and sparks of ebbing light flickered from her fingers. It struck the leaches straight through the chest but it didn't kill them. I screamed at them finishing what Rhea could not.
     "She's too weak." Sophia said.
     "We need to get out of here, now!" I yelled.
     I looked behind and saw Marcus fending off many leaches. He had a few scratches to his face and arms.
     "We need to help him." I said.
     We placed Rhea against the wall and I rushed back to Marcus, ignoring Sophia's words behind me.
     "We need to leave!" Marcus had more cuts to his face and to his arms.
     Three leaches prowled towards us with their claws outstretched. Marcus took one swing and disembowelled the leach in front. I made sure Marcus wasn't in my path and screamed. The creatures scattered in different directions. I looked over and saw Barbus, he watched with interest as we killed our way through the leaches. He took the opportunity to join fight. 
     I was caught off guard as a leach behind me sliced at my skin. Marcus heard my screamed and quickly took down the leach behind me.
     "Marcus, we need to leave now!" I said while clutching my fresh wound.
     He agreed and we rushed back towards Sophia who was with Rhea.
     "Barbus is here and we need to move, now!" I quickly told them.
     "She's too weak to move." Sophia said.
     "We need her." added Marcus.
     I turned my back on them and saw Barbus swiftly making his move towards us. If I didn't do something then we would all pay the price. I decided that I would not run away from him anymore, I rushed off towards him screaming at any leaches that came forward.
     “Ellie!” shouted Marcus.
     “Hold him back, Sophia.” I called over my shoulder.
     I stood in Barbus’s path ready for anything.
     "I told you I would find you." He said with a disgusting smile on his lips.
     “You won’t have me!” I yelled out.
     “You are mine!” he shouted throughout the broken hall.
     My memories brought me back to the rotten and disgusting dungeons that once were my home. How every day I was abused by him and his foul creatures while they laughed and stood by and drugged me. This is where I say no to it all. I will not be anyone’s plaything. I will not be put down by anyone.
     Something inside of me roared to life and I felt empowered by it.
     “No more!” I screamed. 
     My Siren scream hurtled towards Barbus, while causing destruction along its way, ripping up the half-broken marble floor and the debris of the building hurtling at him. It struck Barbus through the chest throwing him into a group of leaches. 
     I rushed back to the gang. “I’ve bought us a few minutes, at least.” I said.
     They greeted me with silence. “What’s wrong? We need to move!” 
     “We have an idea.” Marcus said.
     “But it’s too dangerous!” Sophia snapped at him.
     “It’s the only way we are going to get out of here!”
     I looked over my shoulder to see Barbus getting to his feet with the help of the other leaches. 
     “Fine, but she’s not going to like it.” Sophia took Marcus’s blade, quickly cleaned it with her dress and made a clean cut to her palm. I watched while Sophia placed her bloodied hand onto Rhea’s bare chest. The crimson life force slowly seeped into her skin. Rhea awoke and looked at us with empty dark stares.
     “What did you do?” I asked.
     “It’s called blood magic.” she replied “but it’s very dangerous.” 
     “Rhea, can you hear me?” I asked.
     Rhea’s eyes turned into pools of darkness, she wasn’t the Rhea I once knew. We all took a step back, fearing what she would do.
     “Sophia, what have you done?” I said.
     “What have you done?! This isn’t who I am anymore!” Rhea cried.
     “Siren!” Barbus barked.
     “He’s coming we need a plan quick.” 
     Rhea stood onto her feet and made her way towards Barbus. The two of them met face to face and Barbus took a step back, he knew what she had become.
     “So you’ve embraced the darkness again?” he said.
     “Only to protect the ones I love.” she replied. Rhea’s voice wasn’t the way I remembered it, it took on a darker tone.
     Barbus rallied his leaches around and they charged towards Rhea. She did not move, she just stood there waiting. Closer the horde came nearer, but Rhea wasn’t fazed. 
    “Rhea!” I screamed.
     She finally waved her hand and the leach horde exploded into black ash, leaving Barbus to fend for himself.
     “Darkness suits you.” he said.
     She didn’t reply. Rhea brought out her hands and pools of thick tar like darkness swirled out. It moved effortlessly throughout the hall, almost as if it was alive. Barbus ducked and dodged the approaching blackness as it flew into the air and dived straight down for him. Barbus shot off his own power, red lightning charged it’s was towards her, but Rhea blocked it and laughed at his feeble attempts. She wore a dark smile to fit the darkness that filled inside of her. Rhea enjoyed toying with Barbus, like his life meant nothing. The dark tendrils latched onto him and brought him up into the air.
     Rhea then fell onto her hands and knees, struggling against her own inner darkness.
     “Rhea!” Sophia rushed by her side. 
     “What’s wrong with her?” I asked.
     “It’s draining away her life.” Sophia replied.
     The tendrils disappeared from Barbus’s body and he fell to the ground. “No!” Rhea yelled.
     She pushed Sophia away from her and was intent on destroying her target, no matter what.
     “Marcus, take Ellie and leave, now!” shouted Sophia.
     “What about you?” I asked.
     “I have to stay with her, I won’t leave her.”
      “No, I don’t want to lose anyone else.” I said.
     “Go!” she shouted.
     “Ellie, we need to go.” added Marcus.
     “Sophia?” I just stared at her, she was serious. She had said her feelings on the matter, nothing I could say would change her mind.
     I reluctantly followed after Marcus, but Barbus blocked our path.
     “No!” growled Rhea.
     A dark tendril snaked its way through Barbus’s body, picking him up on the spot and throwing him away. Marcus and I carried on ahead but something inside of me wanted to go back and help, but all of this was about trying to keep me safe. Everything that we’ve done would have been a waste. Against my judgment I didn’t look back.
      Marcus and I reached the dead garden and there were more leaches waiting outside, ready to ambush us. 
     “There’s just no end.” I said. 
     They moved closer once they saw fresh prey.
     “Get behind me.” I said to Marcus.
     “I should be saying that to you.” Marcus replied.
     I quickly ran in front of him and screamed at the oncoming leaches while Marcus slashed at them from the side.
     “Let’s go!” I yelled.
     I ran through the fallen leaches with Marcus on my heels. We now arrived at the entrance to the grand building. The stone wall that covered around Naaz’s residency was in ruins. We slowly walked along the bridge, hoping that it would not break and send us into a watery grave. Behind me loud bangs and explosions filled my ears. I looked back and saw the building being destroyed from within. Blasts of red and black escaped pierced from within the building. I watched as an explosion so strong that it sent ripples along the ground and tore the earth apart. I looked in horror as the building that I once took refuge in was falling off the cliff and down into the unknown.
     “No!” I screamed at the scene I witnessed.
      The bridge we stood on started to break away and we hurried on over to the other side. I skidded and feel to my knees in tear as I saw the building with my friends in falling apart. I felt sick to my stomach and I couldn’t make the tears stop. From within the woods were more groans that I came to hate. There were leaches lurking in the forest just waiting for easy meat. I picked myself up and stood my ground.
     “I’m so sick of this!” I screamed.
     My breathing was heavy and I felt like I was ready to explode with rage. I used that rage to fuel my power. I screamed at the leaches and they were uprooted like flowers in an updraft. They hit against the trees, their bones snapping in the process. 
     “Ellie?” whispered Marcus.
     I turned my tear filled face towards him and for the first time in my life I didn’t know what to do.
     “We need to go.” He softly said.
     “Go, go where!?” I yelled.
     “We just have to keep moving.” he replied.
     “What’s the point, everyone keeps on dying, and you’ll probably be next.” 
     The hurtful words just kept flowing and I couldn’t stop them. I needed to vent my rage on someone, or something.
     “Ellie, if I could I would comfort you.”
     “But you can’t, can you. Nobody can touch me!” I yelled.
     “I know.” he sadly said.
     “Is this what my life has come down to, running for my life and getting everyone around me killed?” I took a deep breath “If that what life’s got in store for me then they can shove it!”
     I wiped my face with the back of my hand and looked up at Marcus. I couldn’t get him killed as well, I didn’t want that. Then an awful thought popped into my head, and I didn’t know if I should do it. I walked closer towards him, almost near enough to feel the heat that radiated from his sweat filled body.
Chapter Seventeen

     “I’m so sorry.” I whispered.
     Marcus gave me a confused look, but before he could work it out I snatched out and took his strong hand into mine. This was the first and last time I would get to hold his hand. At first he put up a struggle but I was too strong for him. I looked deep into his mind and saw how much he thought of me and how much he wanted to protect me. But what I was doing was to protect him. 
     “Do not follow me, forget my name and forget me.” I said with tears in my eyes.
     I let his hand drop from mine, and he wore the vacant stare that many wore before him. I took one last look at Marcus and turned my back on him, on it all. I walked away while trying not to burst into tears.
