Prologue

Headlights lit up the dark living room as a black, unmarked sedan pulled into the driveway. A man sitting silently in the corner arm chair lifted his head from his fingertips and focused sharply on the late night visitor. 
The man was used to hosting many guests, mostly dignitaries and officials sent on palace business. The guests would come and go with lots of pomp and circumstance, reminding the man that he was a servant. He was a servant, to the Monarchy, the palace, the King.
The guests would also come with lots of warning. The car parked out front came with no notice and it caused the man to focus. He wasn’t afraid. He wasn’t worried. He was just curious. 
Standing up slowly, he felt the tingling of magic ignite in his blood. They couldn’t disguise themselves, those that were like him. He could feel their presence before they were too close. Their similar magic, like a warning flare, always reminding him of whom he was, of whom he belonged to. 
He expected the worst, the end to a too long life. The house he had made his home in recent years would be perfect for this tragic finale. An empty tomb holding centuries of memories, most of which he would have loved to forget. The expensive but empty house would be perfect to bid good-bye to this life. It felt like his over-lived existence: too large, too old and too empty. 
He half wondered who they would send. He wondered who would be strong enough to finish the job no one previously had been able to finish. This time he wouldn’t fight. He was tired of fighting. He was tired of victory. There was nothing left for him to win. The people he had believed in had let him down. The King he had expected the worst from hadn’t. It was time to give up. Time to throw in the towel and let them destroy him; along with the cause he alone was defending. He was ready. 
Finally, he was ready. 
But as the magic moved towards the door, he was surprised to find it not threatening, but familiar, like an old magic, from an old friend. A friend from a different time and one that he had hoped to never meet again because he knew she must be desperate to brave this visit. 
“Hello, Angelica,” the man answered the door before the old woman could knock. Her long white hair glistened in the moonlight, and she returned his scowl with a gentle smile and sad violet eyes. 
“Hello, Amory,” Angelica’s arms were full of something covered with blankets. She pushed past him; his tall, muscular frame took up most of the door way. The cold night of a winter turning into spring blew quietly into the house, but encouraged the man to shut the door quickly behind them. 
Once the door was shut, Amory turned the lights on in the darkened house, planning to invite the woman in for the night. The house now lit, took on a different personality from before. What once felt like a stark and empty room was now warm and inviting with the soft glow of light. A simple burst of magic brought a roaring fire to life and warmed the room, as quickly as it was lit. 
Angelica sat down on a large leather couch near the fire. Her arms were still full of blankets and her expression still sad. 
“Let me take those from you,” Amory offered, realizing Angelica looked frail and tired under her packages. 
“I would love that,” her face lit up just a little bit as Amory bent over to take the first bundle out of her right arm. 
As his strong hands slipped underneath a blue blanket to lift the package from her, they stopped suddenly, paralyzed by the soft and warm body underneath. Pulling his hands away, he stared at her with fear in his eyes. 
“What is this?” he asked, nearly choking on his words. 
“Take a look for yourself,” she nodded her head and encouraged him with tender eyes.   
“Who? What? It can’t be,” Amory fumbled through words afraid of what was in either arm. 
Eventually he found enough courage to pull the blue blanket away from a sleeping infant, not more than a week old. The little boy was perfect, tiny and soft with chubby cheeks and a thick head of dark curly hair that seemed too much for his little head. He stared at the child for several seconds recognizing his parents without ever needing confirmation. 
He looked back to the woman who smiled even sweeter, a tear escaping from one of her violet eyes, making their strange color stand out starkly against her pale and wrinkly skin. She nodded to the other bundle, one wrapped in a pink blanket. Amory shook his head and stepped back. 
The baby boy had not scared the man; it was the second bundle that had concerned him so. Several seconds passed before Amory found the courage to pull the blanket away from the second sleeping child. Almost identical to her twin brother, with chubby cheeks, and dark, unruly hair, she was unmistakably a girl, but with almost an angelic quality and a sweet, small nose. 
“It’s not possible,” Amory shook his head again, noticing the tiny buzzing of infant magic swirling around him for the first time. 
“That’s what I said,” Angelica held out the baby girl and, shaking slightly, Amory took her into his arms, feeling like the smallest mistake would shatter the fragile child. 
“How did they….? How did you….? How did they get here?” Amory stumbled through several half questions before settling on the most recent. Twins did not exist in their culture, or at least they hadn’t in thousands of years. 
“Two days ago, Justice came to me in the middle of the night with these two. He stayed for only a couple minutes, just long enough to explain that these were their children, their first and only, that they were twins, and that Delia and he were fine.” She cuddled the little boy in her arms, pressing her cheek against his head gently. “And, Amory, he asked me to bring them to you. It was Delia’s idea.” She stared down at the sleeping child, afraid to look up into her dear friend’s eyes. 
Although Amory was infinitely older than her, no one would have been able to tell. His black hair showed no signs of gray, and his matching black eyes were as sharp as ever. She was nearing the beginning of old age and looked it. Her face was wrinkled and hair perfectly white; her hands were gnarled and she showed a lifetime of hardship that she was unwilling to admit to. 
“To me?” His voice betrayed the fear he felt and took on the sweet cooing of a gentle soul speaking to a baby. The little girl sighed heavily in his arms as if perfectly content to be there. 
“Yes, to you. They are choosing to stay hidden. The children would not survive if they stayed with them.” Although she was the younger of the two, Angelica’s voice took on a stern maternal quality that showed her desire to protect the two infants fiercely. 
“And you suppose they will survive if they stay with me?” Amory’s voice did not lose the sweet, soft tone, but his question was valid. 
“They have to. This is a miracle, Amory, an unbelievable miracle. They have to survive for the sake of our people,” Angelica stood, walking to Amory and putting her free hand against his face. 
Amory looked deeply into Angelica’s lavender eyes and knew that she was right. The hope he had lost so many years ago was suddenly ignited again by these two seemingly impossible infants. The children continued to sleep in their arms, but made little noises only newborn babies did, oblivious to their surroundings, innocent of the world they were entering. 
“Then we cannot keep them together, Annie. They cannot have anything to do with each other if we hope to keep them alive.” Amory looked back at the little girl, already the spitting image of her mother. She opened her eyes at the sound of his louder voice and gazed up at him. She did not cry; she only stared back at the man now responsible for her future. 
“Agreed,” Angelica nodded with resolve. “Then we will leave now.”
She covered the little boy again with his blue, fleece blanket and leaned over to kiss the girl on the forehead. The baby lifted her mouth to the human contact, looking for a bottle. 
“I don’t think I remember how to do this,” Amory was suddenly swept with a different kind of fear as he realized the child, although necessary to the cause recalled in the old man’s mind, had needs of her own; needs that a lonely bachelor was extremely ill-equipped to provide for. 
“I have no doubt that you’ll figure it out,” Angelica reached for Amory’s face again, offering an encouraging smile before kissing him on the lips. 
“Where will you go?” he asked her as she walked towards the front door, that she had only just entered. 
“Not home,” she said sadly. “You?” 
“I have no choice but to stay here,” Amory said with all the malice he was capable of. 
“Then what will you do with the child?” The fear in Angelica’s voice was unmistakable. She had made a choice in bringing the children to Amory, and it was too late to change her mind, but regret flooded her veins when she realized the danger she had put all of them in. 
“I have a dear friend here that will help me, a human friend. She is young but immeasurably smart and capable.” A sly grin crossed Amory’s face; he felt confident in his plan.
“Ah. You mean she is in love with you,” Angelica watched the embarrassment color her friend's face, but he didn’t respond; no matter how long the man lived, he stayed humble and private. “I will contact you when we have settled somewhere.” 
She turned to leave, opening the door and looking out across the deserted neighborhood street. 
“Angelica, these children are our only hope," Amory said quickly with more passion than he had felt in almost a century. 
“I know,” she replied with determination. 
“Annie, wait. Please know,” his voice broke with emotion, “please know what they mean to me.” 
“I know that too,” Angelica did know, but it was with a sadder determination that she responded. 
The man watched his friend carefully load the child back into the black sedan. Their departure was bittersweet, tearing at his determination to keep these children alive under any circumstance and his unwillingness to ever be separated from them again. 
If this plan, this plan of survival born in the midnight hours were to work, his resolve would have to be strong. Magic swirled around him, as he watched her twin brother be driven away to safety, not knowing when the next time the siblings would meet. 
He looked down at the little girl, wrapped in pink and sleeping again and smiled. There was hope again for his people. There was something worth living for, worth fighting for. And she was the key to it all. She just didn’t know it yet.
Chapter One

“Well, here we go,” I said softly to myself. I took a big breath and stepped out of the car. I gave a cautious wave to Aunt Syl as I watched her drive away. She waved back enthusiastically. I felt anything but encouraged.   
I had to go to school, right? I did not have a choice. I was pretty sure it was against the law not to go…. I tried to think of other reasons to postpone the inevitable but came up empty handed. Social suicide…. I was well on my way.  
I cringed inwardly, knowing I looked like a hot mess. I could feel my tan skin, turning translucent with nerves, and my unruly, dark hair, tangled and wild as I stood too long in the wind. It whipped around my face in the hot, humid breeze, partially blocking the impending view from sight. I brushed my hair out of my face, but it refused to obey and with another gust of unbearably hot August air, I was forced to walk forward to maintain my sight.  
I felt sick and nauseous; I was practically on the verge of puking. I closed my eyes for several seconds and then opened them again, hoping I’d be someplace else, any place else. But I was right where I was supposed to be: staring up at my new school. The tall, ominous buildings clustering together, stared back. Their dark, red brick laughed at me silently, daring me to run away. The central tower, with its golden bell, and deep sweet chimes taunted me, mocked me.  
Ok, maybe I was being a little over dramatic, but school had never been my, um, thing. It could have been because I was a complete social spaz; or it could have been because this was my fourth school in two years. Either way, I always seemed to have trouble adjusting to teenage normalcy.
Kingsley Preparatory Academy was a last resort of sorts. Well, really, it was the last prep school that would take me; God forbid I would attend public school. As the niece and only surviving relative of my aunt, the doctor, I was destined for a higher education.  
If only I could have gone six months without being expelled. Kingsley was the last prep school in Omaha that had given me a chance, and that was only after a very generous contribution from my aunt and a promise from me that I wouldn’t burn it to the ground. Although I harbored no ill will for the school itself, I was not sure if I could keep my promise.
Not that I would burn it down on purpose, but that kind of stuff just happened to me. The burning down of schools, the flooding of schools, and the infestation of huge, tropical insects of schools…. All fell into the category of been there, done that. It's not like I ever did it on purpose; it all just sort of happened.  
So after another deep breath, I began my death march to the top of the hill and the large, brass, double doors that led into the Administration Building. The doors slammed shut behind me, making me almost jump out of my skin. The lobby was dimly lit; it took a while for my eyes to adjust from the bright sunlight outside.  
Kingsley was immaculate; beautiful marble floors and elaborate lighted sconces filled the lobby. An intricate, crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling and gave the room a warm glow that reminded me of dusk rather than 8:00 AM. Plush, crimson divans lined the lobby, and oil paintings of elderly people adorned the walls. I reminded myself that this was a school building and not the sitting room to a luxurious Victorian home.
I forced my feet forward and adjusted my backpack straps. I stopped to fiddle with my uniform, afraid to make the wrong first impression. The front counter, located directly on the other side of the lobby was crafted from a beautiful wood, probably mahogany, that expanded the width of the room and stood elbow-high. I walked the rest of the way tentatively, as this was like no other school building I had ever been in, and I'd had my fair share of experience.  
An elderly woman, with snow-white hair and small-framed glasses, sat behind a small desk made from the same wood as the counter that partitioned us. Her posture was perfect and her legs crossed properly, as she focused typing at her computer. A name-plate that read “Mrs. Truance” decorated her desk, facing me. She glanced my way from the top of her spectacles and gave a little sigh.  
“You must be Eden Matthews,” she declared more as a statement than a question.
“Yes, I am,” I choked out.  
“Welcome to Kingsley,” she said tersely. Mrs. Truance stood up gracefully and walked over to me with some sheets of paper in her hand. “Here is your class list and map of the campus. It can be quite confusing, so please ask for help if you get lost.”
“Thank you, I will,” I tried to smile, but she had already turned away and headed back to her desk. So instead, I looked down at my class list and found my first hour of torture to be English.  
I shuffled through the papers until I found a map of the campus. Junior AP English was located in the English and Arts Building, which appeared to be two buildings east of this one.  
“Please hurry, Kiran. I don’t want you to be late for our first day,” a peculiar accent and heavy footsteps made me turn to see two figures walk through the brass double doors I had just come in. The bright sunshine illuminated the lobby; I was blinded for a moment as the doors slammed for a second time. My eyes took a moment to adjust again.
“Stop worrying; I’m royalty for God’s sake!” barked the second voice with a strong, aristocratic English accent that sounded irritated. As they walked closer, I could see that they were dressed in the Kingsley uniform, and close to my age.  
The first boy who spoke resembled a giant; he was at least 6’5 and extremely muscular. Good-looking with olive skin and dark hair, he seemed to speak with an Italian or Spanish accent. He looked a bit rough, like he had been in a fight or two. He leaned toward the other in a strange way, almost as if he was bowing slightly. Although his eyes were a bit far apart, they were deep brown, with glints of gold, and said something about him, but I couldn’t determine what they might reveal.  
As I watched the two boys walk closer, I eventually noticed the second one, who was almost overshadowed by his friend until he was nearly five feet away. My mouth dropped open as I looked at him. He was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.  
Not usually the type to objectify men, or even notice them at all, my reaction was almost as shocking as his beauty. He had thick, dirty blonde hair that was unkempt in a way that said movie star. He ran his fingers through it slowly, moving it away from his forehead; I could swear it happened in slow motion. He had clear dark eyes, a color almost indefinable. They reminded me of the ocean, aqua at first; but the closer he got the darker they appeared. Suddenly they were turquoise and shining. A straight nose and perfectly full, but masculine lips completed his face. I hardly noticed anything else as I stared stunned and bemused into his eyes, eyes that happened to be staring back into mine.
“Excuse me, Ms. Matthews; you are going to be late for class if you don’t get going. Can you read the map, or are you already lost?” the stern voice of the secretary pulled me out of my stupor.  
“Um, no, I can read,” I said, sheepishly, still unable to take my eyes off the mysterious boy staring back.
“Of course you can read,” she said sharply, snapping my entranced head back to reality. “Now, get to class.”  
This time I obeyed, although hesitantly. I was thankful for my long hair, and let it fall in front of my face, hoping to hide my embarrassment. I could feel my tan cheeks burning with shame. As I started to walk past the eyes that had captured my attention, I began to experience the strangest, but not-so-unfamiliar feeling.  
My skin started to tingle as if I were being shocked a million times; my insides began to grow increasingly warmer until I felt like all of my vital organs were energized from the sun. Instantly my blood began to warm and then rapidly heated to what felt like a strong boil. I picked up my pace and nearly ran out of the double brass doors into the fresh air, trying to catch my breath.  
It was only the end of August, so the sun was still hot and the humidity already overwhelming, despite the early morning hour. I pressed my face against the cool brick of the building, gasping for air and mentally calming my insides.
I realized that I looked ridiculous, but the physical changes that had just begun to occur in my body were usually a sign of pending destruction. Although I had never been sure of why my body suddenly felt like a giant microwave, I could always be positive that it would end in a great travesty. I pressed my face closer to the brick, allowing the shade of the building to cool me, calming the electrical impulses tingling beneath my skin.
I was officially humiliated by my erratic behavior. I was sure I left those inside thoroughly entertained and confused. I was just thankful I was able to stop the electrical build-up in time. 
The first time I felt the electric pulses underneath my skin I thought they were bugs. In the middle of second semester of my freshman year, I thought I had been attacked by a swarm of insects. During gym class, I began to freak out, feeling the creepy-crawly sensation of the electricity building slowly inside of me. I remembered my gym teacher rushing over to my side and then I remember nothing. Supposedly I passed out, but not before screaming something about bugs being everywhere. When I finally woke up, I was outside in an ambulance, surrounded by hazmat guys. Apparently my school had become thoroughly infested with tropical insects, the really big kind. Unfortunately, I had implicated myself in what the school board assumed to be a serious prank, and I was respectfully asked to leave.
 After pleading a pitiful case to the next school, I was allowed to begin my sophomore year on the provision of absolutely no shenanigans. I lasted all the way through the year until finals week when I felt the electrical sensation again. This time I tried to restrain myself and get it under control; I wished only to wash the feeling off. Again I must have blacked out because I woke up to find myself in another ambulance; the school had flooded spontaneously. The school board did not ask so nicely for me to leave; but Aunt Syl forced them to give me passing grades by threatening a lawsuit, since there was no substantial evidence that I caused the flood.
Last week, the beginning of my junior year, I started my third prep school, only to experience what felt like my blood beginning to boil. I was warned it was my last chance to finish high school. Unfortunately for them, no one would be finishing anything at that school, since I magically burned it to the ground.  
I couldn’t explain what happened to me; I just knew better than to mess around. The powers in charge at Kingsley must have been brave souls to allow me entrance into their prestigious prep school, or had taken out an unusually large insurance policy.   
I was just glad I was able to stop it that time. I had never felt the impulses react so strongly. More than a sweeping sense of unconsciousness, the electrical impulses had felt alive, as if they were reacting to something. Who knows what would have happened had I let them continue…. possibly the Apocalypse? I had no idea why those things happened to me, or what exactly they were. I just knew that I was always the one responsible for something catastrophic. And I was seriously hoping to avoid closing this school down for good.  
I turned around, so that my back was to the wall, slid down slowly to the ground, and closed my eyes. I was utterly unconcerned with being late for class after all that; I had bigger things to worry about, like ensuring there was still a class to go to.
I compelled my nerves to calm down, and started slowly to relax. I forced my muscles to loosen up, mentally flexing them. My relaxation only lasted a second, though, as the Administration Building doors burst open. The two boys, from before, exited the building in mid-conversation.  
I prayed they would not notice me and crouched even closer to the wall. I could not have felt more humiliated. Although the gorgeous one did look in my direction, he acted as though he couldn’t see me and continued down the steps.  
“What are we doing here, Talbott?” the one named Kiran demanded, almost growling.  
“Please sir, you know what we are doing here,” Talbott replied, almost too softly to be heard.  
“No, I do not,” Kiran snapped again. “Aren’t there any qualified girls in London? This is ridiculous. I don’t even know where we are. This is the ugliest place I have ever seen. I cannot possibly be expected to spend the next two years of my life here. I want to talk to my father,” his voice had almost turned into a whine, but his accent was so sexy that I hardly noticed.
“There are none in London with her pedigree and power. Your father looked. Your father looked everywhere. And this place is called Omaha…. Nebraska. I’m afraid he will not be moved; this was his idea,” Talbott said humbly but persistently. Although inferior in looks, he certainly seemed to be the more mature of the two.
“This is ridiculous. Where is she?” Kiran looked around himself with such pride and arrogance that I found his beauty quickly fading. Crouching closer to the wall, I could not believe they still hadn’t noticed me.  
“Please calm down. I believe you will meet her soon; but we must get to class now or you will be late on your first day,” Talbott half smiled and started walking in the direction of the academic buildings; Kiran followed slowly behind, arms crossed, looking less god-like and much more child-like.  
I breathed a sigh of relief and slowly stood up. Reluctantly, I collected my papers and adjusted my uniform, which consisted of a navy-blue, pleated skirt and white button-down collared shirt, knee-high navy blue stockings and of course the classic prep school tie: navy-blue with red plaid. I gathered my nerve and headed in the same direction as Talbott and Kiran, already afraid of the rest of my day.


Chapter Two

My thoughts were preoccupied as I walked into class, not realizing that English had already started until I stumbled clumsily through the door. Not only was I starting school a week later than the other students, but I walked loudly into a class that had already started…. awesome. The teacher- a skinny bald man, dressed in a tasteful navy-blue suit and tie- looked up from a textbook and glared at me.
“Why do I even bother to start class when we’re going to have all of these interruptions?” he said, still staring at me.  
“Um, I’m sorry, I’m new,” I replied guiltily, my face turning bright red once again.
“Obviously. Are you Eden?” he asked, speaking through his nose.  
“Um, yes, Eden Matthews,” I clarified, just to be sure, but obviously he knew that. I could barely contain my nerves. Usually a shy person, I hated having the attention on me, and at that moment, the entire class was staring, probably laughing, at me.
“Nobody’s laughing at you,” the teacher declared unexpectedly. “I’m Mr. Lambert. Welcome to Honors English. Please take a seat over there.” He tried to smile and pointed to the back of the classroom where an empty desk sat between none other than the two boys I encountered earlier…. fantastic.
Although I was oddly reminded by Mr. Lambert that nobody was laughing at me, I still felt all eyes were on me as I walked quickly, head down, to my desk and slid in as quietly as I could. I glanced around the room and realized, thankfully, that no one was looking in my direction; well, no one except Kiran who was sitting directly to my left and staring openly at me. I ran my fingers through my hair, pulling it over my shoulder and in front of my face. I hoped to build a wall of tangled curls to separate me from this curious stranger. 
I fumbled through my backpack looking for the same book that everyone else was holding but I suddenly found it hard to concentrate. My bag was full of books for every class and the covers all began to look the same. My vision blurred, I squinted to give myself a clearer view. I could hear the lecture, but it sounded far off, and I was beginning to feel dizzy. My breath became quick and shallow; I grabbed on to my desk with both hands, trying to find my bearings.
As if from everywhere around me, I started to feel a wave of heat overcome me. My skin began to prickle again as if I were going through a low dose of electroshock therapy and there was a high-pitched sound resonating in my ears. I could feel my head hit the ground as I slid back out of my desk and onto the floor.
“Good grief, I’m never going to get through this lecture,” sighed a very exasperated voice, I wondered what a nasal-sounding man was doing in my bedroom while I was trying to sleep.
“What did you do? This kind of thing is strictly prohibited, Mr. Kendrick. I don’t care who you are. You will obey your father’s ordinances when you are in my class,” the aggravated voice kept going on and on. I thought, “Just let me sleep!”
“I didn’t do anything!” a familiar English accent defended himself. Where had I heard that voice before? “I don’t know what happened to her, she just fell over!”  
“Ms. Matthews, Ms. Matthews, can you hear me?” It was the annoying voice again. I could hear him, but I didn’t want to; I wanted to go back to sleep.
Then it hit me. Oh no! I did it again. Well, I didn’t know what I did again, but I was too afraid to open my eyes and find out. Strong, small hands gripped my shoulders and began to shake me roughly.
“Maybe you should slap her,” a high-pitched girl’s voice offered. That got my attention.
“What have I done now?” I groaned, closing my eyes even tighter. I refused to open them and assess the damage I just caused. I also refused to be slapped, I wasn’t unconscious anymore.
“You fainted,” the English accent that I could now identify as Kiran’s said plainly. I thought I could also detect a smile in his voice and maybe something else…. amusement?
“What else?” I groaned again.
“What do you mean what else? Well, you’ve also interrupted my class,” Mr. Lambert’s unmistakably irritated voice replied impatiently. “What’s wrong with you, do you need to go to the nurse?”
I finally summoned enough courage to open my eyes. The world around me was perfectly intact, perfectly as it should have been and I was completely confused. This wasn’t the first time I had awoken in a daze after experiencing similar feelings. This was just the first time I had awoken to things still normal around me. Usually, it was all mass panic and chaos, due to lethal insects or flooding waters, or even scorching flames. Truthfully, I much preferred a crowd of confusion. I was inwardly overjoyed there wouldn’t be mass lawsuits and a new school in my near future.  
“No, I am fine, thank you,” I think I was actually smiling on the outside now too, because the entire class of faces staring down at me were more confused than ever. If only they had known what could have happened to them; if only they had known that miraculously their lives were saved. I could feel my smile get bigger and I knew without a doubt that I looked crazy.
I tried to push myself up onto my elbows, but was still a little shaky and fell back down. A nervous, almost hysteric laugh escaped me and it was the only sound in the room. I had officially begun my first day at my new school as a freak. A swarm of students stared down at me, a sea of white and navy-blue, with islands of hanging red plaid ties.  
I decided to try to sit up again; I needed to move since everyone was still gawking at me. As I struggled, I could see that Kiran and Talbott, closest to me due to the proximity of their desks, attempted to help me. I watched as their arms reached out to grab mine and assist me in sitting up. As soon as their skin touched mine, I started all over again with the heat and electricity and I let out a mild scream.  
Both sets of arms immediately dropped from mine and I found myself back on the floor, wishing I were dead. I had no idea what was going on, but I soon realized that everyone staring at me wanted an explanation. I wished I had one to give them; one that wouldn’t completely brand me as nuts.
“Maybe I should go to the nurse,” I conceded as I struggled to get up once again. I could see both sets of arms reaching out to help me in another attempt of chivalry and I overreacted a little by shouting, “That’s Ok, I can do it on my own!”  
I knew that I sounded like a lunatic, like certifiably crazy; but for whatever reason these two boys were bringing out the scariest part of me and I didn’t want them or anyone else to get hurt. I looked up at Kiran apologetically, but instead of looking concerned for this crazy person, like I expected, he just gazed back entertained, almost like he was about to laugh.  
“Can someone help Ms. Matthews to the Nurse’s Office, please?” Mr. Lambert sounded exasperated.
“I can,” Kiran volunteered.
“No, that’s all right,” I blurted out; for fear that I’d faint again. “I’m sure I can find it on my own,” I gave a weak smile, but finally stood up. I actually had no intention to find the nurse, I just needed to calm down and get some space. I grabbed the back of my chair to steady myself, and inhaled deep breaths of air.  
“Lilly, can you take her?” Mr. Lambert turned to look at a fragile-looking girl with short, vibrant, red, curly hair.  
“Sure,” she answered sweetly. She took a few steps from the back of the crowd of students to wait for me by the door.  
I grabbed my backpack, terrified to look at anyone until I was almost to the safety of the hallway. Once I reached the door, I took a brave look back only to see Kiran smile and wink at me from his desk. This had been the most bizarre day, and, unfortunately, it wasn’t even the end of first hour.


Chapter Three

Once the door closed behind me, I headed straight to the nearest bathroom. Kingsley was a school for the privileged; the girl’s bathroom reflected this. The stalls, sinks and hand dryers were all made of the latest bathroom technology and porcelain, I guessed. The mixture of class and technology seemed a little strange, especially in a bathroom. Conveniently, there was a plush sitting room adjoined where I could hide my shame in private.  
I plopped down on the nearest divan, pulling my knees to my chest. I rested my head in my hands and let out an audible groan. What was wrong with me?
“Ugh. What is wrong with me?” I echoed loudly. 
“Is there something wrong with you?” a soft, sweet voice asked. I had forgotten all about the girl who was supposed to take me to the Nurse’s Office. I would have rather not had an audience during my impending breakdown, but it was a little late to think up an excuse now.  
“It seems like it,” I looked up and gave her a small smile. She was pretty, with bright green eyes and clear, pale skin. She was shorter than me, maybe 5’6 or 5’5, and had impeccable posture; which I was sure, was a sign of her upbringing. I expected her to look back at me as if I was crazy, but to my surprise, she only looked concerned. Her forehead had creased in worried lines and her plump red lips were pressed together in a frown.
“What happened back there?” She sat down beside me and waited for an answer. At least she hadn’t tried to console me by assuring me everything was Ok. We both knew everything was not Ok. She sounded genuinely concerned though, and I was suddenly grateful not to be alone.  
“I wish I knew. Sometimes I just, uh, faint,” I knew it was a weak explanation, but I didn’t think she would believe me if I told her that sometimes I felt my body turn into a giant microwave. “I am a freak show; I was kind of hoping to avoid drawing that much attention to myself today…. or like ever,” I started to laugh; this was absurd.          
“I’m Lilly Mason, by the way. And I know exactly what you mean,” she thankfully didn’t ask for more of an explanation, but I was one hundred percent positive that she had no idea what I meant.
“Nice to meet you,” I said with a genuine smile. “Thank you for volunteering to help me. I know that you didn’t have to, but I would have just died if Kiran witnessed anymore of my meltdown.” I rolled my eyes, expecting her to understand.
“Oh, do you know him?” Her question caught me off guard because clearly I was new to this school.
“No, not at all. I don’t know anyone here. I ran into him in the Administration Building.”  
“That’s so strange. He’s new today, too.” The worry lines reappeared on her forehead.
“Why is that strange?” I remembered that Talbott was worried about Kiran being late on his first day. But if he was new too, then why would he offer to take me to the Nurse’s Office?
“Well, Kingsley doesn’t usually allow anyone to start classes late, let alone three students in one day. I can understand Kiran Kendrick, but why did they let you in?” Her question could be taken offensively, but the way she asked it seemed only curious. Her voice was so pure; and her eyes so innocent, that I could hardly believe this girl could ever have a hurtful thought about anyone.
“I’m not sure, actually. I’m not what you would call the ideal student,” I confessed with a cynical smile, but offered no explanation to my statement. I wanted at least one friend in this place; admitting that I was practically a ticking time bomb seemed like the wrong way to make one. “You said three students, who is the other one?”  “Talbott Angelo. He was sitting on the other side of you.” Lilly started blushing as soon as she said the word “Talbott.” Her cheeks turned a crimson red against the pallid tone of the rest of her skin, yet somehow it enhanced her beauty instead of diminishing it.
I gave her a slightly knowing smile. I had barely noticed Talbott, other than his size and stature, yet, Kiran’s blazing blue eyes flooded my memory. I couldn’t help but blush too, as I thought about his perfect features and the way he seemed amused at my discomfort. I should have been offended, or at least irritated, but I couldn’t blame him. 
Instead of being offended, I was more embarrassed at my body’s reaction to any close approximation to him. First, I stared unabashedly; then I acted clumsy and erratic. Next I had physical reactions that no one could explain and eventually I fainted.  Clearly I needed a class on how to behave in the presence of the opposite sex, which I was sure they offered here at the prim and proper prep school I now attended.   
The bell rang in the hallway, and we started to gather our things. I noticed that Lilly was wearing the best of every designer imaginable, which was hard to do considering we all wore the same, plain uniform. But her book bag was designer, her shoes were designer, and what little jewelry she was wearing screamed expensive. I looked down at the backpack I had carried since junior high and laughed at its…. um…. wear and tear.
I stopped to glance at myself in the mirror. My black eyeliner was smudged in the corner of my eyes, but I didn’t bother to fix it. I probably had laid it on a little too thick to begin with; I had been in a hurry this morning. The black from the eyeliner matched the color of my dark eyes, making the white of the pupil appear almost neon. I grabbed my pink lip-gloss out of my pocket and applied it quickly, unsure of the reason behind it.
“What is your next class?” Only Lilly's clothes screamed snob. Her demeanor and voice were so sweet that I doubted she belonged at a place like this.
“Um, Drama with Mrs. Woodsen,” I replied, looking at the class list Mrs. Truance handed me earlier.
“Oh, good, I have that too. Hopefully we’ll have most classes together,” Lilly smiled again and I could tell that she was truly happy we had the same class. I already felt relaxed now that I had a friend or at the very least someone who didn’t utterly hate me; the rest of the day didn’t seem so impossible.
We left the restroom and entered the throng of students hurrying to their next classes. We joined them, and Lilly took me through a winding hallway to a set of beautiful marble stairs, leading both up and down. The English and Arts Building of Kingsley was another red brick building, but much larger than the Administration Building.  
Located on the first floor were the theater and dressing rooms; there was also a lavish foyer and an elegant, marble staircase that led up to the second and third floors. All other grade levels of English, honors or non-honors, were located on the second floor. The third floor was dedicated entirely to the Drama department.
Although this floor had many small rooms assigned to storage and props, the majority of the floor was taken up by a large, unusual drama studio. There were no desks or white-boards in the room. The room glowed with paint in effervescent colors: oranges, and reds, greens and blues; beautiful silk floor pillows were scattered around the room. Oriental room dividers stood in one corner, suggesting a dressing room, while various props and costumes cluttered together in another corner.
An exotic but frazzled looking woman stood in the front of the room, holding her hands wide, welcoming us into her classroom. The woman, whom I assumed to be Mrs. Woodsen, the Drama teacher, had frizzy, unkempt dark black hair and leather-like skin that suggested years and years in the sun, as she seemed to be in her late fifties.  
She was wearing a deep purple kimono, with vibrant red dragons embroidering its floor length silk. Around her wrists were dozens of golden bangle bracelets that jingled with every small movement she made.  
This teacher, who seemed more than human, transfixed me as I took a seat on the floor like everyone else. I had noticed that although the room would suggest chaos and confusion, all of the students entered the room silently and took their respective places on the floor. I sat close to Lilly, not sure whether to be terrified of what was to come next, or excited.  
“Hello, my darlings,” Mrs. Woodsen's voice purred her hello. As I looked at her thick eyeliner and dark red lipstick, she reminded me of a cat, or an Egyptian, or maybe an Egyptian cat.  
“I understand we have new actors to join this vivacious cast today,” she slowly moved her eyes to mine and held my attention for a few seconds before searching out Kiran and Talbott. I was horrified when I realized they were in this class as well, but as I looked around, I noticed that I recognized most of the students from English were here. “So before we begin our work with the one-acts, I would like for each of these newcomers to introduce themselves and enlighten us on their unique personas.”  
I was mortified; surely she didn’t expect me to speak in front of this entire class of people. Not to mention the fact that almost all of this entire class of people witnessed the only unique thing about me already this morning. Thankfully, Talbott stood up first. I tried my best to shrink into a ball of nothing.
“Well, I am Talbott Angelo,” he said in a strong, authoritative voice, his accent thick, making his words run together. “I am new to this place and this school. I come from London with Kiran. I hope to enjoy America very much,” he gave a goofy smile and laughed a little, along with the rest of the class. He waited for Kiran to stand before he took his seat back on the floor. His huge frame seemed too big among the other, smaller-framed girls that had surrounded him. 
“Welcome Talbott, we are so thankful you have been sent to us,” Mrs. Woodsen purred to him. She turned her full attention on Kiran, gazing at him until I was almost embarrassed for her. He was not able to look fully at her face and I noticed a light shade of red creep up the back of his neck.
“My dear Kiran, you don’t have to say anything unless of course you want to,” Mrs. Woodsen’s eyes became glassy with obvious adoration. Yuck.
“No, it’s all right,” he forced his eyes up and gave her a benevolent smile. 
Kiran cleared his throat. His perfect posture and amazing good looks already set him apart from everybody else; but now with him standing and everyone else on the floor it almost seemed as if we were bowing down to him. Thinking that Mrs. Woodsen practically was, I smiled, and then realized Kiran was looking directly at me.
“Hmmm…” he continued to stare at me, while seemingly thinking about what he was going to say. “I am Kiran Kendrick. I am also from London,” Unlike Talbott, Kiran’s accent was light and crisp, making him sound like the perfect English gentleman. “We arrived yesterday. And let’s see…. something unique only to me ….” he was obviously dragging this out on purpose because a mischievous grin began to appear in the corners of his mouth. I found myself impatient with him, despite all of his looks and glory. Then he looked directly at me again, “Well, recently I caught a fainting, young girl, and saved her from imminent danger,” he finished dramatically.  
As his eyes locked with mine so intensely, and since apparently everyone in this class had already been a witness to my episode, all thirty voices burst out in laughter at once. The sound was shrill and mocking and I was once again humiliated.  
“Quiet down my darlings. I apparently am not privy to the joke, so let us calm ourselves and our inner auras so that we may hear from our last new soul,” her calming voice met with immediate success and all voices became silent. Kiran took his seat, but not without giving another roguish wink in my direction. I now found myself extremely irritated with him.  
I struggled to my feet, not nearly as effortlessly as the two boys before me did. I looked around at my seated peers; my mind was blank and my face bright red. The faces staring back were exceptionally beautiful; their eyes unnaturally bright, and their hair unnaturally shiny. They were also exceptionally hostile and judgmental. It was nice to know I had once again been able to isolate and alienate myself just as quickly at this school as at any other.
“Um,” I coughed to clear my voice and found Lilly’s face, the only genial expression in the room. Even Mrs. Woodsen seemed to be eyeing me skeptically. “Um, I am Eden Matthews. I am from here, I mean from Omaha. And I recently fainted in front of my entire first hour class, but I don’t remember anyone saving me from banging my head against the floor,” I finished quickly and quite sarcastically, before plopping down cross-legged next to Lilly, unable to look up or at anyone. I thought for a second that I might come off funny or at least witty, but the deafening silence indicated otherwise. Lilly patted my knee reassuringly, but I was too mortified even to look at her.  
“Well, I do hope you are all right, dear,” Mrs. Woodsen eyed me even more suspiciously before turning her gaze on a few students who had begun to whisper. I looked over to see that it was the girls who had surrounded Kiran and Talbott. They stopped talking after receiving the evil eye from Mrs. Woodsen, but all turned to give me a dirty look. “Unfortunately for those of you who are new, we have already started working on our one-act plays, and the groups have already been chosen. I am afraid you three will have to work together quietly on busywork, until after the One-Act Meet, in a few weeks. I will have you grade papers from the younger classes. Please sit in a group behind the dividers, so that the other students can have room to work on their small masterpieces.”  
At this point, the entire class stood up and moved into their one-act groups. Lilly gave me an encouraging smile and went to stand with her own group. I picked up my backpack and shuffled slowly behind the dividers. This had to be some cruel joke.  Mrs. Woodsen was now officially my least favorite teacher, even worse than Mr. Lambert was. Again, I was reminded that this was only second hour and the day was far from over. I had never regretted burning down a school more than I did at that moment.


Chapter Four

I took my sweet time walking over to the dividers and cringed when I looked behind them and found a tiny sitting area. I stared, mouth agape, wondering how I was going to get through this hour.  
Kiran bumped, purposely, into my shoulder as he walked by and took a seat on the floor directly in the middle of the small space. Talbott followed close behind, although he was careful not to touch me as he entered. I was amazed at how quickly my infatuation with Kiran turned into disgust. Had I known he was going to sell me out in front of everyone, I doubted I ever would have found his faultless features so alluring before.  
Regretfully I took my seat next to Kiran on the floor. I pulled my knees in as close as I could and disdainfully, rested my forehead on them. I gave myself hope that there was a way to avoid these irritating boys in the hole we had been banished to.
“So what are you?” Kiran asked pointedly. I lifted my eyes and found him staring at me intently. Avoidance was clearly out of the question. 
“What do you mean?” I asked dryly. I had lost all patience with him. For the first time I noticed Talbott staring at me, as well.
“What are you?” he asked again, pronouncing each word crisply and clearly. If this was some weird game, I was not in the mood. I laid my head back down on my knees.
“What he means to say is.... which are you?” Talbott interjected, apparently hoping to elicit some type of answer from me; I, however, had no idea what kind of answer they were even looking for. After responding with silence, he continued, “We were not aware of you before we came; are you Witch, or Psychic?”  
My head snapped up in reaction to his ridiculous question. I saw then that they were just playing another joke on me. How irritating. I was speechless, and my temper was slowly rising. I may have made a fool of myself before, but that did not mean these teenage boys needed to continue humiliating me.  
“She’s not one of you?” Kiran tilted his head towards Talbott and asked softly.
“No, not in the least. And I cannot get a read on her. Can you?” Talbott responded just as softly. They spoke to each other as if I was not there and my patience drew thin.  
“No,” Kiran responded, almost as frustrated as I felt. The strangest thing was that they actually maintained a straight face as though they really were serious.
“I’m neither,” I almost laughed as I said it. “I am actually an elf, a Christmas elf. Santa gave me some time off so that I could go to school. He’s such a nice old man,” I rolled my eyes, not just at them, but at myself, I couldn’t believe I was playing their games.
They both laughed a little nervously and looked at each other. Kiran adjusted his sitting position and our legs bumped each other. I couldn’t tell if he did it on purpose or not, but as soon as there was contact between us, I began to feel the prickles and heat like before. It wasn’t intense and my pride promised me I could handle it. There was no reason to panic and flee from the room, at least not yet.
“Where are the papers we are supposed to grade?” I asked Talbott, seeing a large stack of loose-leaf notebook paper in his hand. “Can I have some, please?” I choked out manners, trying to be the better person, although they were making it extremely difficult.
“Talbott will do it,” Kiran answered quickly, without even looking at his friend.
“I would rather grade my share, thank you,” I suddenly felt sorry for Talbott, to have a friend like Kiran, but I shook my head trying to rid myself of the feeling. I needed to remember that he had been just as bad as Kiran. Ok, well maybe not just as bad, but the mere fact that he indulged Kiran put him in the same category.
“Really, Talbott will do them. He’s actually probably already finished,” Kiran insisted. I looked to Talbott but he just smiled. I realized that Talbott was going along with Kiran’s orders happily and was not going to hand over any papers.
“Ugh. Fine,” I resigned.
“Your last name is Matthews?” Talbott asked unexpectedly.  
“Yes,” I was getting tired of this.
“Nothing?” Kiran asked cryptically to Talbott.
“Nothing,” Talbott responded just as cryptically.
“Do you have any questions for me?” I assumed Kiran was talking to Talbott, because I could not think of any nice question that I would have wanted to ask him. Any question I would have asked would surely get me into trouble. “Eden,” he nudged my foot with his; there was instant electricity shooting from my toes up through my leg. “Eden, do you want to ask me anything?” He gave me another one of his impish grins and looked at me with such intensity that I found myself squirming.
“What?  No,” I said with surprise. “I don’t have any questions for you,” I let a little venom slip into my tone, and rolled my eyes again. “Except, why you felt it necessary to act like such an ass before?” I said it before I could stop myself…. I knew whatever I asked would not be kind.
Kiran let out a small laugh, but Talbott started to stand up next to him. His body had become tense and he was in a fighting position. I just stared at him completely confused. I cringed a little and pulled my knees in tighter. The last thing I wanted to do was fight Talbott…. No, sorry, the last thing I wanted to do was apologize to Kiran; maybe it would come to fighting after all, although I thought it was very strange that Kiran’s friend would be so defensive over such a small thing. Maybe they were gay.
“It’s all right Talbott, sit down,” Kiran was still amused, and I guessed it was at my expense.
“She can’t talk to you like that,” Talbott growled. I was amazed at his devotion to Kiran. I found their relationship strange, and felt more uncomfortable than ever. Was he really going to fight me for calling his friend an ass? Truthfully, I could have said a lot worse.  
I sat there silently, sizing them up. If they were gay, then the girls in this class were going to have an unhappy surprise, not to mention poor Mrs. Woodsen. Other than Talbott’s overprotective aggressiveness and his obvious devotion to Kiran, they did not seem like lovers. Maybe Kiran was straight and Talbott was in love with him.  
Kiran suddenly let out a roaring laugh, nearly rolling over in hysteria. I continued to stare at them, more confused than ever. Talbott sat back down, but his face was suddenly bright red. I realized he was having a hard time looking me in the eye. 
“If she is who she says she is, of course she can. Now calm down, you’re not going to fight a human girl just for speaking her mind. I was rude, and for that I apologize,” his voice turned to liquid and he reached out to touch my hand, resting it on top of my knees.
I pulled it away quickly. Both boys turned to look at each other; when Kiran returned his face to mine, I could see that his smile was now carefully controlled. He was frustrated with me. A wave of regret washed over me, and a small tingling of fear ran down my spine. I quickly shook it off. It made no sense to be scared of these bullies; surely, they were just playing another game.
“Don’t be silly Eden, let’s put this all behind us and become great friends,” His voice retained a smooth fluidity, frustrated with me or not.
“You’re right. It is silly,” I thought of a hundred snotty things to say, but in the end, I lost my nerve. “I accept your apology. Thank you.”  
I could see that he wanted to say more, but the bell rang, so I stood up quickly and started to gather my things to leave. Before I could, he reached out his hand to grab my arm gently. A sudden, pulsating electricity overwhelmed me; I willed myself to continue to stand, doing my best not to show any signs of distress.  
“As long as you are who you say you are Eden, I know we can be the best of friends,” he tightened his grip on my arm as if to make a point. As he did, the electricity became stronger. My ears started to ring and my vision blurred, but somehow I managed to respond.
“Let’s just try regular friends first,” my voice was breathy and choked. He took his hand off me and I impulsively gasped for breath, steadying myself with a hand on the partition.  
“Probably a good idea,” he smiled widely and walked passed me, away from the oriental dividers. Talbott followed behind him, carrying the large stack of papers Mrs. Woodsen had asked us to grade.
I panicked slightly, not wanting her first impression of me to be a disappointment. I prepared a small apology in my head and followed the boys, hoping she’d believe my explanation: “They wouldn’t let me grade the papers, but I tried. I promise!” It already sounded weak and I hadn’t even said it aloud yet. However, as I got closer I could see Talbott handing over the papers already.
“Thank you Mr. Kendrick, I hope that I didn’t ask too much of you,” Mrs. Woodsen sounded slightly nervous as she addressed Kiran, although Talbott was the one who handed her the papers.
“Oh, no. Talbott was able to handle them just fine. I have to expect this sort of thing now that I am Stateside, I suppose. I will grow used to it. This way of life is just very unfamiliar to me,” Kiran smiled generously at Mrs. Woodsen and then turned on his heel to leave.  
I was shocked at his arrogance. His behavior made my stomach turn and I forgot all about his good looks. He was a completely despicable person. Who did he think he was talking to a teacher like that? Or talking about us….Americans? The Midwest might be different from jolly old England, but it was just fine for the rest of us, thank you very much. Clearly, he suffered from some sort of deranged class prejudice. My only hope in surviving the day was to manage to avoid him completely.
I searched out Lilly and saw her waiting for me by the door. I rushed over to her, thankful again to be in her calming presence. Her cheeks flushed as she scrunched her hair nervously with one hand.  
“How was your One-Act practice?” I asked, trying to be as nonchalant as possible. I just wanted to forget all about my own hour of hell.
“Oh fine. I mean…. I am not very good at this kind of thing, so I always get nervous, even in practice. I know I’ll just die when we get to the real competition,” she tried to laugh it off, but I could tell that she was seriously unnerved.
“I’m sure you’re great.” I said, trying to encourage her. I actually had no idea what she was like, but any compliment felt good. I hoped that she was great; she deserved to be great.  
“Thank you,” she smiled, slightly more confident. “What was your hour like?”  
“Ugh…. terrible. I cannot stand those boys!” I vented, a little more frustrated and a little louder than I would have liked. Her eyes dropped to the floor, and her expression became instantly strained.
“Now, now Eden, you promised we would be friends,” Kiran chided me softly. He walked closer toward us, with Talbott following loyally behind. Maybe Talbott was a dog in his former life.  
I immediately turned and walked out of the classroom. I had no idea where I was supposed to go next, but that didn’t stop me from a fast escape. Thankfully, Lilly followed speedily behind me, although I could tell she was embarrassed of my behavior.  
“Do you know what your next class is?” Lilly asked, a little out of breath from the quickness of my step. I could hear the boys following closely, so I picked up the pace even faster.
“I think French. Is that in this building too?” I needed a direction; I needed to get away from the golden boy and his golden retriever. 
“No, it’s not; it’s in the History and Language building across campus. But I can take you, since I have Latin this hour,” I was so grateful for Lilly Mason at that moment I could have just hugged her. I slowed down to a normal walking pace when we reached the marble staircase.
As we descended the steps, Kiran and Talbott took positions on either side of us. I could hear Talbott introduce himself to Lilly; she responded back in a terribly shy and shaky voice. I inwardly winced, imagining all of the horribly rude things Talbott would say to her. But to my surprise, he remained perfectly polite and sounded nearly as nervous as she did. Their voices dropped in volume and I tilted my head to listen in on their conversation.  
“Did you say you had French next?” Kiran’s languid accent pulled me out of my eavesdropping; I found myself relaxing a little.
“Um, yes. Why? Don’t tell me you have that next as well?” Was this school playing some kind of sick joke on me?
“Yes, I do, actually. It looks as if we are destined to be together,” his grin was back and I hoped that he was only kidding. I replied with a forced smile of my own.
“Does everyone in our class have French?” I realized that he was new too, but for some reason everyone seemed to know him already.
“No, I don’t think so. I think that French is a last resort for us latecomers. The other language classes must have been filled,” his accent was alluring, and I had to remind myself forcibly what kind of person he really was.
We exited the building and found ourselves in the warm sunshine. I hadn’t realized how damp and chilly the building was, until I could feel the sun on my skin. I breathed in the fresh air. I pulled my thick hair off my neck and let the gentle, but humid wind blow through it.  
I closed my eyes, hiding them from brilliant light of the morning sun. Lilly had led us out of the building through what appeared to be a back entrance. We were standing in a courtyard surrounded by identical brick buildings on every side. The beautiful campus felt more worthy of a university atmosphere than a horrible preparatory school.
“There you two are! I have been looking all over for you,” a girl’s smooth, but unfamiliar voice forced me to open my eyes and meet yet another student of Kingsley.
“Hello, Seraphina.” Kiran’s voice was all honey again as he addressed the girl approaching us. She was tall, even taller than I was; probably 5’10. Her long, thick, blonde hair bounced gently as she walked and her clear, unblemished skin almost glistened in the sun light. Her cherry-red lips were pursed and her cobalt blue eyes squinted, making a face that was less than happy. If it weren’t for the expression on her face, she could have been a model walking down the runway.
“Hello,” she said, careful to pronounce each syllable. “What is taking you so long?” she gave a disinterested look in my direction, and without waiting for an answer from Kiran, looked at me and declared, “You’re the girl who fainted.”  
“Good memory,” I responded sarcastically. I started to walk away, dragging Lilly with me when Kiran interrupted our getaway.
“These lovely girls were just showing us to our next class,” we stopped moving and turned to look at him. I noticed Lilly’s bee-stung lips formed in the exact “Oh” formation mine were.
“How nice of them,” Seraphina slid her stick thin arm through Kiran’s, suggesting some kind of claim she had on him. For the first time I noticed how similar they looked; they could have almost been twins. Despite my disgust for Kiran, and now, Seraphina, I couldn’t ignore the tightening in my stomach that felt something like jealousy.


Chapter Five

Welcoming all students and guests, the Administration Building sat in the front of hexagonally-shaped Kingsley. But leading out from either side of the building was a stone pathway connecting all six buildings. A large grassed courtyard surrounded a tall, brick, bell tower. The same dark, red brick architectural style dominated the buildings at Kingsley.
The English and Theatrical building was placed on the far northeast side of campus, and the History, Language and Arts building was placed on the southeast side. The walk along the brick path was short; we just had to pass the Gymnasium to get to it.
Green grass, green trees, and flowers still in bloom, embellished the beautiful campus. I would have loved to walk this alone, and take it all in slowly. 
Unfortunately, I was not alone. I was forced to walk to French not only with Lilly and Talbott, who couldn’t keep their eyes off each other, but with my new best friends Seraphina and Kiran as well. And to my ultimate disdain, Seraphina could not keep her hands off of Kiran, I realized this shouldn’t bother me, and I hated that it did.  
The walk was short however, and soon we had all climbed yet another marble staircase to find ourselves on the second floor of the H and L building. I glanced at Lilly who pointed me in the direction of French.
I entered into another class that had already begun; I was apparently unable to get to class on time today. A young, sophisticated, teacher glanced back from the chalkboard to glare at me. Her short, cropped, black hair was the same color as her short, cropped, black skirt suit. She wore bright, red lipstick and dark-rimmed glasses. She reminded me of something out of a bad adult film.  
“Vous etes en retard,” although she was speaking French, her irritated tone did not escape me.  
“I’m sorry. I’m new,” I tried in English. I had never had a French class in my life. At my previous schools I took Spanish; but that was not even offered at this school and, so I was stuck with French because it was the only open class. Aunt Syl promised me it was very similar to Spanish, but after what Kiran said, I was sure it was the last available space.
“Excusez-nous s'il vous plaît. C'est toute ma faute,” Kiran and Talbott finally made their way through the door behind me and of course, Kiran took the initiative to introduce himself to the teacher; and it appeared he was speaking in perfect French, although I had no clue what he was saying.
“Il n'y a pas de problème," the adult-film-school-dropout responded to Kiran in the most pleasant voice. She had completely transformed from the woman who spoke to me only seconds earlier, to another adoring fan of our one and only Kiran.
“Eden, you look confused,” she turned her to me, and although she was not completely rude, she was not friendly either. Her English was marked by an unmistakably French accent. I wondered cynically if Kingsley had all of their language teachers directly flown in.
“I’m sorry, I just, um, I don’t speak French. I’ve only taken Spanish,” I tried to look as apologetic as possible, while wondering silently if you could be kicked out of this school just for irritating the bejeezus out of every teacher.
“Cela ne peut pas être?” she said again in French, shaking her head. “Why would they put you in this class if you cannot speak the language?” Without waiting for an answer, she continued. “Well, you are just going to have to learn. I refuse to dumb down my curriculum because one student is ignorant.” 
She looked at me as if she expected me to fight her on this. I didn’t expect her to “dumb” down the class either. Although, I thought she could have said it in a nicer way; but that was what I had come to expect of this school, of its teachers, and of its students. I just kept looking at her in the same apologetic way as before.
“Well, I suppose the best way for you to catch up is by full immersion. I am Ms. Devereux. We speak only French in this class, and although I will give you some grace, I expect you to catch up quickly. You will need a tutor as soon as possible. You will sit at my desk, until I feel you are ready for a partner. Go quickly,” she waved her arm in the direction of the teacher’s desk and didn’t give me another look. “Kiran and Talbott, I am so glad you have chosen this class. Please sit down anywhere,” she spoke her instructions so quickly and with such a thick accent, I had trouble understanding, but I did as she told me.  
I took my seat at her desk and pulled out my French books. I knew that I was the center of attention and again felt completely humiliated sitting in the front of the class, all eyes staring at me. Worst of all, Kiran was barely able to contain his laughter.
I opened my books and forced my eyes on to the page. Even the introduction was written in French. I rolled my eyes and groaned inwardly, while Ms. Devereux spoke rapidly in a language I was afraid would be the reason I would never graduate from high school. All of the students answered her questions without missing a beat; including Kiran whose flawless French rivaled even Ms. Devereux’s.  
I tried to avoid staring at him the entire class, but found myself glancing in his direction more than I would have liked to admit. Every time I looked up from my book, I found him staring back, making me blush for reasons I couldn’t understand. I thought I found him completely horrible?  
The class flew by; I spent most of the hour just trying to find words in the book that I heard spoken in class, although I was sure not one French word was spelled phonetically. It appeared that all of the students could already speak French fluently, and Ms. Devereux was out of her mind if she thought that I would ever be able to catch up.  
When the bell finally rang, Ms. Devereux lectured me again on the importance of finding a tutor quickly. But as the entire class was gone by now, I didn’t see that happening today. Kiran and Talbott were the only two people I recognized in that class and I’d be damned before I asked either of them.
I found history on the third floor of the same building and realized that except for French, the same people were in all of my classes so far. This had to be the entire junior class. I had been hoping to meet new people, to be given a second chance at proving I was not the idiot everyone in my class thought I was. But it didn’t look like I would get that opportunity.  
Thankfully, Lilly saved me a seat and I took it, grateful once again that she was willing to be my friend. Mr. Emerson, my “A History of Europe” teacher, was an elderly man, with an all-white beard and all white-hair. He did not even bother to acknowledge Kiran, Talbott, or me, which actually surprised me. He was so far my favorite teacher, although I couldn’t admit that he did much teaching.  
We spent the entire hour listening to him drone on and on, not once looking up from his lecture notes. His voice was a gruff monotone that I found very hard to listen to.  I struggled to take notes, but noticed that most of the students were either sleeping on their desk or passing notes back and forth.
Several of them ended up on Kiran’s desk, and I observed his smug smirk after he read each of them. I could only imagine the important messages the girls in this class found necessary to send him. Talbott had his fair share of notes as well, although he had abstained from reading a single one. All the while, Mr. Emerson was oblivious to it all.    
The bell rang, and we were off to lunch. The cafeteria was located exactly one building over from the Administration Building. Only seniors were allowed to take lunch in the courtyard, and as Lilly and I walked back across campus, we couldn’t help but feel jealous. They sat basking in the sunlight, and again I noticed that all of them, without exception, were extremely beautiful. The same characteristics that defined my class, defined them as well, uniquely bright eyes and flowing hair. They all seemed to be ready for a photo shoot despite the drab Kingsley uniforms.
Lilly and I walked slowly behind the mob of juniors in front of us, watching the other students gather around Kiran aggressively. Talbott stood close to him as if to protect him from the overzealous girls. The seniors, who had thus far ignored the passing underclassmen, seemed just as enthralled with him as all of the others. Several of the girls and boys stood up and approached him, shaking his hand and taking pictures with their cell phones. These people were seriously delusional.  
The cafeteria was more like a great hall, with long, thick, oak tables set up all over, than a typical lunchroom. I turned to Lilly for direction, but her blushing red face looked down at the ground. We hadn’t talked since we left the other building, and I couldn’t imagine what had upset her. I wondered if she was just as astounded over the scene in the courtyard as I was.
“Are you ok?” I asked, trying to be as nonchalant as possible.
“Um, it’s just that, well, I don’t usually sit with anyone else at lunch,” her voice quivered slightly. She was embarrassed because she assumed I would think less of her. However, I couldn’t have been more thrilled at the news.
“Oh thank God!” I blurted out. We both immediately started laughing and got in line for lunch.  
After picking our way through the large buffet-like selection of food, which resembled more of a Thanksgiving feast than cafeteria food, we found an isolated table and took our seats. I looked around at the lunchroom full of people, sitting together in their own respective cliques. I noticed that Kiran and Talbott found a table near the middle of the room surrounded by girls, including Seraphina and several seniors, all giving Kiran their undivided attention.
“So what’s the deal with that girl from earlier?” I tried to sound casual.
“Which girl?” Lilly looked up from her apple.
“The one that could be Kiran’s twin,” I mumbled, allowing the sarcasm to drip into my tone. I was embarrassed by the pang of jealousy punching me in the stomach.
“Oh, that girl,” Lilly rolled her eyes and took another bite of apple. “Well, her name is Seraphina Van Curen. Her family has been part of this school forever, like since it opened a thousand years ago,” Lilly was obviously not impressed with her either, and I breathed a sigh of relief.
“Huh,” I said a little distracted, wishing I were brave enough to ask Lilly to spill all of the dirt.
“Apparently Talbott is impressed with her,” Lilly looked over at the table and the blood immediately rushed to her cheeks.
“I don’t think it's Talbott that she’s after,” I said sardonically, hoping to reassure Lilly that Talbott was still available, although I had no idea what she saw in him.
“Those girls are the rest of the girls in our class. The one with short black hair is Adelaide Meyer, and the one wearing all of the diamonds is Evangeline Harris. They and Seraphina, make up the holy trinity,” she rolled her eyes again and I laughed. I’d been in enough high schools to understand the social order of things. “The rest of the girls are just followers, with no minds of their own.”  
“Wonderful,” I mumbled under my breath.
“Just steer clear and they won’t bother you…. most of the time,” she looked down at the table, in a way that hinted they probably bothered her more times than she would like to admit. 
“Well, this is the side of the cafeteria I prefer to sit on,” I smiled at her reassuringly; it could not have been more truthful.  
The bell rang before I finished but we got up to clear our things anyway. I wasn’t sure if I was ready to get back to all of the humiliation. We double-checked to make sure we had the next class together, Calculus, something I was destined to fail at, and made our way to the exit. Mrs. Truance was standing in the doorway eyeing me. Great, the school board had already decided I didn’t fit in and should be expelled promptly.
“Ms. Matthews, Principal Saint would like to see you in his office please; wait here and you can follow me there,” she directed, appearing less than happy to be running this type of errand. I stopped to wait beside her; I waved to Lilly, as she walked by, giving me an apologetic smile. “Mr. Kendrick, please come with me as well.”
Kiran and Talbott approached us with their group of lackeys; Kiran rolled his eyes when he left them. Kiran walked over to us slowly; I noticed his eyes were looking me over approvingly. Unexpectedly, a wave of nausea and a tingle of excitement ran up and down my spine; slowly, but surely, I began to feel the tiny prickles I knew would soon overwhelm me.
“Mr. Angelo, your services will not be needed, unless, of course, you are not able to continue on to class alone?” Mrs. Truance’s snide and demeaning voice addressed Talbott, and I couldn’t help but let out a small snicker that got me a very dirty look from everybody.
Mrs. Truance turned on her heel and stalked off toward the Administration Building. I allowed Kiran to pass, and followed in step behind them. What had I done now?


Chapter Six

The Principal’s Office, located on the second floor of the Administration Building, was accessed by a stairway right inside the front door. I had not noticed it when I entered the building earlier in the morning. The small and slightly winding stairway triggered a claustrophobic sensation as I followed Kiran, who was following Mrs. Truance, to the second floor. 
The small pricks I felt while near the cafeteria grew stronger in the small space, and I was getting very uncomfortable. The electrical pulses buzzed inside of me; my blood was slowly rising to a boil. This was a different kind of an energy that I felt I could manage. Struggling to contain myself, I tried to place the energy into a specific area of my body. My hands trembled. I clenched and unclenched my fists, struggling to gain control. The stronger the electricity grew, the more I could control it, so the logical place for me to concentrate was on my hands. As I did this, the collective energy rushed down through my body into my fingers. I experienced the electricity through my palms and fingertips, almost as if I was holding it.  
By that point, we exited the stairway and entered onto the second floor. Teachers' offices surrounded us on either side of the hallway. At the end of the long corridor stood the Principal’s Office with a gold nameplate that read “Dr. Amory Saint.”  
Now that the energy saturated my hands, it felt too much for me. My entire body shook from the force, and I struggled to contain the power of it. I had no idea what that meant; all I knew was that I wanted these people to continue thinking I was a normal teenage girl, especially if I was on my way to plead my case.  
Two potted ferns sat on either side of Principal Saint’s doorway. As we approached, I thought of the logical thing to do, although, in reality, this entire experience lacked any kind of logic. As casually as possible, I pointed my hands in the direction of one of the pots and let the energy go. This seemed the only natural course, although I was unsure of what prompted me to do it.
A bright light shot from my hands, and to my shock and horror, the potted plant exploded. Dirt, leaves, and shards of ceramic flew everywhere. I let out a loud scream and stopped dead in my tracks. That was not at all what I had expected to happen.  
My body stopped shaking; the electricity was gone. I felt wonderful, the best I had felt in years. It was as if whatever had built up inside of me and caused all those terrible things to happen was finally gone. I let out a small smile of triumph.  
My elation however, only lasted a second. Thoroughly proud of myself, and realizing how good I felt, I looked up to see that not only Kiran, but also Mrs. Truance, were covered in dirt and leaves.  
Mouths tightly closed, mimicking each other, they turned around to look at me, and waited for an explanation. Mrs. Truance’s burgundy suit and her glasses, covered in grime, were completely worthless. She let out an angry sigh, spewing dirt from her lips. Kiran’s dirty blonde tussles, turned black from dirt; white dust and shrapnel from the ceramic covered him from head to toe. I held back a laugh when I noticed a fern leaf resting precariously on the top of his head.
“Oh, my gosh. That was the weirdest thing I have ever seen! Are you guys Ok?  What happened?” Words and lies rushed out of my mouth. Feeling ridiculous, I just prayed they bought it.  
“You did this,” Kiran glared at me, angrily and accusingly.
“How could I have possibly done that?” I laughed aloud, hoping to pass myself off as incredulous. I sounded more hysterical than anything. “I was way back here. How could I have done that?”
“Mag-” Kiran started.
“Oh my, must have been a prank,” Mrs. Truance interrupted Kiran. “Those nasty little underclassmen are always pulling stunts like this.” She physically pushed him out of the way of the office door. “Mr. Kendrick, go clean up. Ms. Matthews, since you are unscathed you will see Dr. Saint first.” Her voice, void of emotion, confirmed that she didn’t believe a word she had just said. I doubted Kiran did either.  
I followed the direction of her pointed finger and entered Principal Saint’s office. Small bits of dirt and ceramic littered the floor; I was careful to walk over them.
“Close the door behind you,” a deep, sophisticated voice ordered me.  
I obeyed, moving the debris out of the way with the sliding door. The door closed with a final click as I turned to look at the man who had spoken.  
Dr. Amory Saint, a man in his late fifties; his dark, almost black hair complemented his even darker eyes. He was handsome, or maybe more distinguished than handsome; but either way he seemed to be a man that got things done. He actually resembled one of the bad guys in a James Bond movie.  
“Please sit down, Ms. Matthews,” He pointed to one of two, elegant leather, sitting chairs opposite his large, mahogany desk. Again, I did as I was told.
“Welcome, Eden. May I call you Eden?” I nodded my head, afraid to make a sound. I never felt more intimidated and I wasn't sure if it was because of the thousands of books lining every available wall space and cluttering the gigantic, opposing desk, or if it was because I knew this man held my fate in his hands.
“I hope you are making yourself at home in our humble school,” he looked to me again, and I nodded, although I would have called Kingsley anything but humble. “That’s good…. I wanted to check in with you, just to see how you are adjusting,” Here he looked to me and paused; I could tell he was waiting for a verbal response.
“Um, yes, I’m adjusting, um, just fine. Thank you,” I stammered.
“That’s good.” he repeated. “And everything is to your liking?” again he waited for me to respond.
“Yes, everything is just fine,” I managed a small smile, hoping that maybe if this wasn’t a meeting to expel me, then I could go.
“So nothing strange has happened to you today? Nothing out of the ordinary?” his face remained perfectly calm, but I began to panic.  
“What do you mean?” I asked in a barely audible voice.
“I apologize if I’ve confused you. I just want to make sure everything is going smoothly on your first day here. It is my job to make sure every student feels well-adjusted,” he smiled calmly, waiting again for my response. Was this some kind of test?
“Everything’s fine,” I blurted out. “If you mean the plant, I mean what happened in the hallway; Mrs. Truance said that it was just a prank. I didn’t do it. It wasn’t my fault. I don’t know what came over me this morning, I didn’t mean to faint. I’m sorry, it won’t happen again. I guess I was nervous and….” he cut me off with a shake of his hand.
“Calm down, please. I didn’t mean to upset you, I was simply inquiring about your first impressions of Kingsley. You may go now,” he motioned towards the door and I got up quickly to leave. With my hand on the doorknob, he stopped me again. “Oh, Eden, one more thing, please don’t hesitate to speak with me if something is on your mind.”  
Dr. Saint’s last comment caught me off guard and I hurried through the door, feeling very uncomfortable. I felt the anxiety growing inside of me, along with the electrical pulses. I was so concentrated on his last words that I was not paying attention to where I was going and ran face-first into the chest of none other than Kiran.  
I looked up to apologize, but something happened when our entire bodies met. Quicker than I realized, the electrical pulses seized my whole body causing stronger and more painful sensations than anything I had experienced before. As a gut reaction I forced them out of myself just like I did before, only this time, their target was not a potted plant, but Kiran.
Kiran suddenly flew through the air and across the hallway. The strong impulses that exited my hands hit poor Kiran directly in the chest. He landed fifteen feet away on his back looking up at me. I stood there shocked, completely unharmed. At least he didn’t explode.
“What the hell was that for?” he demanded, scrambling to his feet and rushing over to confront me.
“I, um, I have no idea. Um, I am really sorry,” I was mortified; there was no way, I could ever explain that to him.  
“How dare you!” he yelled at me. I hung my head, not having a clue how I could make any logical excuse for my behavior.  
“Mr. Kendrick, please come into my office,” Dr. Saint, standing in his doorway, remained calm. 
“Did you see what just happened?” Kiran shouted incredulously.
“What I saw, was an accidental collision. Ms. Matthews meant no harm, nor did she do it maliciously. In fact, I already heard her apologize to you. Now, please, come in to my office.” We both stood there, staring at Principal Saint. “If you please, Mr. Kendrick,” he asked again with less patience. Dr. Saint opened his arm wide, directing Kiran beyond his office door.
Shaking his head, Kiran walked by me, and as I made my way back down the hallway towards the staircase, I heard Kiran shout, “Who is she, Amory?” before Dr. Saint closed the door behind him.


Chapter Seven

Knowing at any moment he could demand the explanation I could not give him, I survived the rest of the day hiding from Kiran. To my surprise, he appeared to avoid me as well.  
All of my extra “energy” was gone for right now, and I was able to relax. Because of Kingsley's full, eight-period day, the afternoon dragged on. Lilly and I sat together in most of our remaining classes. Thankfully, our other classmates preferred to ignore us.
I understood why they wanted to avoid me; I was fully aware that I was a total freak. But I didn’t understand why Lilly had no other friends. She was drop-dead gorgeous and completely sweet, yet all of the other girls in the class acted as if she didn’t even exist. Only the teachers talked to her and even they seemed to do it out of necessity. The exception was Talbott, who found any excuse necessary to say something to her. Maybe the other girls were just jealous.    
All of my teachers, demanding and irritable without exception, appeared to hate their profession in some unexplainable way. They showed favoritism to a select group of students; but no surprise, it happened to be the Seraphina-Kiran crowd. Oh well, I’d never been much of an honor student.  
The students were the real enigma. They gravitated around Seraphina as if she were the sun. Even her supposed friends, Evangeline and Adelaide reverently worshiped her. So, it shouldn't have been surprising to me that Kiran and Talbott were victims to her gravitational pull. It was disgusting really.
The constant flipping of her long, blinding-blonde hair and the incessant giggling were enough to make me want to burn down this school as well. If it weren’t for Lilly, I would have never made it through the day.  
It was as though we were made to be friends, and similarly made to be outcasts. I wondered what she did before I came; and then I realized probably the same thing I did at all of my other schools: sit alone, stand alone, and eat alone.  
Lilly could have been my exact opposite. She didn’t have to fill in the silence with needless conversation, like I did, but didn’t seem annoyed if I babbled on and on either. I lashed out at anyone who gave me a dirty look, but even though other kids bothered her, Lilly's sweet demeanor remained unaffected.
Lilly and I said goodbye to each other after our last class, chemistry. She promised to save me a seat in homeroom tomorrow morning. With something now to look forward to, I watched her climb into an elegant, black SUV and drive away. She seemed much too small for the oversized monster truck she was driving and I imagined her barely able to see over the steering wheel.  
Looking around the student parking lot, I realized that everyone drove an elegant, black something or other. All of the cars exhibited class and style; all of the students driving them were obviously born to privilege. The extraordinary colors the students exuded bore a stark contrast to the dark, glossy veneers of their automobiles.  
I wondered if a black car was part of the dress code as Aunt Syl drove up in her cherry red convertible. I smiled widely, happy not to fit in, and jumped in the passenger's seat. As we drove away, I felt slightly embarrassed for being picked up from school, but relieved that we were leaving the looming towers of Kingsley behind us for now.
“How was your day?” Aunt Syl asked, glancing at me from behind her oversized sunglasses. Her shoulder-length hair whipped around her face in the wind, but she barely noticed.  
“Oh, you know,” I sighed, thankful to be on my way home.
“ Actually, I don’t know.” Aunt Syl gave me a longer look, and I realized she was looking for assurance that I would be allowed back tomorrow.  
“Well, I didn’t set anything on fire,” I smirked, keeping the exploding fern episode to myself. Aunt Syl smiled sweetly; she always put up with my sarcasm.
“Well did you make any friends?” she questioned further, very maternally. 
“Um, yeah, one. Her name is Lilly Mason; we sit by each other in most of our classes,” I prayed she wouldn’t ask about the rest of my class; I had no idea what I would tell her.  
“Well, that’s nice,” she paused, glancing at me quickly. “What about the boys?” a mischievous grin flashed across her face, and I couldn’t help but smile too.
“Oh, I don’t know…. There are some good looking boys, but they all seem too immature.” Kiran’s perfect face passed through my mind, but remembering his antics, I shook it out quickly.   
“Sounds like high school to me,” she laughed, “So what do you want to do for dinner?” I realized then, that she was dressed nicely, in a light-blue short-sleeve blouse and black, pencil skirt with killer heels, precariously pressing on the gas. It was a nice change from the doctor’s scrubs she was usually in.  
I sometimes found it hard to believe we were related at all. Aunt Syl, or Dr. Sylvia Matthews, was very tall, very tan, and very blonde. I was naturally tan as well, but only moderately tall. As blonde as her hair was, mine was black. She made me keep it long; she claimed it was something about my natural color and volume being a crime to cut short. I didn't mind; at least I could hide behind it. Likewise, my eyes were black, very black; hers were crystal blue. She looked like the stereotypical California beach babe, and I looked like the Adams family. How we both could be related to my mother was beyond me, but since I’d never even seen a picture of my mother I guess I didn’t really know how it was possible.               
“I’m in the mood for steak,” I sighed whimsically.
“Steak it is. But first, pedis, unless of course you have homework?” Only Aunt Syl would put a pedicure and steak dinner before homework.  
“No, nothing I can’t finish later,” I lied; but honestly who really expected me to learn the entire French language in one night? I looked down at my beloved backpack filled with so many odious books. I had enough homework to last me several weeks; a few hours of procrastinating would not get me any farther behind than I already was.
“Great,” she headed in the direction of her favorite nail salon and I laid my head back against the seat and completely relaxed, for the first time all day.

----

After a pampering spa pedicure, and a giant steak dinner at our favorite Omaha steak house, I sat down to what looked like hours, maybe days, of homework. Aunt Syl had been called to the hospital, as usual; I had the house to myself. Her on-call schedule gave me a lifetime of freedom; I enjoyed the solitude and independence.    
My house, a cozy Tudor style, four bedroom, three bath, sat in the middle of one of the most beautiful neighborhoods in Omaha. All of the houses, built in the same style, looked uniquely different. The tall trees embellished this part of town, and overshadowed most of the houses and streets of our mid-town, Happy Hollow neighborhood.  
Although Aunt Syl made enough as an ER doctor so that we could live almost anywhere in town, she preferred it here, as did I. The neighborhood was safe and since there was only the two of us, we didn’t need anything bigger.    
Sitting at the desk in my room, overlooking the street, I could see my yellow Land Rover looking back at me. I stared back longingly; one day I’d be able to drive it again, hopefully one day soon.  
I was never the child that needed much discipline and Aunt Syl wasn't the type of adult to administer much anyway. I did, however, lose my car after being kicked out of the third prep school; I couldn’t really blame her.  
I rapidly tapped my pencil on the desk, knowing I should get to work, but lacking the will power. I did everything I could to avoid French; but I was running out of options. I did the dishes, even though we ate out. I worked through my yoga DVD twice and I even finished all the other homework I had, which was a considerable amount.  
French was too overwhelming, and after just finishing Calculus, my brain was fried. Besides, I really needed a tutor. A pit began to form in my stomach as I remembered the students in my French class, mentally picking them off one by one. I learned from Lilly during 8th hour Chemistry that French 101 was an underclassmen class, and the majority of the students were freshman. So not only was I unable to function normally at school, I now needed tutoring from a freshman…. awesome.  
I could ask Kiran…. or Talbott. My stomach tightened at the thought of asking either one of them for help. Talbott seemed harmless enough, but his devotion to Kiran was disturbing. The way he followed Kiran around and could be so protective of him was not normal. I thought of Lilly and hoped that eventually his loyal energy transferred to her.  
That left Kiran. Barring the fact that he wouldn’t talk to me again after I threw him down the hallway with my inexplicable electrical powers, we didn't exactly get along. Something about him both excited me and terrified me.  
With swirling thoughts of all of his exciting and terrifying qualities, I drifted off to sleep at my desk. I couldn’t escape him; he was even in my dreams. Subconsciously I knew that I was dreaming, but there he was staring at me, as real as anything else.
He moved closer to me; instantly I felt the electricity coursing through my veins, but because it was a dream, it was even more intense. I turned and ran away, but he chased me. I could hear him only steps behind.
We were running in a forest of thick trees and uneven ground. In my dream, the night stars shone bright enough to light the landscape despite the thick canopy of the trees.  
Although I was running, I wasn’t scared. I knew that I was running because Kiran wanted to ask me a question, and I didn’t want to answer it. But, he was too quick for me.
He grabbed my arm, and the force of the electricity from his touch pulled both of us to the ground. I found that we were now laying on our backs in a meadow, looking up at the million stars lighting up the sky.  
I wanted to get up and run again, but I couldn’t. My limbs felt weak and although the electricity hadn’t left my body yet, a dull humming kept me very conscious of Kiran’s hand intertwined with mine.  
My hair fanned out around me; I noticed that I wore the shorts and tank top I was in while I did my homework. A warm breeze swirled around us, lifting my hair off the ground and then laying it gently to rest again. I could feel Kiran’s eyes on me.  
I looked over at him, unable to speak a word. I was transfixed to the ground, but it was not an unpleasant feeling. Kiran reached over with one hand, still holding my hand with his other to brush the hair away from my face.  
“Eden,” he whispered in a hypnotic voice. “Will you please tell me what you are?” he smiled sweetly. I couldn’t help myself; I wanted to tell him what I was, because I knew that I was something, something different, even though I didn’t know what it was. 
I opened my mouth to speak, but no sound came out. He leaned closer to me and I inhaled his intoxicating aroma, something earthy, something herb-like, but something sweet as well. He placed the palm of his hand against my cheek and electricity surged from his touch. The feeling was heady and overwhelming.
I wanted to struggle, to get away from him, but I couldn’t move. Someone was invading my mind, my soul, or both. The intensity of the pulsing confused me. I trembled under the force of it.
Suddenly a deep and commanding voice spoke, “Eden, wake up.” I lifted my head to see Principal Saint standing at the edge of the meadow, dressed all in black and with a terrible, foreboding expression on his face. 
	And then I awoke, reaching out in the darkness for a hand that remained holding mine only in my dreams.


Chapter Eight

With thoughts of my bizarre dream from the previous night swirling in my head, I stepped out of Aunt Syl’s car unsteadily. Not only was my body psychologically shocked from the sense of realness of my dream, but I was also physically exhausted. My head felt very cloudy from the dull sense of electricity pumping slowly through my veins. Weak and tired, I forced myself forward.  
Slowly, I walked up the hill towards the Administration Building. Students passed me as they hurried to class, but my feet felt clumsy, the electricity made me wobbly. At the top of the hill, I took a left on the brick path towards the English Building, and to my surprise, Principal Saint stood on the path, blocking the way. 
“Eden, may I speak with you for a moment?” His entire presence exuded a dignitary-like respect, and I was sure people did not tell him “no” very often. Despite the request, he stepped in front of me, giving me no other option. At that moment, all I wanted to do was get to class and sit down. I entertained the thought of walking right past him, pretending I didn’t hear. “Please, it will only take a second,” he asked again, noticing my hesitation.  
“Have I done something wrong?” I asked out of habit.
“Not that I am aware…. have you?” he flashed me a smile. He made a joke, but I was too exhausted to respond. He continued, “I am only concerned that Kingsley might be a bit overwhelming for you at first. Are you feeling all right? Has anything strange happened that would give you cause for concern?” His voice was slightly strained, and I saw real apprehension in his eyes. Suddenly he became something to be concerned about. This was getting kind of creepy.
“I’m fine, thank you,” I kept it short and to the point. The last thing I wanted to do was confide in the Principal of the school from hell.
“Of course you are,” he took a quick look around us before finishing with, “If you ever need anything, or if you ever have questions about anything, please feel free to find me immediately.” Before I had a chance to respond, he walked away back toward his office.
That was strange. I wondered for a second if he knew about the weird things going on with me; but then I shook it off. How could he? I never told anyone, not even Aunt Syl. The only thing that could really have alerted him was the mysterious exploding plant, but I was not even sure if he saw what happened, although it was extremely out of the ordinary. I had to admit that.  
I continued toward class, realizing now that I was the only student left standing outside. I tried to pick up my pace, but after my brief encounter with Principal Saint, I was more unstable than ever. The pulsing electricity was steadily growing stronger, and my blood felt like there was a current of energy rushing through it. 
By the time I entered the English and Arts Building I could barely stand up. I needed to empty myself completely before I continued to class. I looked around quickly. Although no students occupied the lobby, I was afraid to cause a scene. My fingers crackled with the sound of electricity and my skin sizzled from the climbing temperature inside.  
As quickly as I could, I ducked into the theater doors, across the hall from the marble staircase. I took a moment to let my eyes adjust to the darkness and started frantically looking around for a place to dispose of my building energy. A sudden burst of electricity surging through my heart made me double over in surprise. I tried to stand up, but only half succeeded. As fast as I could I hurried down the aisle, looking for anything that could be quietly destroyed.
On the stage I recognized the form of an almost hidden tin trash-can. I heard the last bell ring, informing me that I was late for class, so I took the stairs on the side of the stage two at a time and headed straight for the can. Looking around once more to make sure there were no onlookers, I pointed my hands toward the bottom of the can, hoping for a quick second, there was nothing disgusting in it, and released the energy.  
The trashcan exploded. Its contents scattered across the stage, along with shredded pieces of tin. I felt much better and although I was sure the explosion was loud, I was confident it couldn’t have been heard upstairs. I brushed what pieces of debris remained on me and ran for the exit, out the double doors of the theater, and toward the marble staircase.
I didn’t make it far however, before I noticed Kiran and Talbott entering the building. They talked quietly, but heatedly, until they looked up and noticed me leaving the dark theater. They instantly stopped talking and gave each other a quick glance.  
“What were you doing in there?” Kiran asked suspiciously.
“Nothing…. I got lost,” I gave a sheepish grin and slowed down to a fast walk, hoping to make it to the stairs before them. I felt much better after discarding the electricity and felt an entirely new kind of energy, a natural kind.
“I don’t believe you,” Kiran said bluntly, eyes squinting accusatorily.
“Kiran, let’s just get to class,” Talbott interrupted.
“Good idea,” I agreed over my shoulder, passing them while they still stood in the lobby. I made it to the stairs, sprinting the remaining distance to class. By the time I reached the door to English I was completely out of breath.
“Oh, Ms. Matthews, late again, I see,” Mr. Lambert acknowledged my entrance with disdain and irritation. “At Kingsley we try to make promptness part of our daily routine. I hope this will not be a regular occurrence.” He gave me a snide smirk, but allowed me to take my seat in the back without further commentary. Lilly looked back and rolled her eyes.  
A few minutes later, Kiran and Talbott arrived to class. They were both a little red in the face and clearly had continued their argument after I left them. Mr. Lambert offered a genuine smile and said nothing about their tardiness as they took their seats. Now I was the one that was irritated.  
English seemed to drag on under Mr. Lambert's lecture; I struggled to pay attention. He droned on and on about Shakespeare, but my only thoughts lingered on the evidence I left in the theater. At the time I dreaded the consequences of being late for class over the consequences of what would happen to me if the school figured out who trashed the theater…. literally. I groaned inwardly, as I realized I should have cleaned up my mess and destroyed all evidence first and worried about class second.    
“Pssst,” Kiran whispered in my direction. When I refused to look at him, he tried again, “Pssssst.” I pulled my hair over my shoulders and blocked my view of him.
“Eden,” he tried a little louder, causing several students around us to turn and glare. “Eden.”
“What?” I whispered back as sharply as I could, peeking out from behind my wall of hair.
“Why were you late this morning?” he smirked, proud that he was able to get my attention.
“Why were you?” I avoided his question. The theater incident was just one of the many reasons I was running late that morning.
“I’m allowed to be late. Didn’t you sleep well last night?” his grin widened into a proud smile and his perfect, straight and white teeth glistened at me.  
I let my hair fall quickly back in front of my face, and slouched a little lower. My cheeks burned with the memory of my dream from the night before, being near Kiran with my hand in his, his eyes piercing me, as if he was looking into my soul. Thoughts of how inviting and seductive Kiran appeared in my dream conflicted with my fears of him finding out how crazy I was, more specifically about the trashcan. I heard him laugh softly, and a surge of electricity made my blood feel hot beneath my skin. He completely confused my emotions. I didn’t know what I was feeling anymore. 
The bell finally rang and I took my time standing up out of my seat. I gathered my books slowly; all of the time my dark hair masked my face. Eventually, the next class started to file in. I looked up, relieved to be the last junior left. I headed slowly for the stairs, afraid of Drama.
Unfortunately, I didn’t need to wait until class for the drama to begin because Kiran was casually sitting on the black and white marble staircase, blocking my path. He sat in the middle of the fifth step, looking like a model waiting for the photo shoot to begin. His face wore the familiar smirk I had grown accustomed to seeing as he watched me awkwardly approach. I was not totally sure I understood his infatuation with bothering me.
“I was worried you would get lost,” he said smugly as I walked closer.
“Where’s Talbott?” I asked, realizing his absence was strange.  
“He didn’t want to be late for class,” Kiran rose to his feet, waiting for me to ascend the steps.
“Me either,” I breathed, picking up my pace, but brushing shoulders with Kiran as I passed. As soon as our bodies connected, the strong shocking sensation seized my shoulder, forcing me to grab it with my other hand for support. I gasped for air and pulled my body away, but I still felt the impression of his skin hot underneath my shirt.  
“Are you alright?” he asked, his English accent sounding more like mockery than concern.
“I’m fine,” I steadied myself and continued up the stairs as quickly as I could, although I was still out of breath from what felt like tiny lightning bolts in my blood. The shocking sensation encompassed my entire circulatory system and I cursed underneath my breath, determining that I would not faint today.  
“Eden, you are ridiculous!” Kiran sounded exasperated as he caught up with me on the stairs and grabbed my wrist with his hand.  
The force of his touch was too much to handle. The electricity surged through my body at an alarming rate, causing my heart to beat wildly. I forced myself to focus, but my vision blurred and a high-pitched ringing sound pierced my ears. I tried to say something but the world darkened around me. I felt myself falling and wondered for a moment if fainting down a flight of stairs would hurt.

----

“Eden…. Eden…. wake up, Love….” a soft, foreign voice pulled me out of darkness.  
I opened my eyes slowly, but shut them swiftly when blinded from the light of the crystal chandelier hanging from a lofty ceiling. My blood flowed at a rapid pace and burned with a strong current of electricity. My heart, beating quickly, but somewhat controlled, made me realize that I was lying in someone’s arms.  
“Come on…. let me know you are all right,” the voice turned stern. Obeying, I opened my eyes slowly and let them adjust to the light around me.  
I groaned audibly when I looked up to find Kiran looking back at me. His expression read concerned, and when I finally focused on him, I watched his facial muscles relax. His piercing aqua colored eyes gazed into mine; I started to remember what happened and how I ended up in his arms.  
“Did I faint again?” I mumbled as memories slowly started to come back.  
“Mmmm-hmmm…” Kiran smiled and I realized that we were still positioned on the marble staircase. He must have caught me before I fell down the entire flight.
“Thank you,” my voice was a little hoarse. I found that I was very comfortable lying in his arms. Despite the temperature and activity of my blood, I was hesitant to get up. I groaned again, milking it just a little longer.
“How can you really not know what you are?” Kiran’s voice was soft and soothing, and although I didn’t understand his question, he seemed to find it amusing and laughed a little.
“Mr. Kendrick, Ms. Matthews I believe you are supposed to be in class right now,” Principal Saint hollered at us from the middle of the lobby. Unaware that anyone was around, my cheeks blushed with embarrassment.
I tried to sit up quickly as I heard Principal Saint’s footsteps come closer, but Kiran held me down. I looked at him with pleading eyes, mortified by the predicament Principal Saint had found us in. Kiran laughed again, but slowly helped me into a sitting position.  
“I apologize, sir,” Kiran addressed Principal Saint, disdainfully. “You see, we were on our way to class, when Ms. Matthews fainted and nearly took a tumble down the stairs.” I could hear the amusement in his tone and felt like punching him in the shoulder. 
“Is this true, Ms. Matthews?” Principal Saint stopped walking when he reached the bottom of the stairs, and eyed me skeptically.
“Yes, it is true.” I defended, terrified of the consequences I was about to face.  “Luckily, Kiran, um, Mr. Kendrick was here to catch me,” I stood up, shakily and looked as grateful as I thought I felt; although I realized it was all Kiran's fault to begin with.
“Hmmm…. I suppose it was lucky,” Principal Saint did not look completely convinced and eyed Kiran with more suspicion. “Ms. Matthews, are you all right to continue on to class?” I nodded silently. “Fine, then go on. I will inform Ms. Woodsen of the incident. Mr. Kendrick, please come with me, I have an errand for you to run.”  
Principal Saint turned on his heel without waiting for a reply from either of us and headed for the doors that exit the building. Kiran gave me a roguish look and a familiar smirk before following behind Principal Saint. More confused than ever, I stared after them, before turning in the opposite direction to Drama class. Electricity still rushed through my veins, leaving me overwhelmingly weak and shaky.

----

By the time I arrived at lunch, I was exhausted. My nerves were completely fried and my hands could not stop shaking from the violent current in my bloodstream. Every small physical contact with another student sent more electricity running through my body, and my head buzzed from trying to function through it all.  
When I finally took a seat next to Lilly at a table in the corner of the lunchroom, I was physically ill from the trauma that racked the inside of my body. I knew that I looked like a terrible mess. Beads of sweat dripped down my temples and the back of my neck. My hands, shaking so violently, caused me to clasp them together tightly to keep from making a scene. 
“Are you Ok?” Lilly looked at me, concerned.  
“Um, I think I might be coming down with something,” I lied, but knew there was no better explanation. This feeling defied explanation and I preferred not to let Lilly know just how crazy I was. I tried to think of a way to sneak back into the theater after lunch. I needed to blow something up, before I blew up instead.  
“You’re lying,” Kiran’s stern voice accused unexpectedly. I nearly jumped out of my seat. He sat down next to me, so close that our bodies almost touched. Electricity pulsed through me in waves now and I realized I could be sick at any moment. The close proximity to Kiran had sweat pouring down my face and I could feel my blood boiling.
“About what?” I deflected. My shoulders begin to shake more violently.  It was hard to believe; I was still trying to play this off. My hand reached up instinctively to wipe my forehead, but I quickly brought it down again when I saw how badly it was shaking.
“I saw what you did in the theater,” he whispered. He leaned in so that only I could hear him. “And we both know what happened on the stairs. Now look at you; you are clearly about to go into some type of shock.” I should have been grateful for his discretion, but his nearness caused my vision to blur from the intensity of energy. His warm breath tickled my ear, but a cold shiver ran down the back of my neck.
“I don’t know what you mean,” I tried to deflect again, but now I realized Kiran and Talbott weren’t late to English because they had continued their argument; they had gone to investigate the theater after I passed them. It was stupid of me to rush up the stairs so quickly, and it was stupid of me to linger on the stairs with Kiran. Why was he so damn nosey? 
“Yes, you do,” Kiran leaned in closer to my neck, his lips nearly touching my ear. His silky and soft voice lost its edge; his lips brushed my hair. “What’s wrong with you?” He sat back quickly.
I began to convulse, and wondered to myself if this was a seizure. Surely, I was too coherent for a seizure, but my body shook so violently, I could barely stay seated. A small part of me wondered if I should bite down on a spoon, but before I could react, I felt myself falling backwards, slightly aware I was causing a scene.  
I fully expected to hit the floor, but instead, I felt strong arms reach out and catch me. I looked up assuming to see Kiran, but instead I was shocked to see Principal Saint looking down at me. His eyes were full of concern and I could see his mouth was moving, but the ringing in my ears drowned out the sound. That was the last thing I saw before I lost consciousness for the second time that day.


Chapter Nine

I regained consciousness in an unfamiliar place. My head was pounding and my mouth felt like sandpaper. The electricity inside me slowed to a soft hum and my blood temperature cooled down a bit. I must have been in the Nurse’s Office because I was lying on a soft cot and a metal medicine cabinet sat directly to the left of me.  
As I slowly pulled myself into a sitting position, I realized I was not alone. I rubbed my eyes and moved my tongue around in my mouth, but it was no use. I needed a glass of water. 
Arms folded, Principal Saint sat at a desk, staring. A wave of trepidation swept over me.
“Are you feeling alright, Ms. Matthews? You took quite a fall,” his distinct, elegant voice was crisp and serious. He stood up and reached over to hand me a glass of water. I took it, my hands trembling a bit, and drank it quickly.
“I think so,” I still felt weak, and my head was especially fuzzy. “Thank you,” I said hesitantly. He took the cup out of my hand and walked over to fill it again at a sink positioned behind him.
“For what?” he sounded surprised.
“For the water.… and for not letting me fall,” I replied matter-of-factly.
“I did no such thing. You did fall; you fell hard. The student, who brought you here, said you possibly had a seizure. I am here to make sure that you don’t have another,” his voice was full of conviction, but I could have sworn I saw him catch me. 
“A seizure?” I said pretending to be confused. Although confident that I was conscious of what was happening to me, I was not so sure now. I didn’t remember hitting the floor at all. I rubbed the back of my head, but nothing felt sore or tender.
“Yes, Mr. Angelo said you began shaking uncontrollably before passing out; you were fortunate he was near and able to act so quickly. Do you not remember any of this?” he looked at me skeptically.
“No,” I said simply. I leaned my head forward to look at the ground, letting my long hair fall in front of my face. I could not look at this man in the eye when I lied to him; he seemed as if he would be impervious to a dishonest student. Obviously still confused, I didn’t remember Talbott being there at all.
“Hmmm…” he clearly didn’t buy it; but I wasn't sure I bought it either. “Well, the important thing is that you are alright. Do you have any idea of what could have caused this? Has this happened before? What is the last thing you remember?”  
“I don’t know,” I paused, trying to remember what happened. What made me convulse so terribly? “I remember talking with Kiran and then nothing.”  
“Mr. Kendrick?” Principal Saint’s voice raised in alarm, although I had no idea why. “This is worse than I thought,” he mumbled cryptically under his breath. “Eden, I am afraid there is something we need to discuss. This has gotten out of control,” he looked at me gravely, but did not attempt to stand or come closer. A feeling of dread washed over me, but before he could continue, Mrs. Truance stepped through the door.
“Eden’s aunt is here, sir. Would you like me to send her in?” I was amazed at the tone of respect Mrs. Truance used with Principal Saint. Her quiet, subservient demeanor was nothing I had ever seen her exhibit before.  
“Yes, that would be fine. I am sure she is anxious to see her niece,” Mrs. Truance left the room and Principal Saint turned his attention back to me. “Our discussion will have to wait. I am sending you home for the day, and strongly suggest you take the rest of the week off to recuperate. Kingsley does not tolerate sick and fainting students.” He said it with finality and stood to take his leave.  
“Oh, my word, Eden are you all right?” Aunt Syl was through the door and in front of my face before I could react. She was still in her green doctor’s scrubs, and her hair was frazzled. She reached out to put my face in her hands and I inhaled the strong smell of hospital soap.
“I’m fine, really, I’m fine,” I tried to reassure her, but she reached into her pocket and pulled out a small flashlight to begin examining my eyes. I attempted to push her away but she was persistent.  
“They said it was a seizure, I was so worried,” she exclaimed, finally giving up the impromptu checkup and hugging me tightly.
“Aunt Syl, I can’t breathe,” I said, struggling for oxygen. 
“Oh, I’m so sorry dear,” she pulled back, but didn’t take her hands off my shoulders.
“I have excused her for the day, as well as the rest of the week,” Principal Saint interrupted from the doorway. “Please, take this time to recover, and we will see you back here on Monday, healthy. I will have Ms. Mason bring over your homework and make sure you are caught up on classes.” With his final instructions, he left us alone, closing the door behind him.
“What happened?” Aunt Syl asked exasperatedly. “The school called me at the hospital and I rushed over here right away.”
“I guess I had some sort of seizure or something…. I don’t really remember to be honest. But I feel much better now; I think I’m fine. Let’s just go home,” I looked up at her with pleading eyes, giving her my most charming smile, hoping to convince her.  
“Nice try, but seizures are serious Eden. I am going to take you to the hospital for a full checkup, and then we will go home…. Ok? Who is Ms. Mason?” Aunt Syl was serious. I knew there was no getting out of all of the tests I was about to have run on me. I inwardly groaned, not sure if I was up to being poked and prodded. Still, I wondered if there was a diagnosis for blood made out of lightning.  
“Lilly, the girl I was telling you about yesterday,” I hopped off the cot and adjusted my uniform. Aunt Syl checked out with Mrs. Truance before we left; but we eventually made our way down to her car, parked slightly askew in front of the school.
Before we could begin our escape and to my utter despair and frustration, I noticed Kiran jogging down to us from the Administration Building. I cringed, unsure why he just couldn’t leave me alone. Since I was still not feeling like myself, I was in no mood to deal with him. 
“Eden,” he called from a few feet away as I tried to slide into the passenger’s seat as quickly as my trembling appendages would let me. “Eden!”
“Who is that?” Aunt Syl was both impressed and confused by the unbelievably good-looking boy jogging in our direction.
“What?” I shouted exasperatedly, stepping back out of the car and closing the door, hoping to shield, whatever this was about, from my aunt.
“Are you Ok?” he came to a stop too close for comfort, but thankfully I only felt the soft hum of electricity that had come to be normal. 
“I’m fine,” I said quickly, hoping he would just get to the point.  
“Are you sure?” he reached out to hold my hand, reminding me of the dream I had about him last night. I let him hold it for a moment, feeling butterflies instead of overwhelming energy, before taking it back. He smiled slightly.
“Yes, I’m sure, but my aunt is taking me to get a checkup anyway,” I said with slight irritation. “What do you want?” I hoped he was not here to ask me about the trashcan in the theater again.
“I just wanted to make sure you were Ok,” he smiled wider and I found myself smiling back. I couldn’t help it. He was just beautiful with his perfect white teeth, surrounded by perfect lips and perfect dimples. Even his eyes smiled at me.  
“Thank you,” I said softening a little. “But really, I’m fine.  Like I said, I’m going to the hospital, and I am sure they will tell me that there is nothing wrong with me. So.... I’ll see you later,” I tried to turn away from him and get in the car, but he was not finished.  
“I brought you your backpack,” he blurted, never taking his eyes off mine. I reached out to take it from him, willing myself to look away from his shining turquoise eyes. I felt the heat rush to my cheeks, and let my hair fall in front of my face to hide the embarrassing blush.  
“Thank you,” I mumbled again. I took the backpack and our fingertips brushed softly together. Butterflies and electricity surged through my body this time, and I realized it was time to get out of there before Aunt Syl would witness one of my “episodes.”   
“Can I bring you your homework tonight?” his eyes wavered for a second and I realized that he was nervous.  
“Um, actually I think Lilly is going to bring it,” I replied in a rush.  
“Mr. Kendrick, get back to class,” Principal Saint’s voice called from the top of the hill. Clearly annoyed, Kiran looked up, and then looked back at me. His entire body tensed; I could see that he was torn. Surprised by his reaction, I could still relate to it. Every time that Kiran tried to talk to me, Principal Saint showed up out of nowhere to keep us apart. Maybe it was just a coincidence, maybe not.
“We’ll see about that,” he whispered before turning around and jogging back up the hill. I stood staring after him for a moment, wondering if he was talking about class or my homework tonight.  
Kiran left me once again confused, but excited at the same time. With so many mixed emotions, no wonder I couldn’t keep control of myself. Thankful I would have something to distract me the rest of the afternoon; I climbed back in the car. I was almost looking forward to the promised MRI and CT scan; maybe Aunt Syl would even throw in a PET scan just for good measure…. one could only hope.


Chapter Ten

I never thought I would miss school, especially Kingsley, but sitting in front of my window Sunday night, I could not wait to get back there. Or rather, I could not wait to get out from under Aunt Syl’s watchful eye.
The tests at the hospital all came back normal. I knew they would, I knew that whatever was wrong with me was not going to show up on a hospital chart or graph, unless maybe it was a mental hospital.  
Aunt Syl was less than convinced when they told me everything was fine and I could go home. Since she decided to use some of her accumulated vacation days just to be sure I didn’t die, I was under constant supervision.
My week was full of manicures, pedicures, hair appointments and hours and hours of yoga. I had done enough up-dog, down-dog, Warrior-two for a lifetime. I enjoyed spending so much time with Aunt Syl, but so much relaxing proved hard for both of us to accomplish.   
My aunt, an important ER doctor, was most comfortable with constant movement and nights of sleeplessness. I was accustomed to her absence for days at a time, and taking care of myself. I wasn't sure if we had ever spent that much quality time together. It was nice at first, but we were both in the habit of being alone.  
Finally, that afternoon, she could stay home no longer and found an excuse to go to the hospital. Since I had never experienced an episode at home, I was sure she believed I’d be Ok by now.
The only other person I had seen was Lilly. She faithfully brought me my homework every night and stayed for supper. She also sat with me for hours explaining it, especially French. She was just as fluent as everyone else; having already finished her required French classes and moved onto Latin. Why I didn't think to ask her for help to begin with was beyond me.
Lilly was what Kingsley called a “boardy”; which meant that her parents lived elsewhere and rented her an apartment during the school year. Apparently, most of the students at Kingsley lived like that. Their parents, all super important and super rich, sent their children far away and provided them with all of the teenage necessities: food, lodging, chauffeurs, cooks, maids, tutors and no-limit, black, American Express cards.  
I had heard of that sort of thing before, but my idea of a prep school, worth all that trouble, was located usually near an ocean, not in the middle of nowhere. When I asked Lilly why these students didn’t go somewhere like New York, or North Carolina, she informed me that Kingsley was the trifecta for people of our stature. Since that only confused me more, she explained that Kingsley was not only the best of the best in the world of academia, but it was located where students couldn’t find too much trouble and most of the parents were either close friends with the school board or Principal Saint.
I doubted that I fit in to any of those categories for attending, but remembered Aunt Syl’s sizable donation to the science department before my admission forms were accepted. Despite all of her freedom, however, I could tell that Lilly was lonely. Thankfully, Aunt Syl loved her just as much as I did, so she spent most of her time at our house, refusing only to spend the night. Eventually I figured I would just convince her to move in with us.  
   The flash of headlights in my driveway pulled me out of my musing. Aunt Syl must be home from the hospital. I threw an oversized navy-blue Kingsley sweatshirt on over my tank top; it hung down over my shorts, making me look like it was the only thing I had on. I gave up on my Calculus homework and headed down to the kitchen, hoping she brought home something to eat with her. 
The cooler weather brought a nice breeze through the windows, giving the house a freshly mowed grass smell. I inhaled the pleasing aroma, thankful the humidity was finally letting up a bit. Soon the leaves would be turning colors and the rain would come; fall was my favorite time of year.
Just as I entered the kitchen, the doorbell rang. I turned around and walked back through the living room to the front door. Wondering why she chose the front door instead of the garage, I flung the door open, expecting to see my aunt. To my utter shock, Kiran was standing in the doorway looking like a page out of magazine. What was he doing here?
“What are you doing here?” I blurted out, completely aware of what I was wearing and the mess of hair piled on top of my head.
“Don’t you look cute?” he said mischievously, in his crisp English accent. He gave me his signature smirk and let his eyes drift over my legs. His wavy blonde hair, slicked back away from his face and wearing a black motorcycle jacket, he could have been cast in a scene from “Rebel without a Cause.”  
“What are you doing here?” I repeated, stunned and practically drooling.
“I came to see if you were Ok. You haven’t been at school all week; I thought maybe something terrible happened to you,” he stepped past me into my house and I inhaled his scent, feeling suddenly dizzy.
“Um, come in then,” I still managed some sarcasm though my mind was swirling and I could feel the pin pricks of electricity start to return.
“So are you… Ok?” he turned back around to face me, his smirk still playing at the corners of his lips. His voice relayed no real emotion of concern and I could tell that he knew I would be fine before he came.  
“I’m fine,” I answered, or, at least, I was fine until he showed up.
“Good,” he took a step closer. I pushed the door closed and leaned back against it, not really sure what to do now. I glanced around the room, debating if I should ask him if he wanted something to eat, or if I should just kick him out.
“Yep,” I replied shortly, filling the awkward silence. I looked around the room again; hoping some piece of interesting information would come to me, and noticed he was still looking at me. “What?” I said half-laughing, half-humiliated.
“What are you wearing?” he took another step closer and lifted the hem of my sweatshirt with one finger, letting his other fingers brush lightly against my thigh. 
I couldn’t move. I couldn’t think. I couldn’t do anything with him that close. Although his fingers were barely touching me, they were completely weighing me down. The excitement his touch brought, scared me and I found myself trying to remember how to breathe.
“Eden,” he breathed softly, almost whispering. I willed myself to look up into his eyes. His gaze was so intense I couldn’t look away; he smiled softly. “Why haven’t you called to let me know you are all right? After saving your life on numerous occasions, I think I deserve at least a phone call.... A friend would have called,” he pouted sarcastically but leaned his face in closer. It was too bad for him that I saw through him.
“I apparently need to remind you that we are not friends,” I retorted quickly, snapping out of my daze. “Plus, I don’t your phone number….” I mumbled hastily. His eyes flashed with something that looked like frustration, but instead of offering his number, he softened his gaze and refused to look away. A wave of embarrassment washed over me; he shouldn’t be able to manipulate me so easily just because he was the most gorgeous thing I had ever seen. 
I tore my eyes away from his and walked across the room, leaving him to face the door alone. Maybe he would take the hint. I definitely did not need to be reminded of how often I fainted in the last few days.  
I didn’t care if I had to stand ten feet away from him at all times, I was not going to let him get to me so easily. His face flashed with frustration, before he put his seductive mask back on. Apparently, he thought I would be easy.
“Oh come on,” he crooned, “We’re friends. I thought we were going to try to get along.”  
“You thought wrong,” I said flatly. Now that my emotions had calmed down, I could feel the slow tingling of electricity making its way through my veins. It was days since I had to deal with the energy, I almost forgot how uncomfortable it was.
“Eden, what do you have against me? Why all the hostility?” he gave me a playful smile and walked over to one of Syl’s oversized, leather couches and plopped down. Great…. How did you get rid of somebody who refused to be gotten rid of?
“What hostility?” I questioned, feigning innocence.
“I just don’t understand why you won’t confide in me,” although his posture was relaxed, his gaze remained intense and I watched his jaw flex and un-flex. I wondered at his use of the word “confide.” Weren’t we just talking about my gratitude?  
“Kiran, there is nothing to confide. I have no idea what you are talking about. If you want a thank you, well then, thank you. I appreciate all of the concussions you saved me from,” I laughed a little, trying to pretend he was as ridiculous as he sounded.  
“You’re lying. You are more than what you seem,” he sat up straight and folded his arms across his chest. He looked like a little kid pouting. “I could help you, you know.”  
“Oh, you want to help me?” I mocked, mimicking his accent, although it came out very badly. I wasn’t sure exactly what ethnicity I just impersonated… Indian, perhaps?  “Now, I’ll tell you. Oh wait, there’s nothing to tell.” I finished sarcastically.
“Are you expecting someone?” he stood up abruptly and glanced around the room.      
“My aunt,” I said, looking around as well. We were standing at opposite sides of the room, but the electricity coursing through my blood grew steadily stronger.
“No, someone else,” he squinted his eyes and walked around the room. “I’m getting tired of this, old man,” he mumbled it so quietly, and his accent was so thick that I was not sure what or who he was talking to.  
He turned away from the window and walked straight over to me, dropping all pretenses. His eyes were hungry and his face said something I didn’t recognize…. maybe desire? I backed slowly away from him, not sure what he was about to do. My foot bumped into the fireplace and I knew that I was pinned. Electricity and anxiety washed over me.
Kiran let me struggle; I saw the familiar smirk returning to his lips. He looked over me until his eyes finally settled on mine. I lost myself in the depth of his ocean-blue eyes and worried that I would say or do anything he wanted now.  
“You’re not crazy, you know,” he placed his hands on my arms and pulled me slightly closer. My stomach erupted with butterflies, making me forget about the energy that nearly knocked me off my feet.
“I wish I knew what you were talking about,” I lied, but I knew the conviction didn’t reach my voice.
“Sure,” he leaned in closer, hesitating for a moment, our lips just barely apart. Kiran looked at me for a second longer before changing his mind and kissing me tenderly on the cheek. He let his lips linger on my face, while the warmth of his body heat warmed me all over. I felt my body tremble as his sweet breath tickled my face.  
I was not sure how to react, or even if I could react. Since this was the first kiss I had ever received from a boy, ever…. I was completely frozen. His lips left my cheek burning, and my body began to overheat. I couldn’t tell if it was from his kiss or the electricity surging through me at an alarming rate.  
He looked into my eyes again, watching my reaction. Unfortunately, for him, all I could do was stand perfectly still while willing my body under control. He laughed gently, then turned around, and walked out the front door.
I placed my hands behind my back and pointed them towards the fireplace. Not entirely sure why I felt the need to be discreet in my own home, especially now that I was alone, I let the energy escape through my palms and into the open hearth. Thankfully the only damage was to my ears, from the loud popping noise of the small explosion that I created; otherwise, a large fire was the only evidence of the electricity I let escape.
I heard the garage door open and knew that it was my aunt coming home for sure this time. I was too shell-shocked from Kiran's surprise visit to want to see or talk to her, so I headed for the stairs. My weak body and a stomach still full of butterflies, affirmed that I didn't understand my feelings for Kiran. It was no wonder that I could barely control my actions either. A shiver ran over me, and I couldn't decide if it was from excitement or fear.  
Just as I passed by the living room window, however, I saw somebody or something move from behind a tree in the front yard. I stood there staring for a few seconds, one foot on the staircase, one on the wood floor, expecting Kiran to jump out from behind the large oak or something. But instead of Kiran, a tall, masculine figure walked out from behind the tree, clearly not Kiran.  
In a long trench coat and bowler hat, he walked slowly and purposefully across my yard and down the street. A shiver once again traveled up my back, but this time I clearly recognized it as fear. Somebody was watching me.


Chapter Eleven

I parked my car in the long line of black something or others, taking up two parking spaces. My sunflower yellow Land Rover stuck out terribly, but I could have cared less. I took a big breath, thankful that I didn’t fit in there. But even more thankful that I was allowed to drive myself that morning.  
Of course, that was only due to the fact that Aunt Syl was called into the ER in the middle of the night. Feeling slightly sorry for her, but still happy to have my independence back, I grabbed my backpack and stepped out of the car.
Although I was running significantly late, I stopped to take another deep breath and mentally prepared myself. I had no idea how my body would handle returning to school after my short hiatus. I was definitely concerned about the whole fainting thing, and would have rather avoided it for the rest of my life.
I was pleased that my close encounter with Kiran brought no immediate spells of unconsciousness, and hoped that my previous behavior was all just a phase I was now, hopefully, over. I still could not mentally wrap my head around Kiran’s unexpected visit or his even more unexpected exit. I unconsciously brought my hand to my cheek and smiled. I felt the heat rise beneath my fingers and quickly shook my head, physically trying to forget last night’s intimate moment.    
The student parking lot sat on the back of campus, near the football and soccer fields, so I bypassed the Administration Building and headed straight for English. A nice change from being dropped off at the front of campus like all of the other students who were too young or too rich to drive themselves.  
A handful of students were in front of me, scrambling to get to class on time. All of them dressed in their navy blue and white uniforms; the only change today was the addition of navy blue or cardinal red cardigans, signaling the change in temperature. I was always amazed at the ability some girls had of changing a dowdy school uniform into a stripper piece from some teenage boy’s wildest fantasy; I was not one of those girls.
 I clearly picked out Kiran and Talbott in the throng of students ahead of me since they were walking much slower than everybody else. I slowed my pace slightly, not sure if I wanted to pass them, or be brave enough to join them. I mean Kiran and I were friends right? Or something more? Or something entirely different all together? I actually had no idea what we were.
I noticed how much taller Talbott was than Kiran, how much taller than everybody he was, and how strong he was built. I had a hard time picturing him in a bowler hat, but realized it must have been him behind the tree last night. An instant wave of relief washed over me. I had no idea why he would wear a disguise to accompany Kiran to my house, but it was the only thing that made any sense.
I was still pondering whether to pass or wait them out when they simultaneously turned around to look at me. Kiran gave me a small wave and an almost sheepish grin. I noticed near embarrassment in his eyes; it was the most endearing he had ever looked. I gave a small wave back and felt my cheeks burning from the memory of last night.
Talbott noticed our exchange and slapped the back of Kiran’s head. My mouth dropped open from shock and amusement. Kiran stopped dead in his tracks and Talbott followed suit. They stood there staring at each other, both refusing to say or do anything more. For a second I thought they were going to fight.  
“Enough of this Kiran, go to class,” Talbott demanded.  
“Who do you think you are?” Kiran shouted hostilely. They were both angry enough that their accents were making it difficult to understand them. The remainder of students, running as late as we were, turned to watch the exchange. I wiped the smile off of my face and realized this could get serious.
“Go to class,” instead of shouting, Talbott’s voice was a low growl.
“You cannot talk to me like that. I won’t forget this,” Kiran snarled back, but obediently and without looking at me again, walked on. Talbott did not continue walking however, but stayed where he was. His demeanor remained calm, and he turned his body to face me. After I refused to walk any closer to him, he signaled me with his hand.
“You can’t keep playing this game with him,” he started speaking to me as soon as I was close; a look of sincere determination on his face.  
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” I replied, slightly offended, and feeling like I used that phrase an awful lot lately. If there really was anything between Kiran and me, who was Talbott to get in the way? More importantly, why was Talbott getting in the way? And even more importantly, was there anything between Kiran and me?
“I’m afraid you do,” he alleged softer, making his accent thick. I continued walking and he matched his strides with mine. “Listen, we are all curious about you, I’m sure you understand, but Kiran is taking this too far. It’s not fair to him and it’s definitely not fair to you. You are only going to get hurt.”
“Thank you for your concern, but really there is nothing for you to worry about,” I tried to stay polite, but get the message across at the same time. The soft undulating energy that was only a hum a moment ago was steadily growing stronger the longer I talked with Talbott, making my temper even harder to control.
“I am warning you for your own good,” he persisted. “Stay away from him.”  
“I am trying to stay away from him. Maybe it’s him you should be having this conversation with.”  
“I’ve tried to talk to him….. He is focused. When he finds something to…. entertain him, it is hard to refocus him; and you Eden, are turning out to be much more than mere entertainment. I am afraid the game is getting dangerous,” When I opened my mouth to say something he continued quickly, “You should know that he has a girlfriend,” he looked at me out of the corner of his eye and I knew that he was waiting for me to react. So I played it as cool as I could, continuing en route to English class.
“Really. Who?” I tried to ask coyly, but I could feel my blood temperature rise and not from the electricity this time, for whomever the girl was. The energy rushing through my veins centered unexpectedly and surged out through my fingertips into the grass, creating a small fire. I stopped suddenly to stomp it out, hoping Talbott didn’t notice. And he didn’t, or at least he pretended he didn’t.  
“Seraphina. That is why we are at Kingsley. He moved here to be closer to her,” he reached out to open the door for me and the gesture gave me a second to recover.  
“Figures,” I sighed under my breath. “Listen, I’m really not into him. As far as I’m concerned, there is nothing for you to worry about. Seraphina and Kiran make a nice couple, really, they deserve each other,” I finished through gritted teeth. All anger had vanished; instead I could only feel disgust for myself. Clearly, I was making something out of nothing.
“So I have your word, you will not distract him anymore?” his language was confusing to me, I was not going to give “my word” about anything; the promise seemed too binding. Besides that wasn’t really up to me, right?
“Whatever Talbott, I won’t bother him anymore,” we were almost to class and I could not wait to be finished with the conversation; for some unexplainable reason I was suddenly depressed. I hoped I wasn’t jealous of Seraphina. I found that especially degrading.
Before I could get through the classroom door however, Talbott put a soft hand on my shoulder, stopping me. “Eden, he can be quite persistent. He is very intrigued by you. He has never met anyone quite like you, so you will have to give him a clear message,” I turned to look at him in the face, hoping that he was joking, but I was met with frighteningly serious eyes. “Even if you are human, Seraphina will not be very forgiving if she senses any competition,” he tightened his grip on my shoulder, sending lightning bolts running down my arm. I was officially irritated.
“Listen, this doesn’t sound like my problem. If Kiran is unhappy with his relationship then let them work it out. As far as I’m concerned, none of this has anything to do with me,” I was finished with this, so I pushed passed Talbott into the classroom. I was late again and I could hear Mr. Lambert lecturing me as I headed straight for my seat. Wasn’t it just last night that I was looking forward to coming to school? 

----

The rest of the day went surprisingly quick. I was very prepared to ignore Kiran completely, but as it turned out, he was the one to give me the cold shoulder. This irritated me more than anything.
All day I began plotting what I would say to him if we happened to bump into each other. But I soon realized all of our previous run-ins must have actually been on purpose, because suddenly he was nowhere to be seen. By the time I was sitting in eighth hour Chemistry, I felt terribly mopey.    
The most irritating thing of all was that I had never noticed Kiran and Seraphina were a couple. Seraphina was loud and obnoxious, always drawing attention to herself; never once had I looked up to see Kiran at her side, worshiping her like the rest of the sheep.  
Occasionally they would sit next to each other in class, and always at lunch, but I just thought those were their social obligations, since they were the cool kids and all. Now, every time I looked up they seemed to be side by side…. Laughing…. Touching…. Was I so consumed with myself I couldn’t see what was going on around me?
On top of everything I could not figure out why this bothered me so much. Or why I felt like Kiran lied to me. It’s not like I had asked him if he had a girlfriend and he said no. And he never really pursued me, or said that he liked me. Most of the time, he made me angry.
I doodled on my paper, resting my head on my arm. The electricity was at a medium hum, but my energy level was much lower. I recognized my depression and it depressed me even more. I shouldn’t let this get to me as much as it was.
Suddenly, I snapped out of my funk and saw everything clearly. I was a game to him, just a game. Nothing was real, not even last night. It was just like Talbott said, I was only entertainment.  
I bought into the whole good-looking, charming accent, playfully-mischievous persona and allowed myself to get emotionally involved. I was sure that if he didn’t have that damn accent I would have seen through him immediately. Oh, those Brits could be so charming and manipulative with their proper way of talking.
I tried to sort through my feelings further. I never really felt anything more than physical attraction…. did I? I mean sure, the whole kiss thing last night left an impression, but I was sure any girl would have had the same reaction. He was the one who was practically stalking me; he showed up at my house uninvited. I never wanted anything to do with him; he forced himself on me.  
What may have been construed as jealousy or resentment for Seraphina was really just pity. I felt bad for her; she had no idea what kind of person she was dating. He was probably just using her too. He seemed like that type of guy.… 
I was no longer depressed; there was no more reason to feel sorry for myself; because I was livid, absolutely livid. I saw Kiran for who he was now, a disgusting, narcissistic pig. Albeit a completely gorgeous, perfect pig; but definitely a pig. And I certainly didn’t want anything more to do with him.  
I was interrupted from my epiphany by someone knocking on the classroom door. Mr. Hayman looked up from the chalk board at the front of the class and walked across the room to open it. A tall, athletic man in a black track suit entered, carrying a clip board and wearing a whistle.  
“This couldn’t have waited until the end of class?” Mr. Hayman asked the man.
“Who is that?” I whispered to Lilly.
“That’s Mr. Lawly, our P.E. teacher,” she whispered back.
“We have P.E.?” I said shocked. I didn’t realize I had signed up for P.E., and I was sure I would have found a different elective if given the choice.
“Upper classman have a special kind of P.E.,” she replied, but didn’t get a chance to explain. The two men had stopped talking to each other and Mr. Lawly called for the attention of the class.
“As you know our camping trip was scheduled for later in the quarter. But due to unforeseen problems in scheduling and the fact that I am worried about weather if we wait any longer, we are going to take it this weekend. The arrangements have been made and your parents notified. I am happy to say I spoke to all of them personally and not one of you has a legitimate excuse to miss,” audible groans were heard throughout the classroom. “You can pick up permission slips and a list of what to bring on your way out of class. And may I remind you, all of you are required to attend,” when he said this last bit, he looked directly at Kiran. I found that amusing.
“What camping trip? I don’t remember signing up for a camping trip,” I looked, panicked and wild eyed to Lilly, hoping she would have some answers.
“It’s on your class schedule as Special Elective,” she rolled her eyes. “The camping trip is our P.E. class. The school board wants us to get ‘real life’ experience.”
“So the whole class is over in one weekend?” I asked hopefully.
“Hardly…. Kingsley believes itself too important to fill our day with a menial class like P.E. So to fulfill the requirement they send us on one of these god-awful trips every quarter. I think next time we go rock climbing or something as equally terrible as camping. Everybody hates them, but there is seriously no way to get out of it. They think of everything, trust me.”
“I have never been camping in my life,” I was terrified. The only thing I knew about camping, was that every camper in any scary movie I had ever seen was always hacked to pieces.  
“That’s the idea,” she rolled her eyes again. “The trips are meant to get us out of our comfort zone, make us do something we would never choose to do.”  
“Oh. Fantastic,” It was my turn to roll my eyes.  
A weekend trapped in the woods with this group of people sounded exactly like a horror movie to me. Could I request specifically that they check everyone’s bags for chainsaws and hockey masks? Because surely, I would be the first one to die.


Chapter Twelve


“We’re here,” Lilly sighed despondently and I opened my eyes. I hadn’t really been asleep, but there was nothing else to do on the four hour journey to the middle of nowhere.
“This is it? Please tell me we don’t have to hike for hours into that jungle,” I whined. Our bus was parked in the middle of a gravel parking lot surrounded completely by trees. There was literally nothing else but trees. I searched frantically for a gas station, or convenience store nearby, but all I could see were trees. I was not even sure if this was a legal camping area.  
I yawned widely and had a feeling that my breath smelled awful. I glanced down at my wrinkled sweats and t-shirt and realized I looked as bad as I felt. I was pretty sure this was what the rest of the weekend was going to be like: sloppy clothes and bad breath.  Our 4:00 AM departure time didn’t help the fact that I had been perpetually grumpy since I set foot on the bus. Mr. Lawly seemed like such a nice man at first until I realized he was a drill sergeant with the intention of fully entrenching us in the wilderness. My idea of camping entailed an RV and heated swimming pool; it was obvious I was about to be sorely disappointed.
“I think it’s a forest, and yes, there will be some hiking involved,” Lilly gave me a dejected look. “Your shoes are cute though,” she offered me a bleak smile.
“Not for long….. Is it too late to go home?” I rubbed my bleary eyes, trying to focus on my brand new hiking boots.
“Afraid so. Come on,” we grabbed our things and followed the rest of the students out of the bus. 
Someone started pulling backpacks from the luggage compartment and Lilly and I found ours and strapped them on. Aunt Syl and I had to go on an emergency shopping trip since I owned none of the essentials. Normal people don’t keep things like sleeping bags, hiking backpacks, portable stoves, canteens and two-person tents lying around. Ok, well some normal people did, but not me.  
I looked around at the other thirty students and doubted any of them did either. Everything looked brand new and high tech; I even saw a random price tag still attached. We might as well have been a commercial for Coleman.  
Lilly looked so tiny underneath her gigantic backpack I was convinced she was going to tip over. Her bright red hair covered by an army green hat, she peered out from underneath it barely able to see. But she bore the burden surprisingly well as we made our trek into the wild unknown.  
Mr. Lawly appeared to know where he was going, and he was constantly consulting a compass, but after an hour of ruining my brand new hiking boots, I was skeptical. That a group of thirty or so students were following this man blindly into the wilderness did not seem like the brightest idea to me, but I guessed he was trustworthy. And if something were to happen to our only chaperone, I was sure the thirty of us would know exactly how to rough it in the wild until someone came to find us….. yeah, right.    
“You’re not afraid are you?” a familiar English accent had come to walk beside me, creating an equally familiar electrical buzzing throughout my veins. And so the shock therapy began.  
“Of what?” I asked dryly, not sure what to expect and completely positive I didn’t want to be bothered.
“Of bears and mountain lions and such,” Kiran said seriously.
“There aren’t any bears in the middle of Nebraska,” I laughed incredulously, although inwardly I was cringing.
“Are you sure? We’re close the Niobrara River. I’m pretty sure there are bears, mountain lions and wolves. I hear they like to prey on unsuspecting girls who have clearly never been camping before. This is their home you know, you are the intruder,” he grew more dramatic with every syllable and although I knew he was just trying to scare me, I hated to admit that it was working.
“Oh, and you have been camping?” I glanced at him skeptically, but noticed that his hiking boots looked well worn. “But yes, I am sure, now go away,” I didn’t have the patience for him and I couldn’t afford to faint if we had much longer to go. My pack was getting heavy and my sweat pants were starting to get too hot.
“But who’s going to protect you from the big bad wolf?” I could hear the smile in his voice but I refused to look his direction as I trudged on past him.  
“I can take care of myself,” I called over my shoulder and caught back up with Lilly.
“What was that about?” she asked softly, always the discreet one.
“Ugh. Kiran, playing his games again,” I knew that Lilly wouldn’t understand what I was talking about, but she was polite enough not to ask. Although I considered her a close friend now, I had never been one to open up much to others. I expected she was the same way, since she had never said a word about Talbott, but I saw the way they looked at each other.
I scanned the wilderness in every direction, telling myself over and over that Kiran was just joking, but a small amount of fear crept its way through my body. And then the worst thing possible happened; Kiran snuck up behind me grabbing both of my shoulders and shouting “boo” loudly in my ears. I screamed bloody murder and jumped at least five feet. The entire class turned around to see what the commotion was and all I could do was hang my head in embarrassment. I could hear Kiran’s snickers behind me and I had half a mind to turn around and punch him.
“Alright kids, we’re here,” Mr. Lawly called out from the head of the group. We walked into a clearing in the middle of a dense forest. I could hear running water not far away and assumed it was a creek or a river or something. The space was wide enough to accommodate all of us although I saw no outlet for electricity. The realization that this far out there was no possibility of real plumbing also occurred to me. Welcome to hell.
Although all of the upcoming “P.E. classes” were a bit more involved, this particular one was basically just about surviving. I would have been terrified of what the other ones entailed if I could have been sure I was going to make it through this one. However, the outcome of this weekend was looking more and more pessimistic.
The rest of the morning was spent setting up the campsite and going over the rules. Mr. Lawly talked on and on about what to do with food, and trash and how to go to the bathroom. Yuck. He also gave a long lecture about not wondering off, not pulling pranks and not swimming in the river alone…. or naked. Blah, blah, blah.
After Lilly and I had successfully set up our tent, and gotten sufficiently dirty we headed over to the river with our fishing poles. Mr. Lawly’s idea of camping included “catching” our lunch. This was going to be interesting.  
The entire class was set up along the bank, every student holding some type of fancy fishing rod. We found a quiet space at the nearby stream and set up our own respective poles.  
Well, we tried to set up our fishing poles. Eventually Mr. Lawly made his way over and explained what we needed to do, and then eventually he just ended up doing it for us. If I wasn’t so frustrated with my freaking fishing pole, I would have found the image of thirty very privileged, very snobby prep school kids trying to catch their own food hilarious. I had just learned why fishing was considered a sport.
I stared into the stream for what seemed like hours, but in actuality was probably more like thirty minutes. I was starving, I was dirty and I was never going to catch a fish, and even if I did the chances of me actually eating it were very slim. Well, at least I wouldn’t have caught a fish if I had the chance.  
As I watched the water, hoping for a glimpse of anything fish-like, and tried to ignore the humming of electricity running through my veins at a steady rate I noticed Seraphina approaching out of the corner of my eye. Her habit was to usually ignore Lilly and me, so I didn’t think anything of it, until she stopped directly behind me.
“Stay away from Kiran,” she growled threateningly.  
I half turned my head to say something snotty, but she didn’t give me the chance. I felt her palm on my back and with surprising force she shoved me straight into the stream of ice cold water. My head just barely missed a rock in the shallow end of the riverbank, as I went face first beneath the surface, drenching myself completely.    
I rolled over quickly into a sitting position with my knees sticking out of the water, not entirely sure what to do. I was horrified and humiliated. I looked around to see everyone laughing at me and somewhere I could hear Mr. Lawly yelling “What did I say about swimming!” 
“You’re right Mr. Lawly, I felt like a swim and therefore dove into the freezing cold, three foot stream, with all of my clothes on, on purpose,” I thought to myself. 
From where I sat, water flowing over me; I could see Seraphina and her groupies all laughing and pointing. I couldn’t say that Talbott didn’t warn me, but really was any of this my fault? I thought I had left Kiran alone, though clearly not soon enough.  
My eyes continued to roam until I found the boy in question, standing away from the crowd staring at me without any smile on his face. I couldn’t make out his expression, but I knew mine was one of pure disgust.
The electricity already shaking my body began to rise with my temper. The angrier I got, the stronger the energy pulsed through me. I had never felt it that strong before. Anger turned to fear when I realized I didn’t know what I was going to do with it. I was so unsure of how my body was going to react to that much force that I was terrified to even stand up. My hands began to shake and I was fully aware I was about to look more like a freak than ever, if that was even possible at this point.
I had to get out of there, I had no other choice. Even if I fainted, at least maybe I could get to shore first. It would have been better than drowning in the middle of the cold shallow stream with an audience whom I doubted would even come to my rescue.
  I slammed my hands in the water, to push myself out of the slow current, but that, unfortunately, turned out to be a big mistake. As soon as my palms touched the cool water, energy erupted out of them and what I created was beyond bad.  
A giant tidal wave, of what seemed to be the entire river engulfed the shore. I watched in terror as all of my classmates and Mr. Lawly were suddenly and unexplainably covered head to toe in a torrential downpour.  Well, at least no one was laughing anymore.
In fact, no one said anything, they all just stared at me….dripping wet. Fish lined the shore, but most of the students continued to hold onto their poles, completely shocked. Seraphina gave me a death stare, even Lilly looked less than happy.
I stood up as the riverbed began to fill again and walked straight through the crowd of people. No one said anything or even attempted to stop me. I didn’t know what I would have done if they did. There was no explanation I could think of that would make sense; there was no explanation I could even give them period. I couldn’t explain what just happened myself. 
And so with head down, I marched straight back through the woods and into my tent. I realized it was just a tent, that the only thing separating me from the outside world was a thin layer of canvas, but it would have to do for now.  
I ripped off my wet clothes and flung them outside the tent opening. I grabbed my sleeping bag and used it for a towel, regretting the action as soon as I realized it now smelled like river water. I finally found some new clothes and threw myself down on my air-mattress.
Eventually I would have to face them again, but now was not the right time, I was positive of that. My hair was drenched, still dripping and smelled like fish. I closed my eyes and breathed in the solitude, even if it only lasted a minute. I might have destroyed what little illusion of sanity I had left, but at least I had expelled the electricity for now and maybe, just maybe could get a few minutes of rest.


Chapter Thirteen


Eventually everyone dried off. Mr. Lawly made several small fires for all of the students to sit around. He also gave everyone a dried food packet he had brought along for emergencies. I doubted he expected he would need them so soon.
Thankfully Mr. Lawly didn’t banish me. He was actually surprisingly nice; he even built Lilly and me our own fire so I wouldn’t have to face the other students yet. I supposed dealing with thirty vengeful high-schoolers was enough punishment for one girl to endure.  
Our activity for the afternoon was supposed to be a long hike through the wilderness. Thanks to me, and the fact that everyone’s shoes needed to dry out, it would only be a short hike through the wilderness. Just in time to get back and try to catch our dinner, hopefully tsunami free.
Mr. Lawly called us to our feet and we formed a wide line. Lilly and I hung back slightly, so we could take our places in the far back. I was not ready to look anyone in the eye yet; I couldn’t even look Lilly in the eye. She hadn’t asked me any questions about my accidental tidal wave, and I appreciated her more than ever.
Mr. Lawly started walking in the direction of the river, before stopping suddenly and turning around. The students in front of us followed his lead, making a semi-circle through camp to adjust our course. My guess was that Mr. Lawly was just not ready to face the water again. I couldn’t blame him; I didn’t think I was either.  
So instead of walking along the river we took a route in the opposite direction, to the East of how we hiked to our camp this morning. The terrain was rough and uneven. I had to focus on the ground to keep my balance. Or at least that was what I told myself I was doing, but really I was not ready to face all of the snickers and glares from my still angry class-mates.  
Our hike followed a winding path through a beautiful forest. The trees were thick and the leaves were just beginning to turn colors for fall. The sound of the creek had silenced completely and the only noises we could hear were birds and squirrels or the occasional insect flying too close. I was lost in my own thoughts when I heard Lilly gasp softly. I looked up immediately, not knowing what to expect; maybe Seraphina had organized for me to be taken to the mental institution, or better yet, burned at the stake.  
Instead of physical death, however, it was only physical torture. Kiran and Talbott had stopped walking and were apparently waiting for us to catch up. I glanced at Lilly to see her porcelain cheeks stained red from blushing. I didn’t understand what she saw in Talbott, but as his cheeks were an equal shade of crimson, I’m guessing he also saw that same something in her.
“That was some temper tantrum back there, Love,” Kiran fell in to step next to me. I was surprised to see Talbott choose to walk next to Lilly instead of Kiran. 
“Back where?” I played ignorant hoping to avoid the conversation and glanced back behind my shoulder. I realized it was impossible, but a girl could hope.
“I told you Seraphina would not appreciate competition,” Talbott said softly, ignoring my sarcasm and joining the conversation.
“I’m not competition. Seraphina can have him,” I growled, frustrated with Kiran,   he was the reason all of this had happened. Seraphina could have him; I was certainly not going to fight over him.
“You’re not competition huh?” Kiran asked softly, letting our arms bump gently together as we walked. “And here I thought you were madly in love with me,” Kiran whispered over-dramatically, his perfect accent articulating each syllable. The electricity under my skin flared for a moment and I felt a surge of heat rush through my body.  
“No, I’m not. Seraphina has nothing to worry about, trust me.”
“Well that just hurts,” Kiran shoved me gently and I realized that he was flirting with me, although I was doing everything in my power to disengage him.
“Stop it,” I commanded firmly. “You’re going to get me into more trouble. Just leave me alone so Seraphina will leave me alone.”
“That’s not very likely on either account,” Kiran mumbled. “Besides, you’re done for now. I wouldn’t be surprised if the whole class wasn’t plotting their revenge.”    
“Well, you could at least stop,” Talbott looked directly at Kiran, but his tone was hopeless.
“Yes, you could stop,” I repeated and gave him an irritated glance.
“Yes, I could stop, but then I wouldn’t have any fun,” Kiran whined defensively. “If I left you alone, who is going to blow things up when they get nervous? Or nearly drown thirty people in a poor attempt at vengeance? I can’t count on any of them to do it.” He pointed his chin towards the group of students walking in front of us.
“Very funny,” I responded dryly.
“Really though, you need to control your magic. You are out of control,” Talbott said seriously, although I knew he was only mocking me.  
“If only it was that simple,” I muttered under my breath.
“Well you could at least try; I think the teachers are going to stop believing that it is all accidental behavior, especially when you involve them in your anecdotes,” Talbott was always the advice-giver, if only he had a solution as well.
“You’re right about that. But I think when that happens, when they finally stop believing it’s all on accident, they will finally send me where I belong,” I laughed bitterly.
“Oh yeah? And where is that?” Kiran asked.
“The loony bin,” everyone probably assumed the worst now anyways; I couldn’t hide the fact that I was crazy any longer. 
“I told you, you’re not crazy,” Kiran put a protective hand on my shoulder, sending both butterflies and electricity soaring inside of me. After today’s outburst and the strength of energy I felt in the river, at least the electricity had become easier to control.
“Oh right….” Sarcasm dripped from my voice, “This is completely normal behavior; all teenage girls can empty riverbeds with just the touch of their hand.”
“It is normal behavior if you go to this….” But Kiran didn’t get to finish his sentence. All of a sudden I was hit in the face with a giant ball of earth. Rocks, dirt, mud and leaves splattered all over my face, into my mouth and covered my hair.  
I was blinded for what seemed like minutes as I tried to scrape the mud from my eyes, nostrils and tongue. Not only did it hurt, but it was also disgusting. My mouth was open when the attack came, meaning I had eaten and tasted more than anyone’s fair share of dirt for the day.  
I could feel the mud caked in my hair, in my eyelashes, up my nose, and I thought there was even some in my ears. I was sure Seraphina was the one to thank for this, although I couldn’t be positive because I never saw who threw the mud ball in the first place, and I certainly couldn’t see anything now. I coughed up rocks and leaves, gagging violently, doing everything in my power to keep from puking. A few wet clothes did not even compare to the grossness of this retaliation.
“You could have helped her,” I heard Talbott accuse Kiran.
“If I would have seen it coming, I would have gladly taken the bullet for her,” Kiran said bravely, while laughing hysterically.
“Thanks a lot jackass,” I grumbled threw bouts of spitting out mud. I heard Mr. Lawly yell something about keeping up with the rest of the group; clearly he thought this prank was well deserved.
“I wish I had a towel or something to give you,” Lilly offered helplessly. “Would you like some leaves or something?”  
“Yea, I guess,” wishing more than ever I had worn a sweatshirt; instead of just a tank top and jeans. I thought about using my socks, as unpleasant as that sounded.
“Here, you can use my shirt,” Kiran finally decided to be a gentleman. He handed me the red cotton polo he was wearing and I cringed while using it to wipe off my face. After glancing down at the expensive designer tag, I felt guilty for punishing the poor thing by turning it into a filthy rag.
“Thanks,” I mumbled into the shirt, peeking out from behind it to make sure I hadn’t left him shirtless. Thankfully, he was wearing a white V-neck undershirt.  
I wiped as much off with Kiran’s shirt as I could, feeling the dirtiest I had ever felt. Since Lilly, Talbott and Kiran waited with me while I cleaned up, we had to walk a little faster than before in order to catch up with the rest of the group.  
Not sure what to do with Kiran’s polo now that it was completely ruined; I held it awkwardly in my hands. I glanced up and gave him a sheepish grin. I could feel small pebbles and bits of mud still in my mouth, so my grin quickly turned to disgust and I tried to spit it out as quickly as humanly possible. Not very lady like, but what other option did I have?  
“You just invite trouble, don’t you?”  Kiran goaded, but handed me a water bottle I hadn’t noticed him carrying before. I took it, very grateful I was able to rinse my mouth out.
“Looks like it,” I said through bouts of gurgling and spitting.  
“What are we going to do with you?” he laughed again lightly.
“Ugh. Mud tastes awful,” I changed the subject to what was really on my mind. The constant grinding of dirt and pebbles between my teeth had me beyond nauseous.   
“How are you going to get them back?” Kiran apparently lived for my humiliation.
“Are you kidding? I’m not. I would like this all to just end,” I nearly whined.
“What? With your kind of power, they’re no match for you.”  
“Thanks for reminding me what a freak I am,” I was all of a sudden irritated. “This thing is ruining my life; I’m certainly not going to use it against anyone else.” 
“Don’t be such a baby. Seraphina could never have done that with the water and she certainly hasn’t held back against you. You could get her back so good. Come on, rain down hell!”  Kiran pushed.
“I’m not just here for your entertainment. And isn’t she your girlfriend?” I spit harsher than I had intended, electricity building with every emotion. “I can’t control what is happening to me and it’s not some joke for you to use to pit me against Seraphina. You are crazy if you think we are going to battle it out all over you,” I picked up my pace and refused to look back at him.  
“You’re wrong, you can control it,” Kiran yelled after me. That was not really the point I had hoped to leave with him and that irritated me even more. What stung the worst however was that Lilly stayed next to Talbott, leaving me to walk alone through the never-ending wilderness.


Chapter Fourteen


The day ended and slowly the sky turned to dusk. Mr. Lawly had been to every tent, making sure all of our fires were strong and we would be able to make them last through the night. Lilly and I sat around ours on a couple of rocks. Most of the other students were doing the same.  
There were thirty students on the camping trip and all of them were assigned to groups of four, except Lilly and me. Thankfully we were the only two to get a tent to ourselves, well besides Mr. Lawly, but his little one-man lean-to hardly counted.  
All of the tents formed a circle around a large campfire set up in the middle of the clearing, but occasionally Mr. Lawly set up smaller fires closer to the tents. This seemed like a forest fire waiting to happen; but Mr. Lawly was confident he had things under control.  
Some people actually caught fish after we returned from our hike and that was what we were nibbling on now. Our lesson was how to gut and cook a fish over an open flame; I had never done anything more disgusting. I am not exactly sure how this trip was teaching us to survive in the real world.  
I couldn’t think of one situation where I might be stranded in the wilderness and have to depend on fresh fish and berries to survive. Except maybe if I was some type of fugitive on the run or something; I guessed with my track record that didn’t seem so impossible after all. I took a big bite out of my smoked catfish and tried to enjoy the taste of my future.  
Mr. Lawly passed out cans of baked beans and ingredients for s’mores all to be cooked over the fire. I knew that this was the ideal camping cliché but I wasn’t buying it. I was filthy dirty, my long hair was in endless tangles and I was tired of being picked on. I wished I could say I was the outdoorsy type, but I would have done almost anything for a shower right then.
Lilly and I sat silently, consumed with our own thoughts. I pushed the food around on my tarnished tin camping plate and wondered what Seraphina had planned next for me. I looked over at Lilly and saw a small smile on her face, clearly her thoughts were elsewhere and infinitely more enjoyable.  
I wanted so badly to ask her if anything was going on between her and Talbott, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. She had been so great about giving me my privacy that I just couldn’t invade hers. If she wanted to talk about it with me, she would.  
I looked over at Talbott; he was sitting in the middle of all of the “cool kids,” right where he belonged. His olive skin was darker from the sun today and his black curly hair was pushed out of his eyes. His posture was perfect and his white teeth glimmered in the coming darkness. All around him sat equally as beautiful girls staring at him, but he happened to be staring at Lilly. I didn’t understand why he was so tied to that group of followers, clearly he liked Lilly. Was he that much of a robot?
I glanced over at Kiran sitting next to him. He too was staring in our direction and so I quickly looked back at the ground. I didn’t get him, plain and simple. He was apparently dating Seraphina, yet barely had anything to do with her. She was gorgeous and popular; the very girl high school social standards required him to date.  
But me, the social outcast and resident freak, Kiran wouldn’t leave the hell alone!   Either this was just some really messed up game he was playing, or he wasn’t as attached to Seraphina as she was to him. It didn’t really matter which one it was, I was getting sick of being in the middle. And I was definitely tired of providing tonight’s entertainment.
I pulled my knees closer to my chest and laid my head between them. My dark hair spilled over and made a pool on the ground. Normally I would have worried about dragging it through the dirt, but since it was probably dirtier than the ground, I decided not to get upset about it.  
I contemplated revenge against Seraphina, but I couldn’t think of anything legal. I was already in enough trouble with Mr. Lawly anyways and I was pretty sure his list of rules said something about an ongoing prank war being forbidden. A small jolt of electricity shocked my system and made me sit upright; I looked over to see Kiran about five feet away and coming closer…. great.
“Go away,” I picked up a rock and threw it at his legs.
“Don’t be so grumpy,” he caught my rock effortlessly and tossed it back at me.  
“You’re going to get me into trouble again,” I complained, catching the rock and throwing it back at his shoes. He didn’t try to catch it that time, but I doubted he could even feel it through his thick hiking boots.
“You are trouble,” he sat down next to me, a little too close for comfort. Electricity shot like sparks in my veins and gave me goose bumps all the way up my arms. “Listen, I’ve negotiated a cease fire on your behalf. Seraphina has agreed to stop this nonsense as long as you can agree to as well. I think you officially owe me now.”
“I don’t owe you anything, you’re the reason I’m in this mess,” I stood half way up and moved the rock I was sitting on over, away from Kiran. I didn’t need this right now; I didn’t need him right now. And it irritated me that he was right: I was grumpy.
“Eden…” he scolded tauntingly. I couldn’t help but love the sound of my name when he said it with his seductive accent. I laid my head back down between my knees to hide the smile I was having trouble keeping off of my face. The roller coaster his presence sent my emotions on was overwhelming.
“What are the terms?” I asked, my voice muffled underneath my massive amount of hair.
“Oh, right. You leave them alone, they leave you alone.”
That was way too easy. I peaked at them through my wall of black hair and realized that none of them were looking this way. Seraphina and all of her groupies were laughing, but not at me, they were thankfully completely absorbed with themselves. It seemed I had faded into oblivion once again. Thank God.
“What about you? I’m sure this is some breach of contract,” I turned my head to the side and laid my cheek on the tops of my knees, allowing me to have a full view of Kiran. He was still in the white undershirt he was wearing earlier, after I destroyed his polo. The soft, cotton t-shirt clung to his body. His arms were strong, each muscle clearly defined from bicep to forearm. His tanned skin looked faultless in the fading sun; he could not have been more perfect.
“I do what I want Eden, Seraphina knows that and you should too,” he looked directly and deeply into my eyes, causing me to blush.
“So she is really going to leave me alone, even if you won’t?” I asked, not sure if I really wanted him to at that moment. I inhaled deeply through my nose, willing my nervous body to relax.
“Yes of course, I asked her to,” still looking into my eyes, he smiled.
“Oh, I see, your girlfriend obeys your every command.” I asked sarcastically. Obviously he was deluded.
“She is not my girlfriend, but I think you get the gist of it.”
“Sure she’s not,” I rolled my eyes before positioning my face back into my knees. I couldn’t look at him anymore; I was finding it hard to think straight. Energy was vibrating through my heart at an accelerating speed, feeling more and more like a defibrillator.
“She’s not,” he softened his voice and sounded dejected, like he didn’t really believe what he was saying either.
Dusk turned to dark and the air became cool. I was still in my muddy tank top from earlier and shivered under the night breeze. I looked up to notice the fire was getting smaller because of the wind and silently wished I knew how to “kindle” it.
My blood suddenly began to boil and the energy became pin pricks underneath my skin. I felt a little faint and then the fire burst out into a larger version of itself. I stared after it stunned, thankful for the warmth and even more thankful I didn’t injure anyone.  
“Did you do that?” Kiran half laughed at me.
“What? No. That’s weird,” I mumbled, still unable to accept the fact that it was me. I mean, was it me? I was certainly thinking about the fire, my body had the strangest reaction right before it happened; but it couldn’t have been me. A person cannot do things like that. I mean, I may have been a freak, but I was certainly no magician.
Kiran laughed longer. He scooted over closer to me and I realized for the first time, that he was not freaked out by me at all. In fact, in some weird way all of my strangeness was making him more attracted to me. I decided the poor thing loved crazy people.
“What are you laughing at?” I demanded, determined to prove it wasn’t me. The heat felt good on my bare skin and the energy that was strong inside of me just moments before had dwindled down to a soft buzzing.
“I want to know who you are,” Kiran replied cryptically.
“Me too,” I muttered under my breath. He looked over at me and smiled. I was coming to terms with the fact that I was comfortable around him and it actually felt good. He seemed to understand me in a way that I didn’t even understand myself.
“Hey, let’s go for a walk,” he jumped to his feet excitedly; realizing that I had let my guard down, I instantly put it back up.
“Why?” I asked, eyes narrowed, feet planted firmly on the ground.
“Because a walk will be fun, we can explore the great Nebraska Wilderness,” it was hard to say no to his accent, or his eyes, or the child like excitement he was suddenly full of.
“I’m not so sure. Are we even allowed to leave?” I looked over at Mr. Lawly who was exiting his tent, guitar in hand. I panicked a little. There was no way in hell I would be singing “Kumbaya” with this group of people.
“We won’t get into any trouble, I promise. I am pretty sure Mr. Lawly is scared of you,” he smiled wider and I saw he had already made up his mind. Lilly, whom I had nearly forgotten about was looking at me like I was crazy if I didn’t go.
“Fine. Let me get my sweatshirt.” I ducked into my tent and grabbed a gray hooded sweatshirt from one of my old schools out of my backpack. I threw it on over my dirty tank top and knotted my hair high up on my head. I contemplated lip gloss, but quickly disregarded it.
I had no idea what I was thinking saying yes, but I supposed there was no turning back now.


Chapter Fifteen


I exited my tent, energy buzzing and a little nervous, but ready for my walk with Kiran through the woods. I noticed that Talbott and Lilly were standing close together at the edge of the forest, whispering to each other and giggling. Apparently it was a double date.
I exhaled and realized I had been holding my breath. Kiran waited for me by the fire and I joined him, following the ‘love birds’ into the dark woods. Hello “scene from very scary movie.”
I stumbled my way around, unable to see anything through the crowded trees. The night was cloudy, but the high canopy of branches would block out any light from the stars or moon anyways. I stayed close to Lilly, grabbing on to her for support every once in a while. She didn’t seem to have any problem making her way in the dark; in fact, none of them did. I was the only one staggering around blindly.
I had always scared easily and so this scenario without a doubt had me terrified. Every little noise, every little break of a twig and I was nearly jumping out of my skin. I couldn’t remember why I had thought this was such a good idea. An owl hooted nearby and I let out a tiny scream.
“Calm down Eden, I was only kidding when I told you there were bears out here,” Kiran sounded slightly exasperated and I couldn’t blame him. I was pathetic.
“I know.... I’m fine,” I tried to sound confident, but my voice wavered.
“There’s nothing to worry about,” Kiran walked from the other side of Talbott and Lilly to be next to me, and put his hand on my arm, steadying me. “I won’t let anything happen to you,” he leaned in to whisper, but I could hear the sarcasm in his voice.
“Thank you, but I am just fine,” I ripped my arm out of his hand a little too dramatically.
“All right, suit yourself,” he didn’t attempt to touch me again, but he didn’t leave my side either.
We wandered silently through the dense wilderness. The night was very still, even the animals and insects had seemed to quiet down. The sky was overcast, but every once in a while the moon would break through the clouds and shine down an eerie glow around us.
I began to relax after my eyes had adjusted and I could see where I was going a little better. Lilly and Talbott had managed to walk ahead of us; I could hear them talking quietly. I smiled at how relaxed Lilly was around Talbott; they seemed to be really good for each other. I thought Lilly might even have made Talbott relax a little as well.
“I think he would leave me for her,” Kiran said softly.
“I didn’t realize you two were a couple,” I smirked, satisfied with my insult.
“Oh, you think that’s funny do you?” Kiran laughed out loud and then reached over to tickle me. I stumbled in the dark, trying to get away from him but tripped. Electricity began to steadily hum underneath my skin as I took Kiran down with me, falling to the ground.
He sat up and shoved my shoulder gently with the palm of his hand. I could tell he was getting ready to say something but suddenly I felt a surge of electricity that I could barely control. I slammed my hand over his mouth, every one of my muscles on edge.
We had been walking for a while, maybe thirty minutes and we were pretty far from camp. We had come to a dead end of sorts as our path was blocked by a tall cliff and wall of boulders. We would have had to change directions to continue on our walk.
The energy abruptly surging through my blood warned me that we were not alone. I hesitated, wondering if maybe Seraphina or one of her minions followed us, but I usually could recognize the level of electricity brought on by another Kingsley student. The pulsing energy I felt now alarmed me of a greater danger.
“Lilly, Talbott get down!” I half whispered, half shouted. They obeyed instantaneously, and I was surprised they didn’t ask any immediate questions.
“What is going on?” Kiran wiggled out from underneath my firm grasp, talking at full volume.
“Shh,” I whispered with force. “I heard something, or felt something....  something is definitely not right,” I was as confused as I sounded. The hairs stood straight up on my arms and the back of my neck. I didn't know how, but I knew something was terribly wrong.
“You’re right,” Kiran’s voice had softened to a whisper now and he crawled into a crouching position. “Talbott do you feel that?”
“Yes I do. I think we should get you back to camp,” Talbott was suddenly next to us, along with Lilly. His arm rested protectively on Kiran and he had positioned his body in front of him. I was surprised to see that Lilly had also taken a defensive crouch blocking Kiran’s rear.
Electricity began rushing through my veins, sending my senses reeling. At first the sensation made me nauseous, but I adjusted quickly. The very first awareness I noticed was how vivid my eyesight became. Everything around me sharpened into the clearest image, as though I was in the middle of daylight, only more intense. I could see everything now, every animal hidden up high in the trees, every insect crawling, and every speck of dust on the ground.
The electricity pounding through my veins was intense, but it was also focused. Every one of my senses was heightened in an unnatural way: my sense of smell, my sense of sight, hearing, touch and even taste. I felt another sense as well; although it was unfamiliar and unidentifiable to me, I knew it existed and I was suddenly aware of how to use it.
My sixth sense, as it were, was hypersensitive to the physical nature of the world outside of myself. I could feel everything move around me. I could feel the leaves move in the trees from the light breeze, and the rocks crunch under oncoming feet. I felt the moon in the sky and the stars that were millions of light years away. I felt the center of the earth pulsating with the rhythm of the universe.
And then I realized that we were not alone. The change in my nature was a result of other people surrounding us. I could “feel” distinct entities making their way towards us, trying to be discreet. Each individual carried their own dissimilar electrical field, warning me of their approach.
“Someone’s coming!” I whispered fiercely, but by the tense and crouched postures of my friends, I knew they already realized this. I could feel the negative aura of the oncoming force. Whoever they were, they meant us harm.    
Before we could react, we were surrounded. Five hooded figures stood surrounding us, faces all masked. If it were not for my heightened sense I would have assumed this was another practical joke, but the focused energy surging through my veins told me that this was a very dangerous threat. The heat in my blood readied me for battle, and I barely recognized myself.  
I looked at Kiran; he stood to his feet, arms wide, and ready to fight. Adrenaline pumped through my bloodstream, allowing me to feel no fear, but did nothing for my confusion. I glanced at Talbott and Lilly and to my surprise they had both taken the same stance as Kiran. I had no idea who these people were, but realized a fight was imminent.
Lilly stood with her back facing Kiran as if to protect him from a rear attack. She looked miniscule alongside Talbott and Kiran. Even our attackers were large and tall figures. Although I couldn’t be for sure that they were all men by the way they were dressed, but if I had to have guessed I would have assumed they were.
I positioned myself in the protective circle with the rest of my friends, unsure of what I was capable of. I would do anything to protect these people, but if push came to shove, I realized I was going to be the one that needed protecting. I mimicked their stances, hoping someone would shout out instructions.
The fight would happen at any moment, of that I was sure. The only thing we were waiting on was for someone to make the first move. I considered rushing one of the men in black, but decided it was probably too risky and definitely too stupid.
We stared at each other for what seemed like an hour. I had never witnessed a fight except on TV, and although I expected for them to pull out guns or some other type of weapon, nothing appeared. They clearly pursued us, but I was unclear of how they would begin their attack. Instead of a weapons fight however, something so unexplainable happened that I could only stand there staring at all of those around me, mouth opened wide.
The cloaked figures had surrounded us on every side. We had our backs towards each other, in a protective circle around Kiran. The tension was thick and my muscles twitched in anticipation.
Finally the first move was made; it was like nothing I had ever seen happen in my life. One of the masked men jumped forward into the air, seemingly trying to hurdle over Talbott to reach Kiran. Although the jump at first appeared impossible, as soon as his body was lifted off of the ground he inexplicably transformed into a mountain lion.  My mouth dropped open and I shook my head frantically, unwilling to believe that what I thought I saw actually happened.
To my amazement though, instead of getting torn to shreds, Kiran met him in the air, forcing him to the ground underneath him. They were not alone for more than a millisecond before Talbott jumped into the wrestling match pounding the human turned animal until he bled.
I hoped that this was the end of it, but there were four other cloaked beings surrounding us and I had an ominous feeling this fight was far from over. Two more of the strange men immediately transformed into similarly dangerous animals to assist their friend; one a bobcat, the other a leopard. Snarling, growling and biting, they attacked Kiran and Talbott over and over. I watched, with disbelieving eyes at a fight that seemed doomed.
The animals ripped into their skin, biting, clawing, tearing away pieces of flesh, but I never saw blood. I used my heightened sense to search for the terrifying sight of torn and bloodied flesh but could not find it. My stomach lurched at the sight of Talbott and Kiran in a battle for their lives, but I remained a bystander unsure of how to help. 
My mind refused to process what I could feel was reality around me. Lilly let out a battle cry of her own, jumping into the air and turning herself into a tigress. Her animal form maintained her petite size and the vibrant red color of her hair, but her claws and teeth had suddenly become the most ferocious weapons I had ever seen. She joined the fight, tearing and biting the other animals involved. I covered my mouth with my hand, unable to move, paralyzed by confusion.
Kiran threw the mountain lion off of him with such an unimaginable force; the animal was thrown at least thirty feet away. Quickly the animal, once a man, was back on his feet taking three quick bounds and jumping back into the fray. Talbott was desperate to keep the animals away from Kiran, throwing one, and then two off of him, but they were persistent, always returning with even more vigor.
The two remaining masked men remained men, but were none the less dangerous. They joined the fight as well, uprooting trees and hurling large boulders at my tiring friends. They had yet to touch anything however, accomplishing it all with what seemed to be just an outstretched hand.
The fight was creating a clearing of its own in the once crowded forest. Trees and boulders were constantly hurled at my friends, some finding their mark; some stopped midair and dropped to the ground by a mere glance from Kiran. The only problem was that the animals continued to attack him, making it impossible for him to see every obstruction coming his way. My friends were being beaten to death and I still stood there helpless.  
I swallowed the bile rising in my throat and I couldn’t help the feeling of panic washing over me. I had been forgotten, a simple bystander to the unreal destruction happening all around me. My tired and outnumbered friends were frantic to win their survival but the attacking men seemed even more bent on their demolition.
My blood was hot with electricity surging through my veins, my heart beating wildly out of control. My fingers and muscles twitched with the desire to join and my senses heightened to a crystal clear state. I inhaled deeply of the battle around me and I realized that I wasn’t helpless.
And then it dawned on me. The energy coursing through my veins must be the same force with which these men were using. Its very nature sharpened into a treacherous weapon by their presence. I could feel anticipation mingled with bloodlust as though the electricity itself were a life form. I had never felt more empowered as the electricity I had tried to oppress for so long rushed through my blood giving me a sense of strength I had never experienced before.
I forced my mind to focus on the fight, appreciating that all of my senses were already finely in tuned. I watched as mammal ripped flesh from mammal, and masked men performed feats of strength that should have been utterly impossible. Kiran and Talbott seemed to possess the same power that the two remaining humans did; the landscape around us was ripped to pieces as they tried to destroy one another.
I tested my own strength with a nearby rock. I willed it to be lifted into the air with my mind and the small bolder obeyed easily. I decided the course of destruction and the rock flew through the air crashing into pieces against a small tree. Again I tested my strength with the same tree, ripping it out of the ground and lifting it easily into the air; its limbs and roots hung precariously over the two standing strangers. With a thought, I dropped the tree onto them and watched as they were crushed beneath it. I heard the revolting crunch of bones breaking as they were buried beneath the branches.
The men did not give up however, and threw the tree off of their mangled bodies scrambling to their feet, bones completely restored. My mind refused to believe what my senses had already accepted as reality. Again I tested my strength, electricity building with every mental movement.
Merely thinking of a basketball sized boulder, I lifted it with my mind, the energy growing even stronger and hurled it with all of the mental power I had at the nearest shrouded figure. Everyone had written me off, clearly I had been frozen by fear, but as terrifying as my new found powers were, I was the only hope we had for victory.
The man I hit was not expecting an attack from me, and I realized they did not comprehend where the first tree I dropped on them came from. I hit him directly in the temple, causing a sickening skull-crushing thud. He lost his balance and fell over, letting out a scream of frustration.
For just a second Kiran had the upper hand and brought another tree branch down on him. Momentarily he was trapped, until the other standing figure reached out his arms sending Kiran flying through the air in the opposite direction and isolating him from the rest of the mêlée. 
I decided to try the same effect, and it was my turn to send the other attacker flying. I was more than angry, I was furious. All of the energy building up inside of me had come to an alarming climax, I let it loose on this one man, sending him thirty feet away and head first into a thick tree. I expected the energy to dissipate after releasing so much at one time, but it rushed back through my blood stronger and more powerful, sanctioning me to do more damage.
I saw the battle clearly, more clearly than I had seen anything else in my life. It was as if I was created specifically for that moment. The deathly encounter made me more alive than I had ever felt. I could no longer fight against my ingrained electricity, but worked with it to wield the destruction I saw all around me. The energy rushing through my body set me on a war path, my blood turning to an uncontrollable fire, and I found that I was willing to fight at any cost to win the battle. 
I took a moment to assess the situation around me. Lilly, although in the form of a tiger had her back to the cliff wall, trapped by both the leopard and the mountain lion. She was a capable fighter, but the two animals were closing in on her and I knew it wouldn’t be long.
Kiran had come face to face with the very man I threw and they were circling each other, both waiting for the other to make the first move. Talbott was in a wrestling match with the bobcat and had barely escaped his throat being ripped out twice. It was only a matter of time.
The man I trapped underneath the tree branch had thrown it off and was standing, ready to attack me. I took this all in, in a single breath, but understood with certainty that this fight could not last any longer. We were outnumbered and they would not stop until each one of us was dead.
I gathered the energy inside of me, letting it build and build. The man who had intended to attack me slowed to a stop and tried his attack at a distance. The electricity in my blood became a sort of energy field around me, blocking the attacks from the cloaked man standing only a few feet away.
I felt myself growing stronger with every small molecule of electricity in my veins. I took energy from everything around me; borrowing from the trees, the ground, the stars, the moon, the very breeze that remained soft despite our deathly battle. I sensed myself becoming an unstoppable force. Even my enemies couldn’t hold on to their own energy as I took it from them and added it to my own.
My body was nearly bursting. I had created such a force of energy, I could barely contain it. I looked around again and saw all of my friends in imminent danger, unaware of the oncoming storm I was about to rain down.
With controlled thoughts and determined power, I let loose my building tempest. Every cloaked being was sent flying through the air, all coming to rest in one final heap on the ground. I felt their energies dissipate quickly and their lifeless bodies move no more.
Four bodies, piled carelessly on top of each other in the middle of our destruction were the evidence of what I was capable of. One of the attackers however was able to escape. He did not wait around to be certain of his friend’s fate, but fled through the woods; his energy growing fainter and fainter the farther away he ran.
Only one of them escaped through the forest, only one of the five. I could sense each of his feet hit the hard ground and his body panic from the terrifying image I ingrained into his mind until eventually he faded away completely.
There was no way I could catch him now, my body had no more strength to move. I collapsed onto the ground, shaking in violent tremors. I lifted my head to see Kiran, Talbott and Lilly back in her human form, were all alive. I rejoiced silently, unable to even say anything. They stared at me with the strangest mix of emotions on their face, all hesitating to move.


Chapter Sixteen


I might as well have been drained of all life. The strength I expelled to put an end to the fighting was more than I knew I was capable of; not to mention all of the other crazy stuff that I didn’t know anyone was capable of. I lay on the hard ground, barely able to lift my head, let alone my limp limbs.
I was aware of what just happened; a small part of me accepted that the events that occurred were in fact real. But the fight I partook in only moments ago felt more like a distant memory than reality: like a dream I just woke up from and could barely remember. The exact details of everything were fading from my mind quickly and I wasn't sure I cared.
“One got away,” my voice came out hoarse and shaky. I pointed in the direction I felt him run in before he disappeared from the tracking device I knew was my mind.
“Talbott, go,” Kiran demanded, rushing over to my side and kneeling down. He leaned in close to my face, seemingly examining my pupils, although I had a hard time believing he really knew what he was doing. He took my hand into his and held it tightly in his grasp.
“I can’t leave you. Damn it. We should have brought the entire Guard, damn it Kiran,” Talbott yelled. “I knew this was a bad idea. Damn it,” he repeated over and over and started to walk in circles. “Kiran are you alright?”
“I’m fine,” Kiran looked down at me concerned. He inspected me again by lifting up my arms and head, looking for, well I didn’t really know what he was looking for, but he eventually seemed satisfied. All the while, he never let go of my hand.
“Damn it Kiran, are you all right?” Talbott shouted at him louder. I watched Talbott continue to pace back and forth from my peripheral. I could tell that he wanted to pursue the attacker, chase him down. I could also tell by the way he glanced at Kiran every other second he was not going to leave his friend alone.
“Yes, I’m fine, I’m really fine,” Kiran spoke louder and with confidence. I saw Talbott relax his shoulders a little, but continue to pace. “Lilly go back to camp and tell Mr. Lawly that we have to leave now!” Kiran demanded of the human-again Lilly. She did not speak a word, but obediently took off running through the forest, her bright red hair disappearing into the darkness.
The logical part of me objected to Lilly trying to make it back to camp by herself. The attacker could still be out there, he could have easily circled around to our other side to finish the job and I was too exhausted to pick him up with my new found powers. After what just happened, somebody should go with her, whether he was out there or not. I was too weak to contest. I tried to verbalize my concerns, but only a moan came out.  
“She will be fine,” Kiran looked into my eyes intensely and I saw his passion and concern. “Lilly can take care of herself it turns out. She will have no problem making it back to camp.” Kiran’s voice was soothing and calm; it felt like medicine to my fried nerves.
“I don’t think you should be so close to her,” Talbott stood over us, gruffly assessing our position.
“She just saved our lives,” Kiran growled.
“And look at what she did to everyone else,” Talbott was calm, but I heard the tension back in his voice. Kiran looked around and let go of my hand to stand up. I began fading in and out of consciousness, fighting to stay awake, but the fatigue was making it impossible.  
“Have you ever seen this before?” Kiran asked Talbott, and I knew they were talking about me. My eyes had closed and I was breathing evenly, I was not even sure if I was conscious anymore.
“No, never. I had no idea she was capable of this. I had no idea anyone was capable of this. Four Immortals at once…… it doesn’t make sense,” Talbott replied.  
“I thought you said that she wasn’t one of your kind?” Kiran asked softly.
“She’s not. She’s not….” Talbott repeated. “We must tell your father immediately, she is clearly a security threat. Kiran, she did not even realize she had this kind of power. What else is she capable of?” Talbott sounded almost scared, and I began to lose awareness completely.
“No, that is the last thing we are going to do. You will tell him nothing of her power. Do you understand?” Kiran’s voice started to fade, “That is an order Talbott.”
I knew they were talking about me, and talking about what I did, but I didn’t understand what they were saying. Clearly I wasn’t as much of a freak as I thought I was, because they were capable of the same things. I was just lucky enough to be overlooked at first. Surely any one of them would have been able to do what I did with more power and quicker.
I began to regain lucidness as reality set in. I tried to process what just happened, but I could not wrap my mind around it. I saw human beings, real human beings, turn into animals. I saw Lilly turn into an animal. And these were no ordinary mammals; they turned into dangerous creatures thirsty for blood. Human beings posed as animals trying to rip each other apart.
I saw men move things with their minds. I saw them try to kill each other without ever touching the other. Their strength being one thousand times more dangerous without ever physically coming into contact with one another than any other human being I had ever seen. The power these men wielded was beyond comprehension; but these were not just strangers, Kiran and Talbott were capable of the same feats of extraordinary. Kiran and Talbott, only teenagers, were capable of murder, even if it was self-defense.
And then I realized that it wasn’t just them that did those things, it was me. I moved things with my mind. I hurt people. I killed people. I was capable of everything the others were, if not more. And I finished it all.
A rock seemed to drop in my stomach and I was suddenly sick. I sat up quickly and emptied everything I had eaten that day on the ground next to me. My body shook violently as it tried to rid my mind of the crimes I just committed. The electricity in me was not only powerful, it was evil.  
What had I done? How could I have killed anyone? And not just one person, but four? I pulled my knees to my chest and began to cry, fully awake, but fully unaware of what was happening around me. I drowned out any sound nearby with my sobs. I wanted it so badly to be a dream that I could wake up from, but there was the terrifying fact that I just lived through a real life nightmare I would never be able to forget.

----

Somehow I made it back to camp, either Kiran or Talbott carried me, I wasn’t sure who. Between sobbing and blacking out I didn’t remember much. My body was so weak that I was barely able to lift my hands, let alone walk or sit up. My voice was hoarse and my throat on fire. When I was conscious I either cried or puked. Unconsciousness was a sweet black hole of nothingness my body and mind longed for.
Mr. Lawly already had the campsite cleaned up before we arrived back at camp. All of the tents and equipment had been packed up and the students organized to leave. I heard people talking around me, but I couldn’t understand their words. I was unable to comprehend anything; the only sounds I truly understood were that of my own uncontrollable sobbing.
Someone carried me the entire way back to the bus which was running and waiting for our arrival. A hike that took over an hour just that morning seemed to take only minutes on the way back. We were loaded onto the bus and I was deposited in the very back, left alone to sob as silently as I could.
If only the extreme force of the energy I held were enough to cope with tonight it would have been enough. But it wasn’t just that, my friends were attacked tonight, attacked by people who had intended to kill us. I had to watch my friends fight for their very survival.
I was physically weak and inundated. But the realization of what I had done to other people, enemy or not was the truly crushing reality. I took four lives tonight.  No one asked me to, and no one else could be held responsible. With the suggestion of no other person I chose to destroy those people. Despite the fact that I saved my friends lives in return for theirs, the truth remains: I was a murderer.
They weren’t even ordinary men, they were men like me. Whatever I was, they were. They possessed the same energy, the same electricity; we were the same, and I killed them. Their lives are over and for all I knew they were still laying there, piled on top of each other, in the middle of the wilderness.
I continued to sob until I was at last too exhausted to even cry and fell into a deep, dreamless sleep. I could finally feel nothing and think no more. The sweet rest seemed to last forever and consumed my whole consciousness. I was aware of the bus arriving back at school, and I was aware of being taken to my aunt’s car, but through it all I refused to open my eyes and acknowledge reality.
Somehow, someone eventually placed me in my bed. It was there, under my thick comforters and surrounded by soft, feather pillows, that I let the sweet nothingness consume me entirely. I would have been perfectly happy to never wake up again. But of course, that was asking for far too much.

----

After what seemed like days of sleeping I finally could not keep my eyes closed any longer. Although if it had been up to me; I would never have opened them again. But fighting against my selfishness was the conscious knowledge that I had a moral responsibility to pay the consequences of my actions. I sighed deeply and contemplated whether I wanted to get out of bed or just call down for Aunt Syl.  
The warm sunlight from my bedroom windows enveloped me as I lay on my overly soft, overly large bed. I was wrapped in warm blankets and surrounded by my favorite pillows. I rubbed my eyes as they adjusted to the light they hadn’t seen for what seemed like a very long time. I could feel how puffy and swollen they were, a consequence of the large amounts of sobbing I had accomplished lately.  
I started to sit up, but still felt drained of all energy. I laid my head back down and wished I could stay there forever. I tried to swallow, but my throat was dry and scratchy. I didn’t attempt to move, unquenchable thirst seemed the least of my problems.
“Aunt Syl,” I called out, but my voice was nothing more than a harsh whisper.
“Shh…” she responded, entering my room with a glass of water in hand. Either she was a mind-reader or just a very good person. I sat up a tiny bit, taking the water from her. “I figured you would get up soon, and I thought you would need this,” I took a small sip and my eyes filled with tears; for being both grateful for the water and for having to face her.
I realized that she had been sitting just outside my door, waiting for me to get up. I wondered how long I had been asleep and how long she had been sitting there. I couldn’t hold back my tears as I thought about the pain I must be causing her. How could I explain any of this to her?
I gratefully gulped the glass of water down, spilling it all over my face and on my surrounding covers. I tried to speak again, but this time no sound came out. Tears continued to spill from my eyes and I hung my head in shame. Aunt Syl soon started crying as well.
She took the water from my hands and set it down on my night stand. Still crying she pulled me into her arms and hugged me, rubbing my back with her hand. She had never felt like much of a mother type before, but at that moment it was exactly what I needed. I felt like a small child, unable to comprehend anything that was going on outside of my own feelings.
“It’s alright Eden, everything is going to be alright,” she cooed soothingly, pulling my shoulders away from her and staring directly into my face. She brushed the tears away from my eyes and then her own eyes as well. She handed me a tissue from her pocket and I gratefully wiped my face with it. “There is someone here who needs to speak with you,” She tried to smile reassuringly, but I saw the trepidation in her eyes.
Without being asked, a man entered my room and cleared his throat. I looked up to see Principal Saint standing in my doorway, looking very grim. All of the horrors of the previous night rushed back to me and I was filled with dread. A sense of foreboding gripped my nervous system, and the tingling electricity filled my veins once again.


Chapter Seventeen


“Hello, Eden,” Principal Saint said in his usual distinguished voice, then cleared his throat. “I am glad that you are feeling better.”
He assumed I was feeling better without even asking. I was not feeling better, I was feeling worse. The cloaked figures passed through my mind again and I bit my lip to hold back the tears. A wave of nausea crept over me and I glanced around in search of a trash can.
“First things first, those men are not dead,” Principal Saint continued. He paused as if waiting for his words to sink in. “They may have appeared that way to you, but Talbott was able to revive them. They were simply unconscious. You children were very lucky to have survived such a brutal attack.” He cleared his throat again. Principal Saint was a very tall man, and since he had not moved from my door way he appeared overly large and intimidating in his double breasted, brown, tweed suit.
“They were dead, I know they were dead,” I protested. “I killed them,” I looked down and covered my face with my hands. I couldn’t hold back the choking sobs.
“Eden it’s alright, what Dr. Saint says is true,” My aunt put her hand against my cheek and spoke in a soothing manner. I looked up at her unbelieving. “There are a lot of things that have happened to you that need to be explained,” she continued, “Amory would like to talk with you, and maybe shed some light on all that has been happening recently,” she gave me an encouraging smile and stood to leave. I grabbed her hand unwilling to be left alone with him.
“I saw those men lying on the ground. They were dead. I know they were dead,” I struggled to speak through my tears, my voice was deep and course, but I refused to believe them. I committed a horrible act, and I knew that I must pay for my actions. They were not going to sugar coat it for me. Surely the police would be here any minute anyways.
“Eden, the police are not coming,” Principal Saint seemed to read my mind and answer my very thoughts. His voice was more constrained and I could see that he was frustrated with me. “The police will never be involved. We have our own way of dealing with issues such as these. Now trust me, those men were not dead. They probably appeared that way to you, maybe even felt that way; but as I said before, Talbott was able to revive them and they are currently being held for questioning.”
“Why didn’t you call the police? Those men are dangerous. They tried to hurt us, they tried to kill us!” I was fully ready to face the consequences for homicide; but I was also more than ready to plead self-defense. As awful as I felt for taking another man’s life, I did realize that it was necessary. The fact that these men were not even in police custody made my actions meaningless.
“Trust me, those men are in custody. However, it is a different type of legal system than you may be used to. I’m afraid they will face a judge and jury very soon. A trial has been set for them and they will face their accusers soon enough,” a look of sadness passed across Principal Saint’s face and I was not sure if it was meant for me or for the men who would stand trial.
“So I will get to testify against them?” I asked, unsure if I was even ready to face them again.  
“No, absolutely not. That is out of the question,” Principal Saint reacted quickly. I was instantly confused, but before I could ask any more questions, he continued, “What I mean to say is that Kiran Kendrick and Talbott Angelo will act as both witness and prosecution. Their testimonies will be more than enough to seal your attacker’s fate. Trust me,” Principal Saint wore the same look of sadness he had a few moments ago and I was positive this time it was meant for the attackers.
“But why can’t I speak on my own behalf?” I felt obstinate; those men tried to kill my friends.
“Haven’t you been through enough? Besides the trial will take place in Romania.”
“Romania?” I blurted out, much louder than I had intended. “What does Romania have to do with what happened here… in Nebraska? Isn’t there something about jurisdiction or international law or something?” I was now completely confused. Surely a Romanian court system could care less about what happened to a bunch of teenagers in the middle of America.
“They will not be tried by a Romanian court system,” Principal Saint once again answered the questions in my head and I was sure now that he was reading my thoughts. “We have our own judicial system and they will answer to us. Like I said, their fate, I’m sure, will be much worse than any human justice system is prepared to give them, trust me,” Principal Saint looked down at his shoes and shook his head slightly as if ashamed.
“Ok, I have no idea what you are talking about,” I looked at Aunt Syl, hoping she would shed some light on this bewildering conversation. “You are really starting to freak me out.”
“It’s alright Eden. You need to start trusting me,” he approached the bed and pulled my desk chair closer so that he could sit near me. My aunt stood up and crossed the room to look out my window. My throat began to close in nervous anticipation. “Sylvia would you make us some tea? This might be harder than I imagined." Aunt Syl left the room silently and obeyed.
“How do you know what’s been happening to me? How do you know what I’m thinking? What do you mean by our justice system?” my questions tumbled out quickly and all at once. Principal Saint obviously knew much more about what was happening to me than I did.
“What is happening to you is completely normal,” when I rolled my eyes he continued, “Well it’s completely expected anyway. It’s completely expected for someone in your position,” he clarified. “You see Eden; you are special, very special.”
	“If by special you mean crazy and this is some sort of weird intervention then just let me know where you are sending me and get on with it!” I couldn’t hold back my tears this time; they came in waves of choking sobs. All of my fears and anxiety finally manifested themselves in a very real manner. The strange things that had been happening to me and the inexplicable things I was responsible for were not normal, but more than that, they were scary.
“You are not crazy,” Principal Saint replied a little disdainfully, but even more impatiently. “You did the only thing that anyone would expect you to do and that was to protect yourself and your friends. From what I’ve heard it was a very dangerous situation; you are lucky to be alive,” he said this with finality, as though this should be enough. “And I will say it again, you are not crazy. You drained those men of their magic; it was not a pretty task, but a necessary one,” he paused to let his words sink in. “I’m sure the magnitude of force you used on those men felt like murder, it probably felt worse to them, but Talbott was able to revive them. They are in custody now and soon we will find out what their exact purpose was. Then we will know why they attacked you children…. although I am sure I already have a reason in mind.” 
“Drained them of their magic? What are you talking about?” I asked, highly irritated. I thought I was the crazy one? My emotions were at a level I had never experienced before and I felt as if I were on the verge of a breakdown; maybe I’d been on the verge for a while and this was finally the breaking point I’d been waiting for.
“Yes Eden, magic. I am sure you are aware that you are different from other humans, that you possess a set of skills that appear…. super-human. We have all been a witness to your erratic and unexplainable behavior; and after last night you can no longer deny it to yourself. I had hoped that somehow through your experiences you would become aware of what your powers are capable of and see that others around you possess the same set of skills. However, I see now how stubborn and self-absorbed you can be and can wait no longer. If something were to happen like this again, you need to be aware of what you are capable of,” he was a stern man, and I didn’t know whether to feel offended, shocked, or like a fool. This had to be some type of joke.
“This is not a joke,” he said louder, and with more conviction. “Open your eyes, Eden,” he shook his head and I knew he was frustrated with me.
“Amory, please, she’s just a child,” my aunt entered the room again carrying a tray of hot tea. She handed me a steaming cup and I took it from her gratefully. “This is new to her, she’s never been around anything your people can do until now; of course she’s going to deny it, to her it doesn’t make sense,” she walked over to hand Principal Saint his cup of tea, but turned back to address me soothingly, “It didn’t make sense to me either the first time I saw what your people could do,” Aunt Syl sat back down with me on the bed and put an arm across my shoulders. I knew that I should feel comforted by her gesture, but my mind was still reeling.
“What are you talking about?” I asked, my head spinning.
“Eden, I am not your real aunt,” Aunt Syl began. And Principal Saint gave a small chuckle. “You were given to me at a very young age after your parents had disappeared, I never knew them; I have always told you that, and that has always been true. But you see, we’re different, you are extremely special and I am only human,” she smiled at me and something stirred deep inside my soul, something that told me I should listen closer.
“You keep saying that I’m special, that I’m different, that I’m not crazy, but what does that mean?” I demanded; it was my turn to become impatient.
“Like I said earlier, you possess a set of skills that make you more than human, that make you different,” Principal Saint rejoined the conversation.
“If you’re talking about how I am able to burn down school buildings, or create tidal waves, or make things explode, then yes, I suppose I do possess a certain set of skills; but the last thing I wanted was for any of that to happen,” I folded my arms across my chest and shook my head. I was relieved in a sense that someone would finally be able to tell me what had been happening to me; but even more, I was angry that they felt the need to wait this long.
“Well, I suppose that’s part of it. But a better example would be what happened last night,” Principal Saint’s tone had softened. “You see all of the things that happened before, when your school flooded, or burned down, or you made a trashcan explode in the theater, oh yes, we know about that, those were all manifestations of your magic. Eden, you have refused to use your powers, you continue to ignore their very existence. Because of that, the magic builds up inside of you and forces you to use it in less than ideal situations. Last night when you finally used your magic, instead of letting it explode meaninglessly, you saw what it could finally do; what you could finally do.”
“You’re saying all of the terrible things I have caused could have been avoided if I had been using my magic all along?” I cringed as I used the word “magic;” as if it were a real thing. “All of this could have been avoided if we would have just had this conversation a long time ago?” I was livid. I thought about the three schools I closed down before Kingsley and winced, knowing it could all have been prevented.
“You’re right, dear,” Aunt Syl rubbed my back gently, in an attempt to soothe my boiling anger. “We had no idea those things would happen though. And we certainly never expected them to keep happening. You see, you are the first of your kind to ever be raised apart. We knew the magic would manifest eventually, we planned to deal with it when the time came. When it did appear however, it was so much stronger then we could ever have anticipated. We weren’t quite sure what to do, and we definitely weren’t sure if it was safe to integrate you into your kind. Finally we made the decision to send you to Kingsley, but it was a last resort, and even then you were in such strong denial. Magic was happening all around you, people were constantly reading your thoughts and you still refused to see the truth about who you are. We were not sure how to approach the subject.”
“Why would you talk to me at all, when you could just send a group of dangerous men to try to kill me? I understood that message loud and clear!” I said sarcastically. I knew that I should be asking other questions, more important questions, more realistic questions, but I couldn’t get over the fact that all of this time I could have avoided destroying everything I touched.
“Please don’t be angry Eden; we had no idea that would happen,” Aunt Syl looked as if she was going to cry and I instantly regretted my outburst.
“She’s right, child,” Principal Saint glanced at the doorway and then back at me. “I don’t believe those men ever meant you harm. And I would never have let you go on that trip had I known that you would be involved. We assume that they were after Kiran and Kiran alone; you, unfortunately for your attackers, were there to teach them a lesson.” He half grunted a laugh and gave me a wink. “Eden, in my wildest dreams, I never imagined your magic would manifest so powerfully. At this point I am unsure what you are even capable of; but I do know that you are very, very powerful. It is time that you learned how to use your magic, not just for your sake, but for Kingsley’s sake as well,” his grin had turned a bit mischievous.
“So what am I then, some sort of Witch?” I asked, still not losing my sarcastic edge, but softening my tone a little.
“Yes, I think that you are a Witch,” I almost laughed, but realized that Principal Saint was completely serious. “Moreover though, you are an Immortal,” he said the word with a deep reverence, and I knew instantly, that this word…. “Immortal” meant something greater than I could comprehend.
“Immortal?” I asked in a whispered breath.
“Yes, an Immortal. We are your people, you’re kind. You are not human as you have been raised, you are an Immortal,” every time he said the word an electric pulse surged through my veins and I was struck with the same reverence that Principal Saint spoke with.
“So I am a Witch that lives forever?” a small part of me began to believe him.
“Well, the real sense of the word Immortal was taken from us a long time ago, but yes, you possess the attributes in which describe a Witch. The way you are able to control or create events and circumstances with your thoughts, the powers that you possess, all point to Witch-like attributes. Or as our people call your kind: the Lamia. It is just another term for Witch though,” he gave me a genial smile. I found myself slightly out of breath, my head spinning. I could hardly understand his words, but the harder part to understand was that I actually did believe him.
“The term Immortal today, really describes a set of four distinct super-human races,” Principal Saint continued. “Immortal is a way of life set apart from ordinary human life. We have our own justice system, our own Monarchy, our own schools and our own belief system. You are a part of us, as much as we are a part of you. As a Witch you occupy a specific purpose for our people and it is important that you investigate who you are and what you are capable of. It is also important that you no longer identify yourself as a human, but learn our laws, and standards. I believe if you do, you will finally come to terms with who you are. You will finally find your destiny,” something stirred inside of me and the electricity or magic or whatever began to rush through my veins. For the first time in my entire life I realized that I had just been told the truth.


Chapter Eighteen


“So last night was, um, normal for someone like me? I mean someone like us? I mean um…. an Immortal?” I got confused saying the word out loud. Principal Saint had basically just relayed the impossible to me. If what he said was true, then I was not human, or like he explained I was more than human, I was a Witch, or what he called an “Immortal.” The enormity of what that meant began to sink in as my blood pumped charged and furiously throughout my body.
“Yes, well kind of. The extra energy or electricity as you call it you feel in your blood and unexplainable phenomena that you seem to be responsible for are parts of what it means to be an Immortal. When you move something just by thinking about it, or create something from nothing, these are all part of your….. powers. Each Immortal is different and unique. We usually classify ourselves into four different categories, but your powers manifested a little stronger than what should be normal for someone your age, someone who did not even know what she was capable of.”
I was trying to take what Principal Saint said as truth, but it was difficult. Everything I held to be true about my life, about me, about the world in general was not true. I was something different; something I assumed only existed in comic books and action movies. My mind was having trouble wrapping itself around the enormity of Principal Saint’s story; yet at the same time my inner being seemed to believe him without any hesitation. I had a thousand questions that needed to be answered.
“How many Immortals are there? What else can I do? Does this mean I’ll never die? Does this mean I’ll never age? Why are my powers so strong? Can I fly?” he cut me off with his hand and a small chuckle.
“No, you can’t fly. Well, at least I don’t think so,” his eyes twinkled, he was relieved to have gotten passed my anger. His smile softened his face and I saw him in a different light now, almost paternal. “Let’s see, there are thousands of us, living all over the world. There used to be more, maybe millions, we equaled the humans, but over time we have begun to die out,” his expression was suddenly full of sadness. “And you can die, eventually, and you will age. ‘Immortal’ was a term given to us a long, long time ago,” his smile had completely disappeared and he suddenly seemed older… ancient. “Thousands of years ago we did live forever, or at least it seemed as if we would live forever. We outnumbered the humans, although we lived in peace with them. No one knows exactly how we came to be, we were born into this world like everyone else, but we simply did not die. Our people would reach an age of maturity and we would age no longer; and we bore children that were like us, Immortals like ourselves. But eventually we began to die like humans, although our lifespan is considerably longer and we have been able to hang on to our special attributes,” I took each word in, feeling as though my head would soon explode. “I’m sorry to go over this so quickly but we don’t have much time.”
“Oh,” is all I said, my brain was on overload.
“We of course keep ourselves a secret from humans now that so few remain; they would have a hard time accepting us,” he smiled at Aunt Syl, who didn’t seem offended.
“But obviously Aunt Syl knew. So why didn’t I?”  
“Well, your parents were gone and I thought this would be the best way for you to…. live,” Principal Saint folded his hands together and looked at me seriously. I realized that he didn’t actually give me an answer, and I had a suspicion that he was hiding something from me, but there was so much information to take in that for the moment his answer was sufficient.
“So I am a Witch? Is everyone at Kingsley a Witch as well?”
“Yes and no, you are a Witch,” he chuckled slightly, “But not everyone is a Witch. There are four distinct types of our kind. All four display very unique qualities and have been given different names; it is much like the different ethnic races in human kind. We are different, but of the same species. At first we did not have names for each other, but over time we have adapted names from the slang that has been associated with us; the names also help us distinguish between ourselves. Recently they have meant the difference between life and death,” he smiled sadly again, “There are the Lamia, or Witches in today’s terminology, the Mediums or Psychics, there are the Transmogrifiers or Shape-Shifters and then there are the Proeliators, they have been called anything from gods, to angels to super-heroes; usually we refer to them in English as Titans.”
“But everyone can refer to themselves as an Immortal?”
“Yes of course, just like any of the different races of humanity are still referred to as humans; what makes us stand apart, but also stand together is the magic that we have in our blood. The tingling sensation or what I think you refer to as ‘electricity,’ that is your magic. You would be unable to function without it; it is your life blood. It defines who you are, I squirmed thinking about the men I supposedly drained of their magic. I may not have killed them, but it sounded like I had given them a fate worse than death.  
“How did you know I call it electricity?” I asked, realizing I had always been very careful to never share that with anyone before.
“One of the special skills of our Psychics is mind reading,” he smiled, and my face flared up from embarrassment. Slowly I remembered every time I felt my question was answered without asking it, from teachers and other students to Kiran. I buried my head in my hands; this had to be a teenager’s worst nightmare come true.
“Don’t worry; we can fix that for you. I can teach you the skills you need to protect your mind against others.”
“So everyone at school has been able to read my mind…. know what I’m thinking?” I whispered the question, completely mortified.
“Well only the Psychics and I suppose, only those who were interested,” he acted so nonchalant I had a hard time believing he grasped the trauma associated with a sixteen year old girl’s private thoughts.
“Kiran?” I asked in an even softer whisper. I could feel my aunt smiling beside me.
“Yes, I’m sure Kiran has been able to listen to your thoughts. Prince Kiran is very gifted; it was probably no challenge at all,” he spoke so matter-of-factly, while my stomach took the roller coaster ride of its life. I felt overwhelmingly nauseous.
“What? Prince? What?” I barely got the words out. Did he say Prince Kiran?
“Yes of course. Kiran Kendrick is our Crown Prince. I told you earlier we have our own Monarchy. His father Lucan rules over us; he is our King and Kiran is the Crown Prince. Please remember, we are not bound by human law,” he reminded me. Excuse me, but up until twenty minutes ago that was the only law I knew existed.
 “So the King is like my King too? I mean I like should respect him and bow and all that?” I laughed; it all seemed too medieval for me.
“Well yes, you’re supposed to, but I don’t think you’ve respected royalty as of this far, so I wouldn’t be too concerned just yet,” Now it was Principal Saint’s turn to laugh.
“They won’t like execute me or put me in prison or anything for that will they? You’ll explain to them that I didn’t know, won’t you?” my hands flew to my throat and I held onto it as if it were about to be chopped off. All of the times I was sarcastic and rude to Kiran flooded my memory…. oops.
“No, don’t be so dramatic,” he chided. “The royal family hasn’t put anyone to death in a long time, or at least a couple years,” his eyes looked out of my window and slightly glazed over. I knew he was thinking about something else, but I was too afraid to ask what it was and apparently lacked the skill to read minds, like the rest of Immortals. “No, you’re not in trouble, but please try to be more respectful in the future. In fact, I think it would be best if you have no more contact with the Prince at all.”
“Why not?” I wondered if that was possible for me. Hadn’t I tried to stay away from him since the beginning?
“Well, he’s really here for only one purpose, and I’m afraid you have been a bit of a distraction. There are other reasons why you should avoid him of course. For one, your friend Lilly is a Transmogrifier attending Kingsley against the law. You see, Shape-Shifters were banished a long time ago. They are the…. lepers of Immortal society, so to speak. Lilly was attending school illegally and hiding her true identity. After last night they have taken her away to await trial. If you were implicated as having known of her true identity, you too would be sent away,” his voice was melancholy and he continued to stare out of the window.
“Lilly is what? What do you mean banished? How can they just take her away? Who took her away? She was trying to protect us! Where is the trial, I’ll go and tell them the truth!” I half stood up, ready to leave at that moment; I couldn’t believe that my one and only friend was gone, for reasons I couldn’t even comprehend. How could someone really be banished? Where did they go? What happened to them if they were caught? My throat tightened with anticipation and I mentally willed my nerves to steady.
“Please, Eden, calm down. Lilly is a Shape-Shifter; the Monarchy banished her kind a long time ago. They are the outcasts of our society. They are to have no contact with the Immortal world,” I watched the pain flicker in his eyes and instantly realized that he did not agree with the edict. “And no, you will do no such thing; the trial will be held in Romania as well, in front of the royal family. If you were to testify on her behalf and she was found guilty you would receive the same punishment as her. We cannot afford that mistake.”
“So those men that attacked us, who were they really after?” I changed the subject, knowing it was a battle that I would not win, at least not then. I decided to think about it later, when I was alone. But the thought that Lilly would be tried the same as those disgusting men who tried to kill her made me physically sick.
“It appears they were after the Crown Prince. They were apparently making an attempt on his life and had assumed he would be alone, with only his body guard. I’m afraid you girls took them quite by surprise.”
“His body guard?”
“Yes, of course. Talbott Angelo is Kiran’s personal body guard. He is a Titan; they are the royal family’s personal guard and personal advisors.”
“Of course he is,” A light bulb went on in my head, and I finally understood Kiran and Talbott’s weird friendship…. or relationship…. or whatever.
“Talbott and a handful of others are the only Titans that have been allowed to leave the King in a very long time. They had hoped it would be enough to protect the Prince; I think they were quite surprised when it was you who saved them all,” Principal Saint chuckled softly. “Talbott is the only one young enough to go to school with you.  The rest of Kiran’s guard try to remain undetected, and unfortunately were completely absent during yesterday’s attack. Luckily for them it was by the Prince’s orders.”  
“Stop calling him that. He’s not like real royalty is he? It’s like I don’t know….”  I tried to search for the right word…. pretend, make-believe, fairytale? Kiran was the Crown Prince of what was now the world that I lived in. How was that even possible?    
“I’m afraid my dear, that the Immortal Monarchy is as real as it gets. They have been a ruling Monarchy longer than any institution in history. And as immature as Prince Kiran is, he has the power over your life and death,” Principal Saint’s expression had turned grave, and I knew that he was serious. But I couldn’t be. Prince Kiran…. what a joke.
“So what, I have to bow, and curtsy…. call him your Majesty?” I couldn’t hold back my sarcasm.
“I’m afraid the best course of action is for you to avoid him completely. He is here, like I said before, for a very specific purpose and you are only getting in the way. If you don’t leave him alone soon, his father is going to have something to say about it,” I blushed defensively. Wasn’t he the one always bothering me? Besides I didn’t see how I was getting in the way of anything. Moreover, I wasn’t sure if I wanted him to stop bothering me....
“Principal Saint, did you know my parents?” I nearly whispered, trying to change the subject, but almost afraid to hear the answer.
“Hmmm….” he smiled softly, “Please call me Amory outside of school grounds.  Yes, yes I did know your parents. A long time ago, I knew them.” He looked up at me and an expression I couldn’t define settled on his face. “You look so much like your mother, Eden,” he continued to stare at me for several moments longer and I began to feel a little uncomfortable. “Now, let’s work a little on your powers alright? Let’s make sure no one can read your mind again.”
I nodded my reply. I had no idea what it meant to “work on my powers,” and I was not completely sure I wanted to know. I felt completely overwhelmed by everything and I wasn’t sure if I could take anymore. The electricity pulsating through my veins would suggest otherwise however and I felt almost itchy to exercise the supernatural force that was, as Principal Saint said before, my Life Blood.


Chapter Nineteen


“Try it again,” Principal Saint…. Amory commanded me.
I closed my eyes, letting in every sound, every movement, and every breath. The magic flowed through me, putting every nerve on edge. My senses were sharpened like I didn’t think was possible and my breathing even.
My blood felt hot under my skin, as if it was boiling my insides, but it wasn’t an unpleasant feeling. I welcomed the sensation, understanding it was the magic finally unleashed. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up straight and I could feel the magic wanting to escape, wanting to be set free.
Now that my senses were heightened, I felt the extra sense that came with being an Immortal. My sixth sense was the perception of nearby magic. What felt like electricity rushing through me whenever I was around another Immortal, was my perception of someone else's magic. When I was near another Immortal’s magic my blood began to tingle and pulsate. The magic that consumed me now alerted me to not only Amory’s presence but that he was at this moment trying to read my thoughts.
I closed my eyes tighter and concentrated. I could not clear my mind, because then I would lose focus. I allowed it to be full of everything I could think of in order to practice for day to day activities. Closing my mind to outside forces must be natural to me or I would never survive another day at Kingsley. A small blush rushed to my cheeks as I thought about all of the days before and how open my mind had been to everyone else.
I allowed the magic to build inside of me, feeling as natural as breathing. Now that I knew the magic was a natural part of me I no longer felt the need to oppress it. I finally understood that when I would push it down before I would only make things more difficult for myself; I was not human, I could no longer act like it.
I felt Amory’s magic prying the outside of my mind. It was as if someone was trying to cover my head with a heavy blanket. Slowly he worked his magic around my mind, trying to slip under or through any way that he could; but the longer I kept him away the easier it became. My magic grew stronger and I stood up straighter. The force field I had built around my thoughts became fortified and I relaxed, this was becoming natural.
I glanced at the clock, careful to maintain my defenses, 3:OO AM. We had been working on this for hours and finally I was getting the hang of it. I felt Amory pull his magic back and I looked over to see that he was finally wearing a smile. After hours of disappointment I was thankful I could finally come through.
“Good Eden. That was excellent!” he clasped his hands together. “Do you think you can keep that up at school?” his smile faded and his expression became worried.
“Yes, I think so. It’s getting easier,” I smiled reassuringly.
“I would not risk it if I didn’t think your absence would cause suspicion. Everyone is going to be asking questions and we can’t afford one mistake. It’s bad enough your only friend at school was a Shape-Shifter, but then to display your powers in such a way as to make the Crown Prince look weak is an entirely different matter,” he wrung his clasped hands together and began to pace. I didn’t exactly understand what he was talking about, but I did trust him.
I watched him silently, realizing how similar we looked. He had the same oversized onyx eyes that I did and a tall frame topped with almost black, wavy hair. I went over the story he told me once again in my mind: my parents died when I was a baby and Aunt Syl found me while she was on a hike in the woods; I had been raised as a human until now when by accident I discovered I had powers. As vague as the story was and maybe a little farfetched, it was the only one I had.
“There is one more thing I would like to try with you. It will require your full concentration, and it will not be easy,” Amory stopped pacing and looked at me full in the face.
“It can’t wait? I’m exhausted,” I yawned in reply and sat down lazily on the edge of my full-sized bed.
“No it cannot,” Amory snapped. “Do you realize what is at stake here? There is no time for sleep; you must master your magic as quickly as possible. Now stand up and focus.”
I obeyed, feeling a little like a zombie. I stood to my feet, the magic moving with me. It was almost as if I could feel my very blood circulating throughout my body. The magic moved with it, pumping from my toes to my heart to my head and back down.
“Now build your shield again,” Amory continued. I threw my force-field around my mind and realized how easy it was becoming. “I want you to hold on to your own mind-defense while trying to read mine. Let your magic leave you slowly searching for my thoughts. Concentrate on me, on being me, on what you want to know,” he stood still, focusing on a framed picture of Aunt Syl. I realized that he had built his defense and was waiting.
"I thought only Psychics could read minds? Aren't I a Witch?" It was late. I was tired. I felt like I couldn't keep my thoughts together.
"Yes, you are a Witch, but after what happened last night, I just want to see exactly what you are capable of. There have been Witches in the past that have been able to read minds and I would like to see if you are one of them," Principal Saint explained. I was too tired to argue.
I did as he said, thinking first of my magic, bringing it into my mind and creating a heady feeling. I swayed slightly, feeling a tad bit drunk, and tried to refocus. I concentrated on Amory moving my invisible and silent magic to the place where I imagined his mind to be.  
I closed my eyes and focused harder. Suddenly it was as if my magic ran into a brick wall. With my mind, I moved it from side to side and up and down. I at least had found his mind; not that that was hard, a mind was where most people imagined it to be: in the head. I worked to penetrate it, to slide underneath his defenses but nothing seemed to work.
I formed the information I wanted to know as a single strain of thought, sending it through my invisible stream of magic using it as extra force against the wall Amory had created. I probed and probed, finding myself tiring from the exertion.
“Don’t give up now Eden, work harder,” he commanded, and I realized why he was the principal of a high school. Yikes.
Again, I did as he said. I stood up straighter, focusing my body as well as my mind. There had to be a loophole here. If there was a way to pierce his force-field it wasn’t going to be from straight on. I continued to search what felt like a square energy field. I moved my magic, like fingers brushing themselves over a smooth surface, until I finally found it; a small, but real opening where his energy field met at a corner.
The hole was tiny, almost miniscule and I was not surprised I had brushed over it so many times before. As I was investigating the catch, Amory realized what I had found. Quicker than I could react, it was gone.
I searched again, with renewed vitality. Now that I knew what I was looking for, I began to find more and more of them. They felt like little rips in my magic, almost like getting a small splinter caught in smooth silk. The more I searched for them, the clearer they became, but whenever I went back to one Amory had already covered it.
I realized I must give up thinking and let my magic take control. I blanketed his mind with my magic, allowing it to completely envelope. This took more energy than I thought it would and I found myself out of breath.
From what I could sense, there were three separate, small openings, but if I hesitated they would be gone. All at once I let my magic infiltrate them, forcing my way into his mind and revealing all of his thoughts. As quickly as I could, I searched for the one thought I wanted to know most: what my mother and father looked like. I flicked through his mind like a flip-file, searching through all of his past memories.
Being in someone else’s mind was almost overwhelming; it was like I had become him. His thoughts and my thoughts were one and the same. I kept my mind protected, but his was completely revealed. I found myself embarrassed as I not only thought his thoughts but felt his emotions. I refused to stop however, until I found what I was looking for.
I searched and searched, realizing that although I had surpassed his force-field, he was still capable of hiding things from me. Suddenly I saw a small glimmer of what I wanted, a long dark haired woman. The image was ripped away from me before I could make it out clearly and my searching became a game of tag.
The minute I found the image I was looking for, another menial image was thrown up in its place. I got tired of fishing trips and old books; I was almost hungry for the image of my mother. I flipped through his memories quicker and quicker, as if I was watching his entire life on fast forward. I felt him growing weaker.
And as he grew weaker, so did I, until I nearly collapsed. A deep longing sensation welled up within me and I couldn’t tell if it was from Amory or if it was from me. I remembered who I was searching for and began again with new vigor.
Suddenly they were before me: my mother and my father. Although nothing had been said out loud, the very fibers of my being told me who they were. My mother was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. She was strongly built, but had a tiny frame. Her eyes were the same eyes that I had, deep coals that were almost too big for her perfect, porcelain face. Plump, bright red lips were turned into a smile as she looked at my father with overwhelming affection. Her dark hair fell in long waves down to her waist and covered her pale figure, making the memory appear to be in black and white.
I tore my thoughts away from my mother to look at my father who was looking back at her with such a loving expression that I began to cry. He was tall and strong; his very being defined the word “Immortal.” He too had dark hair, but it was much curlier and cropped close to his head. His skin was darker than my mother's; it had the same olive tone that Talbott had. His lips were pronounced on his face, but stretched in the form of a smile. A long, angular nose sat underneath the greenest eyes I had ever seen. As he gazed at my mother they glimmered like emeralds.
I examined the scene they were in; they stood gazing at each other in the middle of a crowded room. My mother was placed next to a man at first I assumed to be Kiran; the same dirty blonde hair and piercing blue eyes. But on longer examination I realized that he was older, taller and meaner looking. The man wore an embellished gold crown upon his head and draped his arm around my mother protectively. My father stood on the other side of him, tense as if ready to attack at any moment. Although the blonde man was speaking, my mother and father stared intently at each other as if he did not exist at all.
Suddenly I was ripped away from them. I reached out with my hands as if I could grab on to that memory and hold it close to me. After it was gone I felt lost; I fell to my bed sobbing. The strength I used to enter Amory’s mind was gone and I felt weak and somehow exposed.
“Very good, Eden,” Amory whispered in a hoarse voice. I heard the emotion in his voice, and I wanted to apologize, but all I could do was sob.
The parents I never knew I had, the parents I never thought about were suddenly in front of me. Every molecule I was made of hurt from the exertion of so much power; every emotion in my soul completely exhausted. I unexpectedly felt such a longing for something I had never known, I did not know if I would ever recover.
“It’s normal to feel this way. You accomplished something just now that only the most skilled of us all could hope to do.” I looked up at him, tears streaming down my face, in confusion. “What you did just now is called Complete-Mind-Manipulation. I did not ask you to do that. I asked you to read my thoughts. That is much simpler and requires not near the effort. Reading peoples thoughts is more like reading a newspaper headline, you literally read their thoughts with your magic; there are no images involved. I will not ask you to try it right now, but tomorrow at school I think you should practice on some of your classmates. Reading thoughts does not make the other person aware of what you are doing, most people are sending out their thoughts in one way or another, you are simply catching them. What you did was entering my mind and becoming united with it. You were able to not only know what I was thinking, but what I have ever thought. You saw everything I have ever seen and felt every emotion I have ever felt. This is a very invasive process and rarely accomplished without the permission of the other person. Everything that you feel now, is multiplied by a hundred in me. Most Immortals find it difficult to recover from the process; but thankfully for us tonight I have undergone this process before,” his voice cracked and I realized how weak he suddenly was. Amory was slumped over in his chair, resting his head in his hands, staring down at the floor.
“I am so sorry,” I blurted out, bursting into more tears.
“It’s not your fault; I should have explained more of what you were looking for. I just never assumed you had that kind of power,” he shook his head, and stood up unsteadily. “I will leave you for tonight, please remember everything you have learned today and use it tomorrow. Well everything except…. this,” he walked slowly, shakily to the door and closed it behind him. I had nothing left and could no longer control my emotions; I laid my head down into my pillow and let out everything I never knew I felt.


Chapter Twenty


I arrived at school the next morning to another full parking lot. Magic under control, Aunt Syl had given me my freedom back. Thank God. I couldn’t say that I blamed her; waiting for me to figure out I was superhuman had its disadvantages. But no more blowing things up on accident, now I could do it on purpose.
I parked my car in the last remaining spot and paused a moment to take a deep breath and check myself. My mind was protected and my magic flowing through me naturally; well at least what I had been told was natural. It seemed as if I’d known this secret my whole life, but in actuality it had only been about twenty four hours; I guess I wasn’t really an expert.
I made it to class on time, excited to see Lilly and have someone my age to talk to about this crazy new life. Instant disappointment met me however when I opened the door and realized she wasn’t there. Although Principal Saint or Amory or whoever told me she wouldn’t be, I still had held out hope. The hardest part about learning your true identity is coming to terms with the very real legal system you never knew existed.
I found it ironic how easy it was for me to believe the whole super-human, magic skills thing; but how hard it was to take the Monarchy, governing council, rules and regulations part seriously. Maybe because I’d never personally experienced a ruling class in action it seemed more fiction than reality. I wondered if I had some interaction with the Monarchy if it would feel real or not.
And then I remembered that I had. I walked into class and quickly made it to my seat before the bell rang. Kiran sat to my left in all of his pomp and circumstance. I understood now why the girls fawned over him; it was the idea of a crown…. and maybe his amazing good looks. But I wasn’t falling for it. At least that’s what I kept telling myself.
“Well, well, well…. look who it is,” he whispered snidely as I sifted through my book bag looking for my copy of Romeo and Juliet. A fleeting memory of Principal Saint telling me to leave Kiran alone crossed my mind before I just as quickly dismissed it.
“Hello, your Highness,” I responded sarcastically. He may have been the Crown Prince, but he was still a jackass.
“Finally, you’ve caught up with the rest of us. Congratulations,” he clapped his hands quietly in mock applause. I gave him a sharp look and found the constant smirk he wore already in place.
“Well, we can’t all have parents who are um, alive,” I sighed, still trying sarcasm, but regretting the words as quickly as I had spoken them.
“I guess not,” his tone softened and I thought for a second I made him feel bad. “It’s a pity though; I had so much fun watching you struggle,” Cue the smirk. “Thanks for the other night,” he whispered even softer and I heard real emotion in his voice, I turned to say something to him but found that I was speechless looking into his eyes.
The door to the classroom opened and then slammed. In walked Mr. Lambert and another teenager whom I had never seen before. The sight of Mr. Lambert usually made me feel uneasy and nervous, always like I was about to be yelled at; but today when he walked in, an overwhelming feeling of serenity passed over me. Not only that, but I felt more focused than usual; my senses became heightened and the magic became more alive in my blood. The feeling reminded me of the other night in the woods, sending a shiver down my back.
“Excuse me,” Mr. Lambert cleared his throat in an attempt to draw the attention of the class forward. He tried again a little louder. “Class, please give me your attention; this is Avalon St. Andrews. He is a transfer student from Brazil, please welcome him to Kingsley.”
Mr. Lambert directed him to Lilly’s seat and my heart dropped into my stomach. As the new student sat down, I realized the very real possibility that she might never be coming back. I watched Talbott for a moment and though his expression was frozen in place I imagined I could see the sadness in his eyes.
I turned my attention back over to Avalon St. Andrews, thankful that I was no longer the newest kid in school. By the looks of things however, he was going to have a lot easier time fitting in than I did. He was almost too big to be a high school student; although he was wearing the same white collared shirt and navy blue tie every other boy was wearing, the muscles in his arms were clearly defined through the light cotton. His dark curly hair was long, maybe to his shoulders, but he had it tied in a messy pony tail, giving him the appearance of a biker or something. His nose was pronounced and vaguely familiar, although I couldn’t place it. And his eyes were clear green and penetrating.
His most interesting feature was almost invisible, but my eyes drifted there immediately. Under his hairline, covering the entirety of the back of his neck and clearly marked was a very intricate and elaborate tattoo. What looked like angel wings were spread wide covering all of the skin between the base of his shirt collar and hairline. Complex, but beautiful feathers fanned out into wings I imagined belonging to the angel of death. A symbol sat in the middle of the two adjoining wings, but the way his hair was positioned made it impossible to identify. I glanced down at the rest of his body, expecting leather pants or spurs or something and noticed that underneath his white cotton button down were more lines of the green tattoo ink. Although I couldn’t make out what they were in the shape of, they clearly covered his torso and forearms. He reminded me of someone and I continued to stare at him, wondering who it could be.
“Ms. Matthews…. Ms. Matthews,” Mr. Lambert called loudly from the front of the room. I looked up to see that while I was staring at the new kid, the entire class had turned to stare at me. My face blushed red and I cleared my throat instinctively.
“Ms. Matthews, now that I have your attention, please read the part of Juliet,” I silently came to the conclusion I would never cease to disappoint Mr. Lambert.

----

The lunch room seemed a much more daunting place without Lilly. I grabbed a tray of food and headed to the back of the cafeteria. I was a little bit earlier than everyone else today since I did not stay after class to crowd around Kiran with the other girls and make sure he was Ok after his near death experience on the camping trip. I also refused to throw myself at…. I mean introduce myself to the new kid.
I sat down to an empty table and relished the few moments of silence I had. Now that I was not threatened with the possibility of losing all control, I had been able to observe my surroundings today. All throughout the day I noticed students and teachers using magic.
In small ways and in big ways they used it for everything they did. Students used magic to pick up a pencil off of the floor, and teachers used it to close a door that was left open. Mrs. Woodsen used magic to close the windows in her classroom and then again to open them when I was pretty sure she had a hot flash. Kiran used magic constantly; to write, to open books, to get a drink. At first I thought everyone was just lazy, but after a while I began to realize that the magic was so much a part of them that there was no other way they were able to function. It truly was the essence of their very existence, and I supposed mine too.
A small portion of me was jealous. I had to remind myself that the magic was at my disposal too and then I had to remind myself that I needed to use it. When I didn’t use the magic that was when I began to have problems. And although I knew I was just like everybody else, they apparently hadn’t gotten the memo because I was still a social pariah. Not that I really minded; I couldn’t really imagine that a girl like Seraphina Van Curen and me would ever be friends.
Speak of the devil, Seraphina entered the cafeteria on Kiran’s arm and suddenly the granola bar I’d just taken a bite of was threatening to resurface. I saw that now too, not just the magic but the respect and reverence Kiran demanded. His very presence elicited sycophantic behavior from everyone, both student and teacher. I also noticed how protective Talbott was, but in a more natural, body guard way; he never left Kiran’s side. I saw him always on the defensive, and after last Saturday night I could hardly blame him. Kiran looked my way and I quickly bit into my granola bar again, staring down at the table. I rechecked my mental force-field and found all intact. I breathed an audible sigh of relief, but it appeared premature. A uniformed boy plopped down across from me. I refused to look up from my lunch.
“Go away. Your minions are waiting for you,” I said through bites of an apple.
“Oh, I’m sorry. Was this seat taken?” a polite and surprised deep voice sans cocky English accent asked. I looked up quickly, horrified.
“Oh, no! I am so sorry!” my face turned a shade of crimson red. “I thought you were somebody else,” my hand flew to cover my mouth after I spit apple all over the table and all over Avalon St. Andrews.
“It’s alright. No worries,” he laughed, while wiping a bit of apple off his cheek. How terrible.
He gave me a genuine smile that I returned immediately. The same peaceful feeling from earlier filled my entire body and my senses were once again sharpened. I could hear every conversation, every fork touch the plate, and every small chewing sound in the cafeteria. I did my best to drown it out; it was actually kind of gross.
“You don’t have an accent,” I said bluntly.
“Were you expecting one?” his skin was tan, tanner than most of the students here. His sleeves were rolled up and I could see a deep shade of olive glistened beneath the green lines from his tattoos; it had to be from living in Brazil.
“Oh, I just thought, since you transferred. I’m sorry, I just expected an accent,” I blushed again, not really sure why I felt embarrassed.
“I’m American, just like you,” he smiled as if he had made a joke, but if he had I didn’t get it. “My parents were working in Brazil until last week. We only lived down there for the last two years.”
“That’s nice. Accents can be so irritating anyways,” he looked up at me confused, but I didn’t dare explain.  
“Do you mind if I sit here?” he asked.
“Oh, no, not at all. As long as you don’t mind the outcast table,” I gave him a sardonic grin.
“I don’t mind; I’m pretty sure I prefer it,” he glanced over his should at Kiran and all of his fans; he shook his head and took a big bite of his turkey sandwich. I was pretty sure Avalon St. Andrews and I were going to get along just fine.
“Me too,” I rolled my eyes in the general direction of the Monarchy.
“I’m Avalon by the way. And you’re Eden?” when I nodded my head, he continued, “So I heard a rumor that you like saved his life this weekend?” he jerked his head in Kiran’s direction.
“Where did you hear that?” I asked mortified.
“All of the girls were talking about it this morning. You’d think they’d be grateful, I mean they still have their precious Prince to worship,” he grunted in disgust.
“You’d think,” I agreed with another mouthful of apple. I realized how disgusting my eating habits were around Avalon and I quickly swallowed. The bite was a little too big and I began to choke a little. The apple stayed lodged in my throat as I continued to cough and gulp my bottle of water.
“Use your magic,” Avalon suggested, sounding confused.
Oh right. I held up my finger to him and focused on my magic. The electricity was flowing through my blood at a steady pace. It only took a minimal effort to determine that the apple would no longer be stuck. And just like that I was able to swallow the detrimental piece of food and cough no more.
“Thank you,” I cleared my throat, feeling like an idiot.
“Do you enjoy choking?” I heard the laughter in his voice.
“Ha. Ha. No. It’s just that, well this whole magic thing is new to me,” I gave a sheepish grin and took another swig of my water, just in case.
“What? New to you? How can that be?” Avalon stared at me intently, his green eyes sparkling.
“I was raised by humans,” I explained dramatically. I wiggled my fingers a little, to add a theatrical flair.  
“I’ve never heard of that before,” Avalon sounded skeptical.
“Well, I had never heard of this before.” I gestured to the room filled with my peers, my Immortal peers.
“So you didn’t know about magic? You didn’t know what you were capable of?” He still sounded skeptical.
“Well, I knew I was capable of something. But I just thought I was crazy. I guess I figured it out Saturday night, when people started turning into animals and I could move trees with my mind,” I said it all very casually, but the truth was I still could barely get past what I was able to do.
“Huh,” he grunted. “You mean to tell me, that you were able to save the Prince’s life and do what you did to those Shape-Shifters and you had never even used your magic before?” he squinted his eyes at me, unbelieving.
“I guess,” I looked across the room to where Kiran sat, surrounded. He met my eyes, and I realized that he was watching me. I quickly turned my attention back to Avalon.
“That seems impossible,” Avalon was still skeptical.
“Yeah, to me too,” I looked down at the table, ashamed of what I did and worried for Lilly.
“What are you doing later?” Avalon asked suddenly.
“French homework.” Ugh.
“That seals it. We are going to practice your magic later tonight and that’s final,” he leaned back in his chair and folded his arms across his chest as if his decision was the final authority.
“I told you, I have French homework. It’s going to take me all night,” I protested; although the thought of sitting down to learn a language that completely escaped me made my head spin.
“Eden, there is no more homework. Don’t you get it? You are Immortal! Your magic can do the homework for you,” his voice was stern as if I should have known this forever.
“I can’t cheat!” I protested louder.
“You’re unbelievable. And you have so much to learn. You’re lucky I’m here, you really are. I have so much to teach you!” he gave me a playful smile and I guessed he won, because I couldn’t think of any other reason not to let him help me with my magic.


Chapter Twenty-One


“Do you want to follow me?” Avalon was suddenly behind me as I dug through my backpack looking for my keys.
“Follow you?” I replied confused, pushing my things around inside of my book bag and reaching deeper beyond the books and loose leaf paper.
“We’re going to work on your magic, remember?” Avalon stood next to me, fidgeting a little, as if his muscular frame was having a hard time containing all of the energy within. He rocked back and forth on his heels and bit his thumb nail nervously. I noticed that his right hand was constantly drumming a beat into the side of his Dockers and imagined that he was playing a rhythm to god-knows-what kind of angry rock music I was too innocent to listen to.
I squinted at him, trying to figure him out. The same feeling of peacefulness and tranquility passed over me again and once more I felt completely focused. I had no reason to fidget or wiggle at all. My energy seemed to be completely balanced.
“Magic, Eden,” Avalon nodded his head in the direction of my backpack and heat quickly rose to my cheeks. How could I keep forgetting the magic when it was so helpful in situations like this?
“Oh yea, I forgot,” I finally focused my magic on the missing keys and used it to direct my hand where to go. I pulled them out of my worn book bag, feeling quite triumphant. “Do you want to go to my place?”  
“Just follow me. We have to go somewhere where no one will bother us,” he smiled wide and pointed to his car: a bright red, four door truck, with an extended cab and monster wheels. It not only stood apart from the rest of the black something or others, but stood above them as well. I couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

----

I followed Avalon for twenty minutes. I could tell he wanted to speed, but drove painfully slow so that I could follow him. We drove over the bridge and into Iowa up into the bluffs that looked down over the Missouri River.  
Eventually the road ended and we continued on a dirt path through some trees. I had never been more thankful for my Rover as I bounced along behind Avalon’s ginormous truck.
We continued for miles on a dirt path barely wide enough to accommodate Avalon’s massive vehicle. Every once in a while a tree branch smacked down on the roof of his truck and I fully expected him to eventually get impaled.
After a while Avalon stopped his truck. His was parked precariously near the edge of a one of Iowa’s famous cliffs. I kept my Land Rover a little ways back and in a more secure area. I loved my yellow SUV and was totally not ready to watch it plummet into the Missouri River just yet.
Avalon hopped down from his cab and I noticed that he had changed out of his school uniform. I looked past him to see a winding path that snaked carefully around his truck and into a clearing surrounded by trees on one side and the cliff’s edge on the other. The sight was beautiful, but I couldn’t help the small tremors of terror making their way across my arms and legs. The familiar acceleration of electricity surged through my veins, reminding me that I was a scaredy-cat.
Avalon wore a short sleeved black t-shirt and loose fitting jeans. His hair was out of the pony tail and hung wildly just below chin level. His jet black hair was semi curly, creating the image of chaos carefully framing his prominent two-dimpled grin. My suspicions from earlier were confirmed and I could make out green tattoo ink tracing his forearms up to his biceps and beyond the shirtsleeve.
I shut my engine off and exited my car as well. Still in my school uniform, I felt oddly out of place next to Avalon, who looked like he belonged in a juvenile detention center. A chill ran up my spine reminding me of Saturday night and the last time I was in a wooded area. Images of murderous men flooded my memory and I shook my head to bring myself back to the present.
“What’s with all of the ink?” I jutted my chin at Avalon’s sleeved tattoos, hoping I sounded a little bit cool.
“What, this?” he held up his arms and shrugged. “I guess I like to define exactly who I am.”
“Ok….” I wished I knew what he was talking about.
“Like this,” he pointed to his right forearm and then suddenly took off his shirt. Although I was surprised by his gesture, I finally understood the strange markings on his arm. The entire right side of Avalon’s torso and arm were covered in an intricate and large tree. The tree was amazingly defined and detailed.
The branches of the tree started at his shoulder and wrapped themselves around his arm and to the front and back of his body. The branches and trunk of the tree were thick and gnarled looking. The trunk of the tree wrapped itself from his lower back, around to the right side of his stomach, covering his rock hard abs.
The tree’s branches had no leaves, and were barren, but strong. One branch in particular wrapped its way down Avalon’s arm and to his forearm, breaking off into smaller branches along the way. It was as if someone took a beautiful painting and wrapped it around half of Avalon’s body. The image was powerful and beautiful at the same time.
I walked closer to him, letting my fingers trace the lines running down his forearm. “So what does it mean?” I asked, a little breathless. I had never seen such a vivid tattoo before, although I was not completely sure why it was so powerful to me. Maybe to see such a detailed image on a human body was unusual.
“A tree is the symbol of Eternity, or Immorality. It has been since the beginning of time,” his own fingers traced the lines of the branches.
“Ok, so what is on the back of your neck?” I remembered the first tattoo I saw from that morning.
“Oh that?” he lifted up his hair in the back and revealed the two strong wings I had seen earlier. In the middle of the two wings was a snake wrapped in a circle eating its own tail. The same image of the snake eating his own tail wrapped around his left wrist as well, creating a tattooed bracelet. 
“What does that mean?” I asked, not sure if I was grossed out or in awe again of the detailing that went in to each of his tattoos.
“That literally defines who I am. Someday you will understand,” he spoke cryptically and I wasn’t completely sure I wanted to understand.
“Ok, so this one is pretty self-explanatory,” I pointed to his left forearm; a picture of a beautiful bird rising out of an intricately drawn fire. The bird looked commanding and angry; its wings were spread, but remained close to his body as the tattoo sat long on his skinny, but muscular arm. The one wing reached out across his chest until the image of the tangled tree met it and the other one across his shoulder blade. 
“Is it?” he asked and cocked his head a little to the side.
“No, I guess not. I mean at least I know it’s a bird,” I responded defensively, realizing that I had no idea what the meaning was.
“I’m just giving you a hard time,” he gave my shoulder a rough but playful push. “This is a phoenix,” he pointed to the bird; “It’s just another symbol for Immortality.”
“But we’re not really Immortal, right? I mean we’re not really going to live forever?” I remembered Principal Saint telling me that Immortal was not a literal meaning for our people.
“No, we’ll never live forever as long as Lucan is in charge,” Avalon spat on the ground in disgust. I searched my memory for Lucan and remembered that he was supposedly our King…. my King.
“What do you mean?” I asked innocently.
“As long as Lucan tries to control the magic and keep our people separated, we will never live forever. Our magic isn’t strong enough. But he doesn’t care about us. He only cares about himself, his bloodline and his damn prejudices,” he spat again and I was more confused than ever.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” I tried honesty. Maybe Avalon would give me some explanation.
“The King,” he said, frustrated. When I gave him an even more confused look he continued, “Lucan is the one who has taken away our freedom!” he exclaimed heatedly.
“We’re not free?” I asked in a very small voice.
“No we’re not free, and we’re dying as well. As long as we live under his bondage, we will continue to die. But he could care less. All he cares about is that his blood remains pure, and the blood of his line. The Monarchy must never become tarnished,” I could almost feel Avalon’s disgust as an oppressive force weighing down on me.
“Ok, you need to explain…. now,” I tried to be forceful, hoping that he remembered I was new to this whole thing.
“Sorry,” he grunted, not sounding sorry at all. “Derrick is the King that outlawed intermarriage, well for everyone but his precious line. This happened a long time ago.  Derrick was the first King, the first Immortal to rule our people. The people cried out for a King and they were given one. Too bad the first thing he did was execute the Oracles.”  
	“The who?” I interrupted; trying to stay focused and keep my head from spinning out of control.
“The Oracles, they were something like prophets or advisors to our people before the King. There were four of them and they represented one of each of us, and together they were all powerful. They were also the first to die. So anyway,” he shot me a serious look that let me know not to interrupt again, “After Derrick executed the Oracles, he banished the Shape-Shifters. He claimed they were deceitful and manipulative because they were able to take any form. He turned the other Immortals against them and those who didn’t escape were hunted and thrown into prison until their magic was weak enough that they could be killed. And since the Titans had pledged their allegiance to protect the King before one had ever been elected they were forced into service and remain there today as nothing more than glorified prisoners.” He took a moment to spit on the ground once again. “The only free people are the Witches and Mediums, but I would hardly call what we have freedom. We live under tyrannical rule and a King who is just as heartless and sick as his forefather. And who knows what the next King will be like; he seems even more clueless than those who came before him. Our people are going to die and they do nothing about it.”
“But what could they do about it?” I thought about Kiran and found it hard to believe he would actually want us all to die. He may have been immature, but he was not a ruthless killer.
“They could break the ban on intermarriage for one. They could allow the full magic to flow between us and they could release us from their dictatorship,” the whole Monarchy thing might have been new to me, but I knew enough about world history that if what Avalon just told me was true, then I also knew that what he was saying could probably get him killed.
“What marriage ban?” I asked, feeling more confused than ever.
“The one that got us into this whole mess to begin with. We are not allowed to marry outside of our own kind.”
“You mean, like humans?”
“No, well, yes, but mainly a Witch has to marry a Witch and a Titan has to marry a Titan. They keep us compartmentalized that way, and they restrict the flow of magic. See before King Derrick, an Immortal could marry whomever they chose and no matter who they married their child was always unique. Like a Witch could marry a Titan and then have a Medium for a child. It was all allowed and the magic flowed freely. But since Derrick, our magic is deteriorating and the royal family could care less,” Avalon laughed bitterly.
“But isn’t their magic deteriorating as well? Won’t they eventually have to intermarry?” I asked, feeling like I was beginning to understand the whole thing and realizing the people I was a part of had just as many problems as humans.… if not more.
“They are the royal family. They can marry whomever they choose,” Avalon said slowly as if I were having trouble understanding his words. I didn’t really blame him. “Not that they would marry just whomever, they only choose the best of the best. And for them that means either a Witch or a Psychic. They rotate between generations. Up next is a most promising Psychic, I’m sure.”
“What? So Kiran has to marry a Psychic?” I had a hard time getting the actual word out.
“Yes, that’s the law. Just to ensure the royal blood stays strong. His father of course married a Witch, and now it’s his turn to carry out the imperial edict.”
“Huh….” was all I could say. I knew Avalon had just enlightened me on an overwhelming amount of new information; but the hardest part I found myself unwilling to accept was that by law it was illegal for me to marry Kiran. Not that I would even think that far ahead, or have those kind of feelings for him; but the fact that it was against the law, that I was not even an option, was making me a little resentful.
I thought about Lilly then and realized what she was up against. A wave of fear flooded my entire body and I realized that I had to do something to help her. I shuddered at the thought of the court inevitably finding her guilty. My mind began to reel with the crushing feeling of hopelessness that settled on me. I had to talk to Kiran about it, he had to do something.
“So anyway,” Avalon changed the subject, still sounding riled up from his tangent. “Move that tree.”
“Excuse me?” his command brought me out of my inner freak out.
“Move that tree,” he said it slower, but firmer.
“You’re not very nice you know,” I gave him a playful pout.
“I’m sorry, you’re right. I just don’t like those damn Kendrick’s,” he smiled playfully back. “Please, move that tree.”
I focused my energy on a medium sized tree that sat about twenty feet away from us. I let the electricity surge through my blood and build, using my mind to direct the tree. I lifted it out of the ground slowly; the roots and branches hung limply down on the ground below where it was now suspended in midair, completely unearthed.
“What now?” I faked a yawn, as if holding the tree in midair was the easiest thing in the world.
“Now put it back,” he smiled smugly as the tree wavered a little bit while my mind grasped the task.
Blowing things up and ripping things apart was easy. I had never had to put something back together before. I focused my energy back into the ground. I lowered the tree slowly with my mind until it was positioned just above the earth. I let my mind snake through the roots of the tree, my energy focused completely. I let them dig back into the soil, searching for their homes once again. Slowly and methodically I returned each root and branch to its original position and let the tree rest peacefully, balanced once again deep within the earth. 
“Good,” Avalon admired quietly. “You’re better than I thought you’d be.”
“Well, thank you,” I gave a sarcastic bow, but was actually very thankful for the words of encouragement.
We spent the rest of the afternoon like that. Avalon giving me task after task, each one getting more difficult. I completed all that he assigned me and continued to impress him. I would think that after hours of using my magic I would have felt fatigued or depleted; but instead I felt more empowered. The more I used the magic, the more magic I had to use. I was filled with a never ending supply of omnipotence.


Chapter Twenty-Two


“Pssst…” Avalon tried to get my attention during French, but I did my best to ignore him. “Hey, Eden.” He whispered harshly.
“What?” I whispered as softly as possible, realizing I could never be quiet enough to escape Ms. Devereux’s stern glare.
“What are you doing tonight?” Although Avalon sat directly behind me during the hour of horror known as French, Ms. Devereux had positioned me at the front of the class; always under the watchful eye of the firm French teacher. I had done my best to catch up, but the woman could not understand a world in which French was not spoken fluently in every home. Since I didn’t grow up with parents who spoke multiple languages and summered in the South of France, I thought I had ample excuse to be a bit behind; she saw it differently.
“Nothing. Leave me alone,” I whispered even quieter back.
“Good,” Avalon replied a little louder than I felt comfortable with.
I turned my attention back to my book work and concentrated as hard as I could on my conjugations. I was sure Avalon had some great plan for the evening. Over the past week and a half I learned to just go along with the adventure; which usually meant an isolated area, usually forestry, working on my magic. Avalon was always very concerned that I was practicing what powers I had.
I never complained and always had fun. I enjoyed learning all of the super-human feats I was capable of. But even more I enjoyed spending time with Avalon. He was always amusing and always adventurous. He was like the exact opposite to how careful and easily-scared I was. We complemented each other well.
“Do you own anything sexy?” Avalon whispered hoarsely to me, striking up another in-class conversation.
“What?” I blurted out, too loudly. My cheeks flamed red and I dropped my pencil on the ground.
“Mr. St. Andrews, Ms. Matthews please continue this inappropriate conversation after class. Merci beaucoup,” Ms. Devereux seethed through her strong French accent. I blushed even redder and averted my eyes back to my homework.
As I stared down at the foreign language I could barely understand a small ball of paper landed right in front of me. I expected it to be an apology from Avalon, although I could hear him snickering behind me. I unrolled the wrinkled piece of paper, curious more than anything.
Maybe you should save the dirty talk for private....
I glanced over at Kiran to confirm the sender. He was staring at me with a smaller version of his signature smirk, but something was different about his eyes. I rolled my own eyes at him and gave him my own playful version of a smirk, but he just looked back down at his homework. Instead of feeling irritated like I would have expected, I felt a little bit sad, missing the days when he would have made more sport out of embarrassing me. I realized this sounded twisted, but I was suddenly nervous I had lost his attention.

----

“I’m sorry, Avalon, did you want to ask me something?” I asked Avalon sarcastically, as he sat down at our regular table. “Because I would appreciate it if you asked me your inappropriate questions here, alone; not in the middle of French class where the teacher already hates me and the entire class is listening in,” I pretended to be really upset, but Avalon realized a while ago I was incapable of getting angry with him. He did enjoy trying to make me mad though.
“Oh, calm down,” he shook his head and gave me a wide smile, accentuating his dimpled cheeks. His mischievous baby face contradicted strongly with the rest of his toned physique. “If you would use your magic and let me communicate telepathically with you, I wouldn’t have to say things loud enough for the entire world to hear.”
	“Oh, I see. It’s my fault. You know that I’m not supposed to um, let my guard down,” I said softly, still not sure why Principal Saint had been so insistent upon my mental defenses.
“I know that, I’m just giving you a hard time. Chill out. But what I really need to know is if you have something nice to wear tonight…. something um, more grown up?” Now that he was forced to ask me his bizarre question face to face, I realized that he was a little shy. I inwardly felt satisfied to witness Avalon’s small embarrassment; although it could never equal my seemingly constant humiliation.
“That depends on what you have planned,” I doubted any good could come from whatever scheme he was devising.
“I, of course, can’t tell you,” he replied dramatically. “It’s a surprise,” he looked around us as if to make sure no one was paying attention. “And really, it’s no big deal.”
“Oh but you expect me to get all dressed up?” I asked hoping to get more details.
“Well, it’s just that…..” he hesitated, and looked around again. “Do you have something sexy or not?” he was barely able to say the word now that we were face to face.
“You are awesome at asking a girl out,” I was a little irritated with his funny behavior.
“This is not a date!” Avalon blurted out a little too loudly. My face flooded with heat immediately and I couldn’t look him in the eyes.
“I was just joking.” I mumbled pathetically. I knew that it wasn’t a date from the beginning. It wasn’t like that with Avalon…. but he didn’t have to react so strongly.
“I’m sorry,” Avalon calmed down and said softer, “Eden, I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings. It’s just that, you know, we’re only friends right? I mean good friends… best friends…. but just friends,” I nodded my reply, instantly forgiving him, but I fully planned on milking this just a little longer. “Besides, this is a mission.”
“A mission?” curiosity made me completely forget feeling sorry for myself. “For what?”
“You’ll just have to wait and see,” Avalon responded mysteriously, flashing his big dimples at me again. “Remember, look like a grown up. I’ll pick you up at eight,” he stood up and headed for the door. I was once again left to wonder at the strange behavior of high school boys.

----

I checked myself in the full length mirror once again, not fully buying what I saw. Aunt Syl was working tonight and so I had full access to her “grown-up” wardrobe per request from Avalon. I obeyed his appeal to find something more mature, but left him waiting impatiently in his truck while I found the courage to leave the house.
The dress I chose to wear could have had many descriptions; some might have called it “sexy”… I called it “midnight hooker.” Somehow I thought Avalon would approve. The all black dress was simple, maybe too simple, but definitely mature. The short skirt covered just enough, leaving my legs bare, but looking extra-long. The dress covered nothing behind me above my low hip-line and I prayed it would remain tactful although completely backless; I was thankful that the neckline of the dress was just below my throat. My arms were sleeveless and the only thing keeping the dress on my shoulders was a thin ribbon that tied at the base of my hairline.
I resisted the urge to let my hair hang down covering the open back, and instead pulled it over one shoulder in a loose and low pony tail. I stepped close to the mirror and applied some bubble gum pink lip gloss. Looking over myself for a final time I realized I had forgotten shoes.
I ran back into Aunt Syl’s closet. My eyes quickly assessed the racks of designer heels and fell on a pair of six inch hot pink stilettos. I pulled them on immediately; fully aware I would regret the decision later. I grabbed a silver clutch on my way out of the massive room and went as quickly, but as carefully as possible down the stairs and out the door.
Using magic to lock the house, I made it to Avalon’s truck before I realized there was no way in hell I could make it up into his cab with class. I opened the door of the truck and eyed the step. I looked back down at the long heel on my beautiful shoes and then at my short tight skirt and laughed out loud.
“You have got to be kidding me.” I turned my eyes to Avalon and shook my head. “This is impossible.”
“You’re right,” Avalon turned off the engine and jumped down. “I said look grown up, not like a prostitute,” he hurried across the street to a silver Lexus parked on the curb. “Whose car is this?”
“I think my neighbors. You don’t have to be rude. I can go change,” I called after him; my insecurities confirmed.
“Nah. You’re fine; I was just kidding,” he opened the door of the car easily; I had expected it to be locked. Avalon took another look around and sat down in the driver’s side seat. “Come on.”
I walked over to the car with my mouth open. There was absolutely no way I was stealing this car. I half expected Avalon to rip the wires out of the steering column and do some fancy trick to hotwire it. Of course he just used his magic and turned the car on without any sign of vandalism.
“There is no way I am going to be an accessory to grand theft auto!” I shook my head and crossed my arms stubbornly.
“Come on, we’re going to be late,” Avalon ignored my objections.
“I’m serious, Avalon,” I tried again, but he threw the passenger’s side door open and revved the engine.
“Seriously Eden, we will bring it back completely unharmed. If you like, I’ll even fill up the gas tank. Now get in,” he said it firmly and I realized that he was going with or without me so I decided to get it in. Hopefully my magic would be enough to repair any major damage Avalon was able to incur.
Avalon played with the dial of the radio, until he found something he deemed suitable. The loud music reinforced the point that this was definitely not a date and I realized once again that I was totally fine with that. My interest was raised however, and I couldn’t even imagine where he was taking me.
Avalon drove out of my neighborhood and towards downtown. I lived nearly exactly midtown, in an area called Dundee, so it only took fifteen minutes or so before we were driving on the old brick streets through the Old Market. Shops and restaurants surrounded us on both sides of the old fashioned part of town.  
We drove slowly to avoid the meandering pedestrians and occasional horse and buggy. Cops sat on street corners talking casually with street artists and a group of musicians played the blues with an open guitar case set out in front of them.  
Although the weather was still fairly warm, the days were growing shorter and it was already dark outside. My magic was pulsating and my senses were heightened. I could feel the pull of strong magic in the direction we were driving causing my heart to beat even faster.
Eventually Avalon pulled over in a more deserted area of downtown. My pulse quickened as we stepped out of the car. I could tell where we were going now from the draw of magic beneath the ground, but I let Avalon lead the way.
I followed Avalon to a darkened doorway that appeared to be locked; the door was made out of a strong wood but had been painted black. A brass door knocker sat in the middle shaped into the same image that Avalon had tattooed on his left wrist: a large snake wrapped around an apple, eating its own tail. A chill ran up my spine; I was not entirely sure what I had just gotten myself into.
Avalon gripped the doorknocker in his palm and held it for a few seconds. The brass turned to gold and then illuminated the doorway for only a second before dulling back into the brass we first encountered. I heard the lock click and the door opened partway. I followed Avalon into the building realizing he had given me no explanation as to what was behind this door.
A long and lighted hallway surprised me, as I had expected something dark and dingy. Candelabras on mahogany tables were placed evenly down the length of the hallway; the carpet was plush and burgundy and the wallpaper, a beautiful and intricate gold-leafed. Although the entrance was not what I had expected, it still offered no explanation as to where I was.
“Follow my lead.” Avalon turned his head and whispered to me. “And stay close,” the look in his eyes helped me understand his seriousness. I nodded my head, swallowing the huge lump in my throat and continued down the hallway.
At the end of the passage was a large mahogany door with a similar brass knocker as the first door; only this snake was much skinnier and wrapped around a scroll. Avalon wrapped his hand around it and the same effect as before occurred. This time however, beyond the door was a set of stairs winding downward, but significantly dimmer than the hallway.
I could hear many voices below us and the strong drag of magic left me certain this was our destination. I followed Avalon down a twisting path of stone stairs that seemed like it would never end. My stilettos made a clicking noise with each step.
At the bottom of the stairs was a surprisingly large room full of people. The room must have covered the entire block underneath the streets up above. The people all dressed extremely well, milled around the room on plush couches and chairs covered in ruby and gold thread. Small tables sat in between them and I noticed in one corner of the room larger tables, set up for poker. A counter ran half the length of the back of the room serving drinks and I realized that this place was a bar, or a club, or Ok, I didn’t really know what this place was yet, but something along those lines.
Avalon walked straight over to the long counter and ordered two drinks; I stayed close to his side and took the brown liquid he offered to me. I sipped the strong smelling liquor, pretending I knew what I was doing, but nearly spit it out in the same breath. The strong, woodsy whisky burned as I struggled to swallow it and then gave me an instant heady feeling, making the room spin around me.
“Use your magic,” Avalon whispered to me through gritted teeth. I forced a smile and then worked harder to force my magic into control. I calmed my nerves and cleared my head. I would just pretend to drink whatever it was.
Avalon looked around the room nervously and I wished I knew what he was looking for. I did my best to pretend to be bored; mimicking the stance of the other scantily dressed women I saw standing around the room. Avalon stood on his tippy toes to get a better look and I contemplated telepathic communication to get some answers, but decided against it.
The force of magic radiating around the room and my blood, hot and boiling, combined with the energy buzzing inside of me confirmed my belief that everyone in here was an Immortal. I was at once thrilled that there were so many others like me, but then cautious again when I realized they were still all strangers. They however, all seemed to know one another. Maybe this was some type of Immortal club that I hadn’t been inducted into yet.
“Stay here,” Avalon commanded and turned to walk away.
“Wait,” I demanded. “Where are you going?” I was suddenly nervous and shy.
“I’ll be right back…. I promise,” Avalon softened his tone and gave me a reassuring smile. I tried to trust him, but this whole night had just been too weird.
I attempted to follow Avalon with my eyes, but I quickly lost him in the crowd. For a while I could follow his trail of magic, but the overwhelming quantity of mixed energies in the room made me lose that as well. I looked down into my glass and swirled around the golden liquor, contemplating another sip.
“Well, well, well…. look who it is,” A familiar English accent whispered into my ear with equal parts menace and mischief. “What are you doing here?”
“What do you mean? What are you doing here?” I avoided his question and leaned back against the bar. I took a miniscule drink from my cup, noticing Kiran had an identical one in his hand.
“Hmm…” Kiran’s eyes drifted over my “mature” outfit and heat crept onto my face. “So this is what Avalon had planned for you…. not very exciting.”
“Then why are you here?” I asked again, realizing that although I hadn’t given him an answer, I hoped he would give me one.
“I have to be here; royal duties and all,” he shot me a roguish look and took a long drink from his tumbler. His usually clear blue eyes looked a little duller than usual and I noticed black and blue bags under them.
“Must be tough to be King,” I pretended to take an equally long drink.
“Not King yet,” he said simply. Kiran looked me over once again and I crossed my arms self-consciously. He stepped closer, resting his hands on either side of my body. I could smell the woodsy scent of liquor mixed with his sweet, almost herbal scent and the electricity picked up strength through my veins.
“So really, what are you doing here?” I tried one more time, my voice trembling from Kiran’s close proximity. His hands slid up my arms and he pulled me in closer until our bodies were touching. Electricity almost overpowered my senses and I forgot the rest of the world around us.
“This is where I conduct my business, Eden. You are in my American office,” he smiled a little. I wished I could look around the room once again, but I couldn’t tear my eyes away from Kiran’s. “Oh, Eden you’ve so much to learn,” he smiled a little wider and leaned his face even closer to mine. I was transfixed in his arms, completely unable to move. I was certain he was about to kiss me and I closed my eyes in anticipation. His grip tightened on my arms and I felt the heat from his face; his sweet breath tickling my nose.
And then…. A throat cleared in my ear and my eyes instantly popped open. Kiran's body stiffened next to me and all intentions changed. Principal Saint and Talbott stood there side by side, both sets of arms crossed, both men visibly seething. I gathered myself and regained my senses quicker than I thought possible.


Chapter Twenty-Three


“Damn it,” Kiran growled and slammed his hand against the bar behind me. I jumped, startled by his outburst of anger. He turned to face the interrupters, but did not leave my side. “Can I help you gentlemen?” he asked through gritted teeth.
“Forgive us for the interruption sir, but Ms. Matthews is not allowed in your private club,” Principal Saint ended his sentence with a small bow. His manner was respectful, almost subservient.
Outside of school, the roles were reversed. Kiran was in command here, and Principal Saint must obey Kiran’s orders. I may have had a hard time wrapping my mind around the Monarchy before tonight, but the facts of Kiran’s power were clearly displayed in front of me. I was forced to understand the role of the Monarchy in my life now. My face flushed with embarrassment, as I noticed all eyes in the enormous room focused on us.
“I granted her entrance,” Kiran said softer, noticing the onlookers as well. His voice however, was none the less menacing.
“I’m sorry sir; by your father’s order she is not allowed here,” Talbott interjected himself and I couldn’t help but despise him a little more.
“Mr. St. Andrews is waiting upstairs to take you home,” Principal Saint addressed me for the first time and then angled his body as if to tell me I should leave immediately. I began to move, but Kiran stopped me by putting his hand on my waist.
“There’s no need for that. I was leaving anyways. I will take her home. Please tell Avalon, he is free to go,” Kiran took me by the arm a bit roughly and began walking towards the door.  
“Excuse me, Prince Kiran; there is still business to attend to,” Talbott again interrupted, but this time I could hear the small amount of trepidation in his voice.
“What business?” Kiran growled quietly without even turning to look at him.  
“I am not at liberty to say in front of.... her,” Talbott referenced me with a disdain that let me know exactly how he felt.
“Fine,” Kiran stood still for a few seconds longer, but did not let go of my arm. He left his back turned on Talbott and Principal Saint, apparently trying to decide what to do next. I was too afraid of him to speak. I could feel the heat of his anger swirling around us. The electricity pulsed between my skin and his fingers wildly. “I will walk her to the door,” before anyone else could object, he began walking again, pulling me along beside him.
“I’m sorry,” I stammered out; not exactly sure why I was apologizing.
“Don’t be. You did nothing wrong,” he mumbled through gritted teeth.  
He did not let go of my arm the entire walk upstairs. I hurried along beside him as quickly as I could in the shoes that I was wearing. Kiran rushed up the long flight of stone stairs and through the long, brightly lit hallway. He did not stop moving until we reached the door to the outside.  
If I was surprised by his behavior downstairs, I was even more surprised by his behavior on the way back to the front door. But nothing could have prepared me for what he did next.
Once we reached the door, I grabbed for the handle, hoping to escape to the safety of the car Avalon had stolen. I was perplexed by Kiran’s behavior, but more than anything I was humiliated by my exile from his private club. I wanted to put this night behind me and crawl into a ball, forgetting about this entire experience. Kiran however had a different idea of how to end the night.
Although I reached for the door, Kiran stopped me by grabbing me firmly around my waist. His hands were hot against my skin, even through the material of my dress. He pushed me roughly against the wall and pressed his body against mine. One hand stayed on my hip, but the other he raised above my head to plant firmly against the wall. The magic flared in my blood, making it boil beneath my skin.
Kiran stared into my eyes for several seconds looking for something I was not sure I possessed. The intensity of his expression left me breathless and the closeness of his magic made me dizzy. The electricity ran between us wildly, igniting a lightning storm in my veins.
Suddenly, his lips were against mine, and his hand was tangled in my hair. He kissed me hungrily, pressing me against his body and wrapping me up in his magic. I kissed him back as if I couldn't breathe without him. Every place our bodies touched felt like a thousand degrees; he kissed me passionately, leaving my mouth for only a second to kiss my neck and jawline, but then he was back to my lips with even more passion. I heard him sigh sweetly as though he had waited for this kiss for a very long time. Our magic connected with an almost violent force and I fought to keep consciousness. Our souls were united in that one moment, and I never wanted to leave it.
Kiran’s sigh turned to misery as the door at the end of the hallway slammed shut. Another magical entity was present and our perfect kiss was forced to a close. Kiran was across the hallway in milliseconds. He gave me one more intense look of longing and then turned around to walk in the other direction. I was left staring after him with swollen lips and messy hair.
Principal Saint waited at the end of the hallway for Kiran to approach and respectfully opened the door for him to pass through. The door closed behind him with a loud finality, leaving me to feel cold and alone. Kiran’s magic was no more a part of mine; I felt drained and empty. Although my own magic was still pulsing through my blood at a rapid rate, without Kiran’s to set it on fire, it left me something to want.
Principal Saint stayed on my side of the door as if protecting the entry way from the likes of me. The thought of forcing my way passed him crossed my mind, but the other side of the door offered no hope to reinstate the kiss anyways. I tore through the door to the street instead, running as quickly as I could to the safety and loneliness of Avalon’s stolen Lexus.
I found sanctuary in the passenger’s seat of the sedan. I plopped down on the seat, very unlady-like and completely out of breath. I barely paid attention to Avalon, but out of the corner of my eye I could tell he was equally as emotional as I was.
I touched my fingers to my still swollen lips, expecting Avalon to drive away. Instead of making a getaway however, he rolled down his window and I saw the figure of Principal Saint resting his hands on the open window frame.
“How dare you bring her here,” although Principal Saint didn’t use my name directly, it was crystal clear who he was referring to. His fingers gripped tightly to the window sill. Clearly he was angry, but I was confused why my presence here would conjure such rage.
“Nothing happened,” Avalon defended himself loudly, and accentuated his point by slamming his hands on the steering wheel. His fingers wrapped themselves around the leather and gripped the steering wheel equally as tight as Principal Saint’s. “We’re all fine.”
“Something did happen.” Principal Saint spat back. I realized I preferred a much more docile school teacher, than this angry and scary version of Principal Saint. Everyone was clearly livid with me, but I could not figure out why. Maybe I wasn’t allowed in the club, but were these reactions really necessary? “The entire room noticed who she is because of the Prince’s damn affections for her. Now not only do you risk discovery but the entire Kingdom will soon be aware of her effect on the Prince. Damn it Avalon, what were you thinking?”
“I am stronger with her near me. I can’t just run reconnaissance without some type of protection. You send me into the lion’s den and you expect me to kill the beast, unarmed,” Avalon nearly shouted at Principal Saint; he grasped the steering wheel tighter and glared out the windshield.
“Never mind that now. Get her out of here,” Principal Saint touched the steering wheel underneath Avalon’s firm grip and the car instantly turned on. “Take her straight home; we will talk about this later,” the two of them had yet to address me personally. If only I could stay mad, but the burn of Kiran’s sweet kiss still lingered on my mouth.
Avalon stomped his foot down on the accelerator and my head slammed back against the headrest. He peeled out of the parking space without slowing down. It was my turn to dig my fingers into something and I found the edge of my leather seat and held on tight.
“Damn it. Damn it. Damn it,” Avalon repeated over and over; and then another long stream of expletives poured out of his mouth. I was not sure how to react, but felt strangely responsible for the demise of whatever he had planned tonight. “Why can’t you just stay away from him?” he practically shouted at me.
My temper flared up immediately. “If I remember correctly, you were the one who dragged me along to that place, and you were the one who left me completely alone! Kiran approached me. I did exactly as you said and did not move from the bar. He came over to me. I didn’t even know he was there!” I yelled back, suddenly over emotional and definitely sick and tired of being blamed for Kiran’s actions.
“You cannot talk to him anymore Eden; you have to end whatever there is between you.” Avalon softened his voice, almost pleading with me. 
“There is nothing between us,” I replied just as softly; but my lips burned from the memory of our kiss. I looked out the window and watched the scenery fly by as Avalon drove a hundred miles an hour.
“Do not lie to me,” he said sternly. “Eden, don’t lie to yourself. He is dangerous and.... evil. You have no idea what you are getting yourself into. You cannot be so reckless,” Avalon’s eyes turned hard as he stared at the road ahead of him. I didn’t know how to respond to his allegations; I didn’t know why he hated Kiran so much. But I did know that Kiran was not evil and that he was not dangerous; at the same time an uneasy feeling washed over me and a small pit of fear began to grow in my stomach.
“There is nothing between us, really,” I tried to sound confident, but my voice was tiny and far off.
“Promise me you will not let it get farther than what it is right now. Promise me you will stay away from him,” Avalon turned to face me and the look on his face was enough to make me promise anything. I quickly shook my head “yes” and reached out to grab his hand. His skin was cold and when I touched it the magic easily flowed between us. My senses became even clearer and my magic became instantly stronger, rushing quickly throughout my body.
“He will take that away from you,” Avalon said sadly, and I understood that he was referencing our magic. “You have to trust me Eden.”
“I do,” I said simply, knowing that it was the complete truth. Whatever it was about Avalon, and whatever happened to our magic when we were together, I knew it was no mistake. I trusted him completely, and I knew he would only do what was best for me. I did not know however, if I could keep my promise to him and stay away from Kiran.
The rest of the drive home was made in silence. Avalon’s eyes never softened. I could feel his magic on edge and irritated. I could feel him always searching our perimeter, looking for other signs of magic. I was not sure what he was looking for, but it made me nervous.
Avalon pulled into the same spot on the street that he took the Lexus from what seemed like hours ago. He parked it perfectly and I relaxed a little, realizing he brought it back in excellent condition. We got out of the car, silent still and he walked me to the door.
I expect to say goodbye to him at the doorstep, but when I unlocked the front door and turned around to say goodnight, I realized he was following me inside.
“Where’s Sylvia?” Avalon asked. He began to search the downstairs of my house as if expecting to find an intruder. My throat closed in nervousness, wondering what exactly he was looking for.
“Um, I think she’ll be at the hospital all night,” I noticed that Avalon called my aunt “Sylvia” and I couldn’t remember ever giving him her full name.
“I better stay here tonight. Do you mind?” he didn’t wait for an answer, but walked over to the wicker basket of blankets behind the oversized couch and pulled out a large, warm quilt.
“I guess not,” I debated whether to be annoyed or scared, but in the end I decided I trusted him; and so I walked over to the linen closet and grabbed him a few feather pillows.
“Goodnight, Eden,” Avalon plopped down on the couch and pulled the blanket over him without even taking off his shoes.
“Goodnight, Avalon,” I replied and made my way up the stairs and into the quiet safety of my bedroom. What a night.


Chapter Twenty-Four


“It looks like you’ve made a new best friend,” Kiran’s crisp accent whispered in my ear from behind. He scared me so I turned too quickly to face him and our noses bumped. A shot of electricity rushed through my blood as we were less than millimeters apart from each other. And then I blushed as I remembered our kiss from the other night.
“What do you mean?” I asked, praying my breath had recovered from lunch.
“The new kid, it looks like you two are getting along well,” he sat down next to me at the lab table. Lilly was usually my chemistry partner, but because of her prolonged absence I was alone today.
“Avalon is um, nice,” I was not quite sure what Kiran was getting at; but almost positive he was just trying to extract some reaction from me.
I turned my attention back to my work, not really sure what to do. Both Avalon and Principal Saint had told me countless times to keep my distance from Kiran and I’d done my best, but Kiran hadn’t been given the same directions.
Well, actually he had been told to stay away from me; he just had the luxury of being able to do whatever he wanted. I found that a tiny bit irritating.
“I bet he is,” Kiran grunted and I realized for the first time that Kiran was jealous of Avalon. I couldn’t hold back a smile. I looked over at Avalon who was partnered with Adelaide Meyer, extricating her from her usual table with the “holy trinity”. Despite her separation from Seraphina and Evangeline she seemed completely at ease. Well at least she was completely drooling over Avalon, finding any excuse possible to touch him; my stomach churned violently, but not from jealousy.
More like I had an internal need to protect him. I found this weird, since we just met not that long ago, but the feeling remained despite that fact. I stared at them for a few seconds longer wondering if Avalon enjoyed the attention or was as annoyed with her as I was just watching them. Yuck.
“Have you met him yet?” I asked, half joking. I pretended to focus more intently on the busy work Mr. Hayman assigned, carefully looking up answers from the Table of Elements.
“No, not yet. I mean he did manage to break into my private club and all, but I wouldn’t say that we have met properly. Would you care to introduce us?” his English accent was the epitome of gentlemen-like behavior, but I noticed his eyes roll and shoulders slump a little.
“My pleasure,” I mumbled. I glanced again at Avalon understanding why all of the girls fawned over him, but that didn’t mean I necessarily felt the same way. He had turned into my only friend since Lilly’s absence and we had a lot of fun together, well at least a lot of excitement together. But he was definitely only a friend.
I had tried to like him. I had tried to play his games; but I couldn’t keep up. Besides I was pretty confident he was not the least bit interested in me. We were it seemed, just friends. Actually I didn’t even know if I could say that. He at least preferred to talk with me more than the other girls, but I just couldn’t figure him out.
If I understood Kiran’s feelings for me, or non-feelings for me, maybe I could have understood his jealousy, but at the moment it didn’t make any sense. Avalon and I usually sat together and talked together, but it was completely platonic. Kiran hadn’t tried to do very much of either since he kissed me. I guessed since he figured out who I was, I was no longer a curiosity; he probably got bored.
I touched my fingers to my lips remembering his passion. The back of my neck got hot suddenly and the electricity surged through my veins. Confusing or not, the memory of his lips against mine made me dizzy. I noticed that Kiran’s eyes were also on my lips and he was wearing his signature smirk.
“Is he taking you to the Fall Equinox dance?” Kiran pried, forcing his eyes from my mouth deep into my own.
“Hmmm…. I don’t know,” I tried to be coy, but knew that I would say no even if Avalon did ask; dancing was not really my thing. “Who are you taking?” I asked, taking the attention off myself. I already knew the answer though; in fact, the whole school knew the answer. It wasn’t like Seraphina was very quiet about their relationship anymore.
I was not totally sure if it was because she thought I was a threat to her precious relationship, or if she was scared that Kiran really wasn’t that into her; but whatever the reason, she was no longer reserved about her feelings. Every chance Seraphina got, she was all over him, or bragging about him. She loved to talk loudly about what Kiran bought her, or where he took her. Kiran remained silent, but was always by her side lately.  
“Are you going to the dance?” he avoided my question.
“No, probably not.” I decided to be honest. I couldn’t play these games; I wasn’t any good at them.
“Why not?” Kiran asked sounding a little panicked.
“Well dances are not really my thing, besides I don’t want to go alone. Avalon and I really are just friends,” I put my pencil down and looked out the window. I’d been talking to Kiran for too long and felt like I was going to get into trouble.
Principal Saint warned me every time I saw him to stay away from Kiran, especially since he caught me at Kiran’s club the other night. As helpful as he had been in finally shedding some light on who I was; I found staying away from Kiran the hardest thing he had asked me to do. I understood that he hadn’t asked much of me, but there was something about Kiran that I was unable to keep myself from.
“Well you don’t have to go alone. You could um, come with us,” he sounded sincere, and I flashed him a grave look. He had got to be kidding me. A third wheel to a date between Kiran and Seraphina, no thank you.
“Sounds fun, but I think I’ll pass. Besides what would your girlfriend have to say about that?” I rolled my eyes.
“Well, maybe you could double with Talbott?” he suggested softly. “He doesn’t have a date yet.” This was getting ridiculous.
“Yeah…. maybe,” I laughed sarcastically, “Thanks, but no thanks your Majesty.” The bell rang and I was thankful to be done with Kingsley, at least for the day.
“That’s not funny,” he said defensively. I gathered my things, hoping that this conversation was over. If he followed me out the door and Principal Saint saw me talking to him, I was going to be in big trouble. “Eden, please wait,” he grabbed my wrist gently and I turned to look at him. Something in his eyes looked sad, like he was sorry for something.
“I just think that you would have fun if you came to the dance,” he gave me a saddened version of his custom smirk, and his eyes twinkled a little bit. The rest of the class was quickly leaving and I was afraid we would be alone in a second.
“Really, I can’t dance. If I went, it wouldn’t be fun for anyone…. trust me,” I tried to sound sincere, but my voice was breathy as Kiran pulled me a little closer, his fingers left my wrist and intertwine themselves with my fingers.
“Eden, are you ready?” Avalon was beside me and in an almost defensive stance. Oh no. I remembered my promise to Avalon and felt guilty for indulging myself with Kiran too long.
“Yes, almost,” I turned and smiled at him, refusing to drop my hand from Kiran’s. What was wrong with me? My magic flared at the memories of the last time we were this close and I regretted the fact that we were at school.
“Come on, let’s go,” Avalon’s voice was anxious and I was surprised that he was so impatient. The usually focused and clearer sensory perception that came from being around him felt tense and put me on edge. Avalon glared at Kiran, but every once in a while he turned to give me an impatient frown.
“She said she’ll be right there Avalon,” Kiran pulled me closer to him, blocking me with half of his body, and took an equally defensive pose. I could see Talbott out of the corner of my eye begin to make his way over from where he had been waiting for Kiran in the doorway.
“Let go of her,” Avalon nearly growled.
“No,” Kiran growled back and Talbott took his side, clearly protective.
“Alright, everybody just settle down.” I made my voice light, trying to soften the mood. What was going on?
“Back off Avalon. I wouldn’t do anything that would get you into trouble if I were you,” Talbott tried to step in front of Kiran but Kiran didn’t let him. He stepped forward as if he to challenge Avalon. Avalon mimicked his movement and stepped forward too.
“He’s right Avalon, you wouldn’t want to get into trouble.... again,” Kiran mocked him.
“Are you sure about that?” Avalon threatened in a deep, growling voice.
“Alright, I’ll see everybody tomorrow,” I dropped Kiran’s hand and headed for the door quickly. I was not going to get in the middle of some ridiculous boy fight.
I could feel Avalon’s presence behind me, but I refused to turn and acknowledge him. I headed straight for my car as fast as I could, hoping he’d get the hint.
He didn’t and continued to follow me, but he also didn’t try to say anything until we reached my car. He never even tried to walk beside me, although his long legs could have easily outpaced mine. He stayed behind me almost as if he was protecting me from whatever else was back there. I became even more irritated.
“I’m sorry about that Eden,” Avalon finally broke the silence as I searched for my car keys deep inside my book bag. “He just, ugh, he’s just so infuriating,” Avalon punched one of his fists into his other hand and I watched him clench his jaw.
“Well, he’s not the only one,” I gave him a fierce look and dug deeper in my bag for the keys to my Land Rover.
“Why do you even bother talking to him? I thought you weren’t allowed,” he looked at me with an intensity that I didn’t understand.
“It’s not like I try to talk to him. He is just always there! What do you mean I’m not allowed?” I defended myself, but wondered at Avalon’s use of the word “allowed.” I searched through my memories, trying to remember a time when I had been outright forbidden to talk to him.
“Oh nothing, I mean, it’s just that, like the whole betrothal thing,” he blurted out and I didn’t know what he was talking about.
“What do you mean?” I repeated.
“The betrothal between Kiran and Seraphina. I thought everyone knew. They are engaged to be married,” I stared at him confused until he continued, “I thought that was the whole reason he was at this school; he’s like supposed to get to know his future wife.” And then the meaning of the word “betrothal” sunk in. Kiran was going to marry Seraphina; no wonder she thought she was his girlfriend: she was. In fact she was more than his girlfriend, she was his freaking fiancée. Freaking Monarchy with their freaking tradition. What century did we live in? Betrothal? Out of control.
Talbott’s warning suddenly made sense, in fact, a lot of things suddenly made sense and I felt like such an idiot. He really was just using me for entertainment this entire time. I felt sick; how could I have not known.
“Oh,” was all I could manage, and my lips stayed formed by the word. But my heart dropped into my stomach.
“Hey were you planning on going to the Fall Equinox dance?” Avalon asked out of the blue, changing the subject quickly.
“Not anymore,” I reminded myself to breathe and willed myself to forget the nauseous feeling rising in my throat. “It’s not really my thing anyways.” I said softly, hoping I wasn’t letting him down. My mind was still reeling from the wedding news.
“Oh good…. Yeah, those things are dumb anyways,” his face looked visibly relieved and I didn’t understand why.
“We could hang out though; you could come over tomorrow night and we could like rent a movie or something,” I said, not wanting to sit at home, alone on a Saturday night, when the guy I had kind of liked or kind of hated or whatever I kind of felt was out having a great time with his future wife. Ugh.
“Oh no, I can’t, sorry, I already have plans. But you should definitely stay home and not go to the dance,” his expression was completely serious, and I was completely confused. “I hear it’s going to be really terrible. See you Monday, Eden,” Avalon turned and walked away to his car, leaving me standing alone, completely baffled. Boys could be so confusing.


Chapter Twenty-Five


“Eden…. Eden,” A gentle voice encouraged me to wake up and I tried, but I found myself in a very heavy sleep.
“Eden, come with me,” I grudgingly opened my eyes slowly and took in my surroundings. I was in the middle of a forest, unlike any forest I had ever seen before, although vaguely familiar at the same time. Tall flowering trees surrounded me; all unique, all yielding a distinct, but beautiful blossom of every color imaginable. The forest floor was covered in wild flowers as unique as the blossoms on the trees. Butterflies and dragonflies buzzed energetically around me, never intrusive, but fun to watch.
I found myself sleeping on a long boulder, but I was not uncomfortable, in fact I was very relaxed and felt slightly sedated. A carpet of vibrant, green grass surrounded me, layered with the petals of flowering trees. The petals in all different colors floated tenderly down to the earth like a beautiful and colorful snow. The sun shone brightly above me, warming my skin and casting rainbows on the rock. I felt completely at peace.
“Eden, come with me,” the voice beckoned to me again and I forced myself to stand, legs unsteady and my head somewhat dizzy. I did not want to leave this enchanted place. However, I followed the voice into the trees, searching for the body it belonged to. I noticed I was wearing my pajamas and felt faintly out of place in a black tank top and plaid, baggy bottoms.
In the trees it was slightly darker, the blossoms blocked out the light of the warm sun. The petals continued to fall around me, tickling my arms as they made their way to the plush ground. Bursts of light shone their way to the forest floor through gaps in the trees, illuminating the way for me. I heard a stream nearby and the sound of the water rushing over rocks gave a soothing lullaby to this perfect place.
I wandered aimlessly, forgetting about the voice. This place seemed familiar, but new at the same time. Vaguely I realized that I was dreaming, but the magic still rushed through my veins awakening my mind more and more.
I walked through a patch of flowering trees and found the stream. The water was breathtaking. The aqua river glistened and sparkled as it flowed over rocks and a shallow bottom of golden sand. The stream itself wasn’t very wide, but created a treeless path that allowed the sun to freely shine down. On the other side of the brook were more glorious flowering trees and behind them I could see the beginnings of foothills.
I dipped my foot into the cool water and let my toes sink into the sand. The sand glistened like diamonds over my toes. I thought about crossing the river to wander among the trees on the other side, but got distracted by a butterfly that landed on my hand. It floated effortlessly from my fingers to my shoulder and then back into the trees; I contemplated following it, but was interrupted.
“There you are,” Kiran stepped out of the trees and approached me. He had never looked more beautiful. His dirty blonde hair glistened from the sunlight and his perfect blue eyes were clearer than the water. He stood tall against the background of the forest. He was wearing a t-shirt and athletic shorts and his muscular build was clearly defined. I smiled, taking him in and realized that I was not at all surprised to see him.
“Where were you?” I asked as if he should have been here all along.
“I was looking for you,” he smiled, taking my hands. “Should we go for a walk?” he asked, pulling me along, intertwining our fingers.
I leaned close to him, stepping out of the water and laid my head on his shoulder. I inhaled his scent, sweet yet masculine, and felt as though this were the most normal thing I had ever done. He wrapped his arms around me tightly, pulling me even closer. I heard him sigh sweetly; the same sigh I heard during our kiss.
“What are you hiding from me Eden?” his voice was sweet, almost laughing.  
“I’m not hiding anything,” I replied without emotion. A feeling of paranoia crept up my spine sending the magic shivering through my veins. But I refused to leave his embrace. Whatever his question meant was not important enough for me to let go of him.
“Hmmm…” he sighed, contentedly, pulling me away from him so that we could continue to walk.
We moved silently through the trees; I allowed him to lead as he seemed to be walking in a specific direction. His fingers tightened around mine and I felt his body stiffen. My magic became more and more alert, awakening my senses and sending suspicion through every blood vessel.
“Where are we going?” I tried to keep my voice even, but it cracked with anxiety.
“We haven’t got much time,” Kiran replied breathlessly. “Eden what are you hiding from me? Quickly, I need to know,” he stopped moving and faced me, taking my other hand in his. His sapphire eyes searched mine, looking for the answer to his question.
For a few seconds I pondered his question, deciding what to tell him. With my hands in his I began to feel a sense of calm wash over me. My magic slowed down to a normal rhythm and my suspicion began to fade. My senses seemed dull and slow and I couldn’t think of a good reason not to tell him.
I opened my mouth, not sure of what I would say, but nothing came out. I didn’t know what I was hiding; I could feel there was something that I shouldn’t tell him, but I had no idea what it was. His cobalt eyes gazed into mine intently, willing me to speak, but I remained silent.
“Eden, what is it? You have to tell me so that I can keep you safe. I need to protect you, Love.” He begged quickly.
“There’s nothing to tell you,” I stepped back from him, trying to free my hands from his grasp, but he held on tightly.
Suddenly my senses were clear again and the magic pulsed through me at an alarming rate. Instantly I became ready for battle; my muscles flexed and I tore my hands away from Kiran’s. A hooded and cloaked figure stepped through the trees and I immediately was aware that he meant us harm.
“I am stronger than you in this place,” Kiran spoke calmly and measured, but I could hear the underlying current of rage in his tone. At first I thought he was speaking to me, but when I looked up at him, he was facing the masked man, arms stretched out as if shielding me.
“It doesn’t matter; I’m not here to kill you; only to protect her,” he nodded with his chin in my direction and a surge of magic rushed through my veins.
“I should kill you,” Kiran growled while stepping in front of me and blocking my body almost completely from the other man’s view.
“Don’t touch her,” the dark figure lunged forward, but caught himself before he was within Kiran’s reach.
They stood there staring at each other menacingly. The petals continued to fall from the trees sweetly and calmly. Complete silence surrounded us; I wasn’t sure what to do. Seconds ago I felt the urgency to flee from Kiran, but now I felt as though I must protect him; he clearly had the same instinct for me.
Confusion washed over me. Although I didn’t know who the cloaked man was, I could feel with every fiber of my being that he meant me no harm. A vague sense of familiarity flowed between the hooded man and me; his magic was very memorable. Despite the man’s peacefulness towards me however, I did recognize that he meant Kiran harm, and I refused to allow that to happen.
“Eden it’s time to wake up,” the hooded man said firmly, and I knew somehow that he was right. There would be no happy ending to this dream if I stayed.
“Please don’t be angry with me,” Kiran turned around to speak to me, his eyes pleading. With his back to his enemy, completely exposed, he gave me his signature smirk and leaned down to kiss my cheek.
I closed my eyes, feeling the magic turn to electricity, making every hair stand on end. Kiran’s warm lips on my cheek made me forget about the other man, the man that meant him harm. Such a small gesture, but his gentle kiss had me reeling with dizziness. The last thing I heard in the dream was the other man shouting a scream of rage; I felt Kiran disappear and knew that I could now wake up.
  My eyes shot open and I felt the bed all around me. I was in my room, in my bed, striped comforter surrounding me, pillows piled everywhere. I took in a big breath to slow my rapidly beating heart. The dream felt so real, the forest so vivid, Kiran’s touch so authentic.
I touched my fingers to my cheek, and a slow blush rose to the surface. Usually my feelings for Kiran were so confused, but in that dream they were crystal clear. I smiled, remembering that in my dream his feelings were the same for me.
I forced my mind to remember reality, his crown, his girlfriend, and their betrothal. My smile disappeared and I slammed my head back down against the pillows. I covered my face with my arm and audibly groaned.
My dream was not only about a sweet moment between Kiran and I, it was about his betrayal. My dream was also about his desire to know something I knew I could never tell him, although I didn’t even know what it was myself. Finally, my dream was about the hooded figure that we'd met in the forest; the man that haunted me even in sleep.


Chapter Twenty-Six


“Good morning, Eden,” Aunt Syl sat at the kitchen island sipping a cup of coffee in her white pajamas. Her hair was a mess and she was wearing her glasses; it was such a comfortable feeling. I loved having breakfast with her in the morning; it was something we rarely got to do. “I’m surprised to see you up so early. Isn’t today Saturday?” she turned to look at the clock, and I knew her question was sincere.
“Yes, today’s Saturday. I don’t know, I had the strangest dream and then I couldn't fall back asleep,” I rubbed my eyes feeling like I had had no sleep at all last night. “Have you been at the hospital?”
“Yes, since sometime yesterday…. or the day before. I can’t really remember anymore,” she yawned big, causing a chain reaction, and I yawned in response. “The days are starting to run together. Do you want a cup of coffee?”
I nodded my reply and she stood up to get a big black coffee cup from the cabinet. I sat down next to her seat and inhaled the aroma of the strong Columbian coffee she was pouring into my cup.
“Did you want me to make you something for breakfast?” she asked while handing me the hot cup and taking her seat next to me.
“No thank you, this is fine,” I smiled and looked over her shoulder at the newspaper she had been reading. While she may have been an expert surgeon, pancakes were a little out of her league.
“Hey, how are you doing with the whole Immortal thing?” she looked up from the business section of the Saturday morning World Herald and gave me a concerned look.
“I’m fine; I mean.… I’m coping,” I gave her a reassuring smile and contemplated my feelings. I hadn’t really thought things through; I’d just accepted everything at face value. I knew there were lots of things I needed to learn and sort through, but at the moment, all I could do was accept who I was and what I was capable of.
“Well, if you ever need to talk about it, I’m here,” she patted my back and kissed the top of my head. She was the reason I never felt the need to think about my parents until now.
“It doesn’t freak you out?” I asked, taking a nice long sip of the steaming hot coffee.
“Oh no, not at all. Amory and I have been friends for years, long before you came along,” she gave me a wink and I didn’t think I wanted to ask her any more questions about that.  
“But you didn’t know my parents?” I wondered out loud.
“No, I never met them. Amory and I were—" she was interrupted by the doorbell. We both looked at each other and rolled our eyes; mentally calculating which one of us was dressed enough to answer the door. The familiar tingling of electricity pricked the back of my neck and a feeling of anxiety washed over me.
“I’ll get it,” I groaned, standing up and regretfully setting my coffee down. I made my way through the large chef’s kitchen to the front room; my slippers made a padding sound as I walked over the hardwood floors.
Not bothering to look at who it was first, I threw the door open, and sent a rush of cool air into the house. I didn’t know who I expected to see on the front porch, but Talbott Angelo was probably the last person I wanted to see. He stood in front of me, dark hair combed, green eyes blazing, holding a bouquet of pink chrysanthemums. My mouth dropped open.
“Hello Eden,” he said calmly, accenting each syllable to clean up his accent. I tried to mouth something in reply, but couldn’t make a sound. What was he doing here? “May I come in?”
I moved out of the way silently and allowed him to pass; this was so strange. I instantly regretted not asking Aunt Syl to answer the door instead.
He walked casually by me and then turned around to face me again in the foyer. I glanced through the door one more time, looking for Kiran or the mailman or anyone else to rescue me from what I expected was going to be a very awkward conversation.
“I am sure you are wondering what I am doing here at such an early hour. I apologize for not giving you advanced warning. I didn’t have much warning myself,” he smiled apologetically and I subconsciously covered my stomach with my arms, wishing I had a sweatshirt nearby to throw on.
“Prince Kiran sent me over this morning insisting that I made sure you were unharmed. I see that you are,” he cleared his throat and glanced back at the front door as if wanting to escape through it. I wished he would and wondered why he didn’t.
“What? Why? What is Prince Kiran so worried about? And why didn’t he just call?” Surely there was a student directory he could use to get my phone number. I flashed back to my dream and found it strange that after such a vivid dream of him, he would send someone to check on me.
“Prince Kiran was worried about your safety. When he woke up this morning he demanded that I personally check to make sure you were alright; he seemed to think you were in some sort of danger,” he shook his head a little, as if annoyed. “And I don’t know why, but he said it was urgent. However, I can see you are just fine,” Talbott continued to stand there awkwardly holding the flowers. Despite Talbott’s efforts to be nice, I saw glimpses of the side of him that hated me. I was reminded of how rude he was to me at Kiran’s club.
“Yes, I am fine,” I said sounding more defensive than I had intended. “I still don’t understand why he didn’t just call.”
“Prince Kiran has been forbidden from talking with you. He sends his apologies,” I couldn’t help myself and let out a small laugh. I could deal with the whole Immortal thing, but all of these royal rules and standards of conduct were an entirely different matter. Talbott shot me a confused look, but I didn’t have an explanation for him and so I stayed silent. “Do you have a message you would like me to relay to him?”
“Is this because of Seraphina?” I blurted out. 
“Well yes in part, I tried to warn you,” he shook his head again.
“What’s the other part?” I asked, ignoring his ‘I told you so.’
“His father. You are a Witch, isn’t that right?” I nodded my head yes, feeling odd to have this conversation with someone other than Principal Saint or Avalon. “Kiran is not allowed to marry a Witch; he must marry a Medium by royal edict,” he said this with finality; I decided not to indulge Talbott by asking any more questions.
“Who said anything about marriage?” I grumbled under my breath.
“Eden, you must understand that Kiran has responsibilities; responsibilities that he has so far failed to take care of. He will one day become King and that requires discipline; you are only a distraction to him.”
I flinched from his words, and then instantly regretted looking weak in front of him. I was surprised by his boldness however; not many people were very open and honest with me. Despite my malicious feelings for Talbott, I could at least appreciate his honesty.
I noticed that Talbott felt bad for his harsh words and could no longer look me in the eye. He didn’t offer an apology and I half wondered if he was waiting for me to give him one.
“That is beside the point,” he cleared his throat and offered me the flowers. I didn’t take them right away, but glared at their pretty petals instead. “Eden will you please go to the Fall Equinox Dance with me tonight?”
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” I held back my laughter and eventually took the flowers from him, not knowing what else to do.
“I wish I was; please understand that this is Kiran’s idea.... no, Kiran’s order. I have been ordered to make sure you are protected this evening,” he clasped his hands behind his back and I saw a hint of his military training.
“Protected from what? No thank you, I will be just fine…. here…. alone,” this was ridiculous.
“Please go to the dance with me,” he softened his voice, but hardened his tone. “Kiran has ordered me to stay with you; but I am afraid that he is the one in danger. I need to be near him tonight,” Talbott looked down at the ground.
“You’re right, you do need to be near him, and you’re definitely not staying here with me. And I am definitely not going to that stupid dance,” the man in black passed through my mind again and a feeling of uneasy started to grow in the bottom of my stomach.
“Eden, you don’t have a choice,” Talbott said exasperated. “He’s the Crown Prince; you have to do what he says.”
“You are kidding me,” this was ridiculous. I was almost too angry for words.
“No, I’m not. Please be ready by seven,” he walked passed me and opened the door.
“What is going to happen to Lilly?” I called after him, fuming.
“I don’t know,” he replied softly.
“Well, aren’t you going to do something?” I accused, tired of being told what to do.
“Lilly Mason lied to me, and she lied to the Crown Prince, she is on her own. I cannot help her.... no one can help her,” he nearly growled the words before closing the door behind him.
I stood in the foyer, flowers in hand, staring at the door. I was so angry I could spit.
“He’s right dear; you do have to do what Kiran asks,” I turned to see my aunt standing in the door-frame leading to the kitchen, arms folded, with a concerned look on her face.
“Ahhh!” I let out a small scream of frustration, threw the flowers on the floor and stormed up to my bedroom. If I was going to be treated like a child, then I was going to act like one.

Chapter Twenty-Seven


I rummaged through my closet, throwing piece after piece of clothing into a pile on my bedroom floor. I couldn’t decide what to wear, against my will, to the dance. My nice clothes seemed too dressy and my casual clothes seemed too dumpy. I contemplated wearing the Kingsley uniform just to spite Talbott, but decided that he wouldn’t care and I would look like an idiot.
I’d never been to a dance before and I didn’t know what to expect. My high school experience had thus far been a disaster and the last thing I wanted to add to my long list of high school embarrassing moments was an opportunity to willfully show off what lack of dance moves I had. The only thing, in fact, that could get me to go to the dance was a royal decree, which was apparently what I was up against.
I was not sure if I even took the whole Monarchy thing seriously yet. It didn’t seem real and the truth was I had a hard time believing there was a King out there that actually had authority over me. It was even harder to believe that one day that King would be Kiran.
I rolled my eyes and began to rummage through another section of clothes. I paused on a black strapless dress I had worn to a funeral for one of Aunt Syl’s coworkers. The dress was tight-fitting, but had a ruffle that started mid-thigh and ended at the knee. To the funeral I wore a black, cardigan to cover up my shoulders, but I could go without one for the dance. I stomped my foot, frustrated, realizing that this date was the last thing I wanted to do tonight.
I found it hard to believe that Kiran was doing this with my best interest in mind. It seemed more like a way to torment me more than anything else. A date with Talbott, who completely lacked personality and didn’t like me anyway, all while watching Seraphina Van Curen throw herself at Kiran sounded more like torture than a high school rite of passage.
“How are you doing sweetie?” Aunt Syl peeked her head in the door and talked softly, soothingly. She had probably heard me stomping my foot and grumbling for the last couple of hours to know that I was just a little upset.
“I have nothing to wear,” I pulled my head out of the closet and glanced at the clock: 6:30. At least I had already showered.
“This came for you,” she said tentatively and stepped all the way into my room, pushing the door aside with a large white box, wrapped in a soft pink ribbon.
When I didn’t respond, she walked over to the bed and laid the box on top of my rumpled covers. I could see her watching me out of the corner of her eye, while she opened the box and revealed soft pink silk wrapped in silver tissue paper.
Since I didn’t move to examine the contents of the box, Aunt Syl did the honors by slowly unwrapping the tissue paper and pulling out the garment. She held it up, with a soft gasp. The dress was absolutely stunning; the material completely pink silk, with gold embroidery at the hem. The top cut into a deep v in the front and in the back with wide cap sleeves, while the bottom flowed out into an A-line skirt with detailed pleating. Left in the box I could see a pair of gold strappy stilettos.
“Who’s it from?” I asked, although I could probably assume.
“Oh here, this came with it,” she handed me a piece of ivory cardstock, embellished with an elaborate snake circling around to eat its own tail; surrounding the snake were dainty lilies and intertwining with the snake was an ornate golden crown. I realized I had seen a lot of snakes recently and pondered their meaning as I grudgingly read the hand written note.
I wanted to be the one to take you tonight.
Know that I’ll be thinking of only you.
“What a bunch of bull-sh—”
“Eden,” my aunt cut me off sharply. “It is a nice gesture, and a beautiful gown,” she held it closer and sighed softly. The dress was beautiful. I stepped closer to examine it and rubbed the soft silk between my fingers. I couldn’t find a label and wondered what designer was responsible for this magnificent creation.
“No. I am not going to play these games,” I said firmly, letting the material drop from my hands. I walked back over to my closet and ripped the black funeral dress from the hanger.
“Absolutely not,” my aunt shook her head. “Come with me if you’re going to be stubborn.”
Aunt Syl laid the pink dress very carefully onto my bed, laying it out perfectly. She touched it one more time and gave another soft sigh, before turning on her heel and beckoning me to follow. We walked down the hall into her bedroom.
The master bedroom was gigantic and looked like a page directly out of pottery barn. Her bed always perfectly made, was adorned with a lavish comforter and probably fifteen pillows. I imagined that it was also gathering dust since she was never here to sleep in it. We walked past her settee and 52” flat screen TV and entered her bathroom.
The bathroom itself looked like a spa, but the real treasure was in the back…. her walk-in closet. Aunt Syl’s only vice was clothing. She loved shopping and had a closet full of clothes to testify. Aunt Syl was really quite the bombshell. Her thin frame and trendy sense of style made it easy for us to share and swap, so I was excited to see what she had in mind.
She took in a big breath as if paying homage to the closet gods and let her fingers slide across the racks of clothes until she reached the back. I saw her slowly, and carefully, picking her way through the many formal dresses she had accumulated. Her fingers brushed softly, almost reverently over their various materials, moving them out of the way gently. Finally, she came to rest on one. She pulled the hanger down and turned around to face me.
I smiled. This was one of her favorite purchases. She picked it up in the middle of the summer and hadn’t had a chance to wear it yet. The emerald green dress was strapless and short, with a curving bodice. Small black and gold beading covered the front, giving it the look of a corset, while the waist was cinched even smaller with an oversized black belt. At least it would give me curves.
I took the dress from her and gave her a small kiss on the cheek. I turned to head back to my room, but not before I grabbed a pair of killer black heels. Once in my room I dressed in seconds, maneuvering my body in ways I didn’t think possible to get the zipper all the way up in the back. I slipped on the heels and pulled my black waves into an unruly bun at the base of my neck. It was messy, but it would have to do. 
I headed to the bathroom, where my makeup awaited. I was in the middle of painting on a quick retouch of bright pink fingernail polish when I heard the doorbell ring. They were just going to have to wait. I smudged my black eyeliner on, while Aunt Syl answered the door. A little bit of mascara and some bright pink lip gloss and I was ready to go.
I grabbed a beaded black clutch and stuffed it with the essentials, and made my descent down the staircase. I always imagined the walk down the tall, wooden staircase, to be somewhat magical on my first date when I was a little girl. Unfortunately, I never imagined my first date to be with someone who despised me, to a dance where I was sure to make a fool of myself, by orders from a Royal Prince who likes me but has been forbidden to talk to me; but I never had much of an imagination.
Talbott waited at the foot of the stairs, more pink chrysanthemums in hand; well, they used to be my favorite flowers. As my heels clicked on the staircase, Talbott looked up to take a look at me. The moment his eyes took me in, they nearly bugged out of his big head. His mouth dropped open and I could see that he was struggling for words. I would have taken it as a compliment except the look on his face made me more self-conscious than anything.
“Y-y-y-you can’t wear that,” Talbott stammered out.
“Why not?” I asked defensively and finished my descent down the stairs.
“Because, you can’t,” he said simply, not really giving me a reason.
“Yes, I can,” I argued back with attitude.
“Where is the dress Prince Kiran sent you? You have to wear that one,” Talbott took a step forward and I thought for a moment he was going to push me back up the staircase.
“No, I don’t have to wear that one. I don’t have to do anything. You’re lucky I’m even going to this stupid dance,” I brushed passed him and out the door, leaving him to stare after me completely unsure what to do.
“Eden, behave tonight,” Aunt Syl called after me, fidgeting with a camera she never got to turn on, as I made my way hurriedly towards Talbott’s retro limousine.
The chauffeur tried to get out of the driver’s side quickly, but I beat him to it, leaving him just as confused as Talbott. I yanked open the door and threw myself in to the back seat, landing on something soft, but not quite a car seat. I looked up and saw Kiran looking down at me, confused and surprised.
“Excuse me,” I said irritably, and maneuvered quickly, and as lady-like as possible in my short skirt off of Kiran’s lap.
“You’re excused,” Kiran replied slowly and somewhat befuddled.
“I didn’t expect anyone to be in here. I mean, I thought it would just be Talbott and me,” I tried to explain, and crossed my legs self-consciously. Suddenly, I was rethinking my choice of evening attire.
“It’s a double,” Kiran cleared his throat, never taking his eyes off of me. Talbott finally began to make his way down the walk and towards the limo. “Didn’t you like the dress I sent you?” his smirk was suddenly there and I watched his eyes appraise me.
“No,” I replied simply.
“I think I like this one better too,” Kiran cleared his throat again and I couldn’t tell if he was nervous or annoyed. “Thank you, for coming tonight,” he said sincerely.
“I didn’t think I had a choice,” I looked out of the window, hoping for a distraction. Kiran was dressed in a nicely tailored black tuxedo, shiny shoes to match. His dirty blonde hair was slicked back away from his face, accentuating his strong facial features. I had never seen him look so handsome; it was distracting me, and making me forget how mad I was.
“Don’t be so grumpy Eden,” Kiran scolded playfully, before half standing to sit next to me on the seat that was facing him. Talbott burst through the door of the limousine and I noticed for the first time that he was wearing a tuxedo as well. Apparently this was not just an ordinary high school dance.
“Wouldn’t you prefer to sit over here Sir?” Talbott had not yet recovered from my dress and was still awkward as he took a seat across from us.
“I will Talbott, stop worrying so much,” Kiran scooted closer to me as if to spite Talbott before turning towards my face and wrapping his arm around me.
My heart began to beat wildly and my magic was barely under control. Kiran’s touch brought an electrical storm through my blood and I felt it begin to boil just below the surface of my skin. I saw Kiran smirk once again before leaning his lips close to my neck, breathing softly on my neck.
“You look beautiful tonight, Eden,” Kiran whispered delicately in my ear, his breath tickling my throat gently. I felt dizzy from with him so close. “Will you save a dance for me?” I was flooded with overwhelming magic, making me forget how angry I was. I would have said yes to anything he asked, until….
“Driver, to Ms. Van Curen’s, please,” Talbott instructed the driver with authority. I suddenly remembered why this night was so preposterous and snapped out of my hypnosis.
“I don’t think so,” I said, half standing up as quickly as I could, moving across the limo and onto the seat next to Talbott. I folded my arms stubbornly and stared out the window, vowing to ignore Kiran Kendrick completely. He was not taking both Seraphina and me on a date; clearly he needed to be reminded.
To my irritation however, he only laughed, as if my rejection of him were somehow entertaining. I fumed silently; the blood that was boiling from desire now boiled from fury. I could feel the magic radiating off me as if putting up a guard that no man could cross.
Any and all hints I tried to throw Kiran’s direction apparently flew right over his head because he purposefully scooted over in his seat and sat directly across from me. He casually slid his feet next to mine, our ankles touching in the smallest of ways. I tried to maneuver my feet away from his, but the space in the limo was too confined and anywhere I moved my feet, he simply stretched his longer legs to accommodate. I saw the smile on his lips and realized this was just another one of his games. Talbott sat next to me, head in hands, afraid to watch.
The driver came to a stop in front of an elaborate mansion on the northwest side of Omaha. The house was gigantic, with immaculate detailing. The walk up to the house itself was a good 50 yards. The entry way, surrounded by tall white columns, was large enough to accommodate an elephant.
Kiran stepped out of the car and walked the long way alone. I breathed a sigh of relief and stretched my legs from out of their cramped position. Only a few minutes went by before Kiran returned with Seraphina, whom he opened the door for and helped into the seat across from Talbott. I expect her to scoot down and across from me so that Kiran could also climb in the car, but to my disappointment he walked around to the other side of the car and took his place, legs stretched out before him and all, across from me.
“You look nice,” Seraphina said sarcastically, after only seconds of entering the vehicle. Her eyes appraised me in a much less flattering way than Kiran did, and I once again felt self-conscious.
“So do you Seraphina,” I tried to return it sarcastically, but I knew the sincerity shined through, because she genuinely looked stunning. She only rolled her eyes and slipped her arm through Kiran’s as if marking her merchandise.
Kiran glanced at her approvingly before giving her a small peck on the cheek. I couldn’t blame him, although I wished I could, but she looked like a goddess tonight. Her long blonde hair was wrapped into an intricately woven side ponytail, her golden locks hanging curled and shining. She was dripping in diamonds from her earrings to her necklace to her bracelets. They complimented her floor length, bodice hugging, silver gown, and gave her the illusion that she was sparkling. Her silver gown accentuated every one of her curves and was low cut in the front, but maintained the class and sophistication my dress did not. The entire bodice was beaded and embellished and had almost a 1920’s look to it.
I understood now, why the pink gown was more appropriate. I once again was walking into an unknown situation looking like a tramp. I rolled my eyes and continued looking out the window, internally cringing. This dance felt less and less like a high school extra-curricular activity and more and more like a witch trial; unfortunately for me, it turned out I actually was the Witch.


Chapter Twenty-Eight


The limousine pulled up to the driveway of Kingsley behind numerous other stretch, luxury vehicles. I was full of anxiety and beyond irritated. Thankfully, I didn’t think Talbott was going to expect too much dancing out of me.
I watched the other students exit their cars, all of the boys in tuxedos and all of the girl’s in elegant gowns, most of them dripping in jewels. My perception of this dance was apparently dead wrong. I expected this type of style and flare at prom, but wasn’t this just the fall dance? I tugged at my short skirt, trying to cover my bare legs unsuccessfully. If I didn’t want to stand out, a miniskirt was the wrong way to go.
I glanced up and noticed Kiran watching my failed attempts at last minute modesty and laugh. I gave him a wry look before rolling my eyes and turning my attention back to the students entering the gymnasium. At least the dance was still on school grounds and not some exclusive country club, or likewise ridiculous venue.
Eventually it was our turn to exit the vehicle. The driver came around to my door and opened it so we could exit properly. I felt like I was playing make-believe, this all seemed like some massive pretend production instead of reality.
Kiran and Seraphina exited first and she was immediately on his arm. They walked regally into the gym as if they were king and queen of Kingsley. I supposed one day they would be. Yuck.
Talbott nodded that it was my turn to exit the car, but I hesitated for a moment longer, afraid to leave the confined, but private space. He cleared his throat and looked after Kiran like a worried puppy. Fine, I thought, let’s get on with it.
I exited the car with as much grace and class as I could muster, hoping to avoid a peepshow on my way out of the car. Talbott was quickly behind me. I heard the door to the car slam shut; there was no turning back. Talbott offered his arm and I looked at it with a mild sense of humor.
“Really, we don’t have to pretend,” I said curtly.
“Please, Eden; just humor me with some manners,” he offered back haughtily. I took his arm a little too forcefully and we walked the rest of the way in silence.
  The gymnasium could not be farther from what I pictured had I thought of the wildest scenario. This being my first time in Kingsley’s gym I expected basketball hoops, bleachers and maybe some streamers to decorate the place for the dance.
As soon as we walked through the wide double doors my mouth dropped open and I stood their dumbly not sure how to react. Beautiful, and elaborate black chandeliers hung from the ceiling every ten feet or so. They were adorned with white candles and dripping with colorful floral arrangements. Along the walls in every direction, candelabras in the same fashion sat evenly spaced, lighting up the room and giving the large space a dim glow.
A DJ in the far corner, spun music that reverberated the floor. Tables and chairs took up half of the space, while the remaining space was used as a dance floor. On each table were eight place settings and in the middle were replica center pieces of the chandeliers hanging from the ceilings. Colorful flower arrangements intertwined with the candle lit centerpieces over black silk table clothes.
Talbott pulled me along to our table where Kiran and Seraphina already had found their seats. Most of the tables were full already and waiters began to bring out silver platters covered in food. The food looked as elegant as the decorations. Unfortunately, my dress didn’t leave much room for expansion.
Besides Kiran, Seraphina, Talbott and me, our table was also home to Evangeline and Adelaide and their respective dates. Both of whom looked equally bored and unimpressed as the girls gushed over the dance and each other’s outfits. Not surprisingly, I was completely ignored.
I stood next to the table unsure where to sit or what to say. Talbott released my arm and pulled a chair out for me next to Evangeline. She gave me a side glance and a little snicker before returning to her conversation.
I began to sit down but was interrupted by a subtle cough from Kiran. I looked over and noticed him give a suggestive head nod to Talbott who then stood up straight, pushed in the chair he had just offered and pull out the chair directly next to it, but located side by side with Kiran. If possible I noticed Talbott become even more exasperated and Seraphina scoot her chair ever closer to Kiran. I took my seat feeling much like a criminal or leper or something equally unwanted.
“Is it what you expected?” Kiran turned his body to face me and spoke quietly; his blue eyes simmering and slicked back hair gave him a seductive quality I was having a hard time ignoring. I cleared my throat to focus.
“Not quite,” I said simply, forcing my eyes away from his. I noticed Seraphina take his hand in hers, and although he didn’t turn his body away from mine, he allowed the possessive gesture.
“Seraphina,” I found courage deep within me to pull her into the conversation. I refused to be a bizarre secret date to the spoiled Prince. “How often does Kingsley have these kinds of dances?”
“What do you mean?” she asked snidely, turning her head but not her body to face me. The look on her face made me tremble beneath the surface and I reminded myself to be brave.
“I mean, that this dance seems so extreme, is this like Kingsley’s version of prom?” I cleared my throat again, feeling more insecure than ever before, but praying my plan to involve Seraphina into our conversation worked. I couldn’t stay irritated and angry at Kiran if he continued to stay so damn sexy.
“I don’t know what you mean by extreme; this is the way a Kingsley dance always looks,” she rolled her eyes, but her tone was less derisive than before. “I guess it is nice though,” she turned her body to face us then and pulled Kiran’s arm even closer to her body.
“It’s beautiful,” I said softly, more to myself than anyone else.
“And we have one for every equinox and solstice, plus there’s Christmas and prom too,” she smiled ever so small and I felt encouraged to be braver.
“I didn’t know people celebrated those holidays,” I tried a joke.
“You didn’t know people celebrated Christmas?” she asked dryly, and her attitude was back.
“No, I mean, I know people celebrate Christmas. I didn’t know people celebrated like the fall equinox,” I did my best to clarify, but she just looked at me like I was speaking a different language.
“You’re so weird,” she rolled her eyes again and then turned back to Adelaide to pick up where they left off.
“Trying to make new friends?” Kiran asked smugly under his breath.
“Well, you’re certainly no help,” I turned my body completely away from him and looked out into the tables of students.
“Did it ever occur to you that maybe I want you all to myself?” Kiran’s hot breath tickled the back of my neck when he whispered in my ear. His accent was very alluring, and I shook my head to regain focus.
I stood up frustrated and practically stomped away from the table as quickly as I could. I couldn’t sit next to him anymore; and I couldn’t be party to his sick games. I was going to be the one that got hurt in the end.
I searched for the bathroom or a dark corner or something, but settled with the punch table. I just needed something to occupy my hands. I noticed a familiar figure pouring himself some punch as I approached the table and was suddenly very grateful to see Avalon.
“Hey!” I blurted out a little too loudly, overcome with joy to see him. “I thought you told me you weren’t coming to this thing?” I nudged him with my elbow playfully. He turned and faced me with a horrified expression on his face that quickly turned to anger.
“What are you doing here?” Avalon demanded, practically dropping his punch.
“Um, I don’t know,” I responded tentatively, unsure what to make of his reaction.
“You’re not supposed to be here, Eden,” his tone was accusing and I could not figure out what he was so mad about.
“You told me you weren’t coming either,” I accused back, not half as mad as he was, but at least it was something.
“I changed my mind,” he growled.
“Well, me too,” I folded my arms stubbornly, not sure if I wanted to stand here any longer, and not sure if I was ready to head back to the table. Thankfully, it looked like couples were beginning to dance.
“Don’t tell me you came here with him,” Avalon squinted his eyes in disapproval and looked in the direction of Kiran.
“He came with his girlfriend,” I mimicked Avalon’s facial expression and realized I sounded jealous.
“Then who are you here with?” Avalon turned to face me, his expression still hard and angry.
“Talbott,” I said softly and fearfully.
“Oh, like that’s any better,” Avalon raised his voice and gestured with his arms wildly, spilling his punch. He looked down at the puddle on the floor frustrated and instantly it was gone. I felt his surge of magic as he cleaned up the mess with only a thought.
“I don’t know what you want me to say. I was forced here against my will! I’m not happy about it either,” I raised my voice and hardened my eyes. How dare he blame me! I didn’t want to be here anymore than anyone wanted me here.
I pushed past Avalon and fought back tears. I had never felt so alone. I was tired of apologizing for things I did or people I talked to. Why couldn’t I just have a normal life with no magic, no exiled friends and no freaking Prince?
I ran through the closest door and found a staircase leading upwards. I took it not knowing where it would lead to. My six inch heels click-clacked on the wooden staircase, eventually drowning out the house music below. Soon the dance was only a faint hum as I made my way to the top.
At the top of the staircase there was only a heavy metal door with a push bar for a handle. I contemplated rejoining the party, but decided quickly against that. I also contemplated just sitting down at the top of the stairs to have a good cry, but decided quickly against that as well. In the end, curiosity got the better of me and I pushed through the heavy door.
I half expected some type of alarm to go off, but only the quiet of the evening greeted me. The cool fall air wrapped itself around me and I found myself on the roof of the gym. I took off my shoes, stepping gingerly over the cool concrete and to the ledge of the building.
All of Omaha surrounded me and the sight was breathtaking. The tall, lighted buildings of downtown sat to my east and the quiet suburban neighborhoods were located to my west. I could see St. Cecilia’s Cathedral towers to my North and the Mutual of Omaha building to my South. Despite being in the middle of a big city, the stars still shone brightly overhead. I inhaled a big breath, finding serenity for the first time all night.
“Stop being so over-dramatic. There’s no need to jump,” Kiran’s clean accent sounded amused as he entered through the roof top door.
“Go away!” I whined, exasperated, covering my face with my hands.
“Oh come now, you don’t mean that,” he walked slowly over to me, hands in his pockets, letting his eyes float over my figure.
“Where’s Talbott?” I asked, looking past him. I wasn’t sure if I wanted him to leave or not. I had never been more emotionally confused; I felt frustrated, irritated, nervous and excited all at once.
“Dancing, I expect,” Kiran glanced over his shoulder and then continued to walk towards me.
“I better join him,” I decided on my escape route. “He’s probably wondering where I am,” I walked quickly towards the door, but Kiran stepped in front of me before I got too far.
“I doubt that,” Kiran gazed into my eyes intently, his signature smirk flaring up. He took a step towards me, and instinctively I took a step back until my heels touched the ledge of the building once again. “What’s with all the hard-to-get nonsense; I thought we were passed that,” his fingers brushed my arm gently, sending butterflies and magic racing inside of me.
“That was before I learned you were engaged,” I held my ground, despite the dizziness his closeness was causing.
“I’m not engaged,” He said firmly. When I gave him a doubtful look he continued, “I’m betrothed. And the two are very different things.”
“Oh, really? How so?” I challenged.
“An engagement would suggest that I asked her to marry me; that it was my idea to get married or that we had been in a relationship prior to the proposal. But a betrothal is an arrangement made by parents; I had never even met her before I came to this school.” He jutted his bottom lip out and looked up at me from beneath his eye lashes. He reminded me of a little boy, and I couldn’t help but melt at the sight of him.
“Oh,” I gave in a little, leaning back against the building’s ledge and relaxing. “But you are going to marry her?” I asked glumly.
“Well that is what my father expects,” I heard the sadness in his tone and felt sorry for him.
“When?” I sunk down against the ledge and managed to sit down, legs stretched long without ripping my dress.
“If father had it his way we would already be married, with little ones on the way,” he joined me on the ground, and although our current position was not as seductive, he still sat close enough so our bodies touched. “We compromised; that’s why I’m here. I’m supposed to get to know her.”
“How is that a compromise?”
“The Kingdom wants stability; they want to see that their future King is steady and responsible. It doesn’t matter that I will live forever, or that my father will for that matter. They can be quite demanding,” he gave me his smirk again. At least he could joke about it.
“The Kingdom… oh brother,” I mimicked his expression.
“Yes, the Kingdom,” he gave me a playful nudge with his elbow. “And how is it that you didn’t know about our betrothal? This whole time I thought you were defying royal law on purpose!”
“Of course it wasn’t on purpose! I’m new to this whole Immortal thing, remember?” It was my turn to give him a nudge, I found his rib bones and he squirmed.
“How could I forget?” he rolled his eyes teasingly and then laid his head on my shoulder. The gesture was so unexpected, but so charming that I simply allowed it. “So, I suppose I have no chance with you now?” he picked up a rock and skipped it across the rooftop.
“Nope, absolutely no chance,” I blurted out defensively, although I was not sure if I believed myself. “What kind of home wrecker do you think I am?”
“I was just hoping that we could….” he lifted his head off my shoulder and leaned in until our faces were only millimeters apart. I knew he was about to kiss me again and no matter what I just said I was powerless to stop him.
Unfortunately, instead of butterflies and lightning storms, the magic suddenly became overwhelmingly alert and my senses focused sharply. I sat up straight before any contact was made and noticed that Kiran had done the same. We struggled to our feet just in time to meet five cloaked bodies burst through the roof top door.


Chapter Twenty-Nine


The men surrounded us quickly with the roof’s edge to our backs and readied themselves for battle. Four of the men were different from our first battle, I could tell that because their magic felt different. But one man stood apart, but familiar, the same man that escaped the forest before, and the same man that was in my dream last night. He stood directly in front of us clearly leading the attack.
Our bodies mimicked our attackers and we awaited an assault at any moment. Kiran positioned his body in front of mine as if protecting me; but the carnal instinct to fight flooded my veins. I cursed my short, tight, expensive dress underneath my breath.
“It’s time for you to go Eden. This fight doesn’t concern you,” the leader of the men addressed me and I flinched when I heard him say my name. Murderous intent mingled with magic and I was completely focused on the looming battle; but something familiar about the leader forced me to second guess myself.
“I’ll stay, if you don’t mind,” I growled through gritted teeth. I had no doubt that I would win this battle, although I was unsure yet of how I would succeed. Unlike the forest that was full of natural tools and props to use, the rooftop was bare and the fall to the ground below long.
“Get out of here,” the leader growled back, surprisingly emotional. I wanted to believe that he was asking me to leave because of the powerfulness of my skills, but something deep inside told me it was for different reasons.
“Let her stay if she wants to fight,” a different masked man, to my right taunted. “If she wants to try and protect the spoiled brat, let her,” disgust filled his voice, and there was no doubt in my mind that he meant to kill Kiran.
“Eden, go. If they are willing to let you go unharmed, then go,” Kiran commanded me. His magic was strong and I could feel the heat from his boiling blood radiate off of his skin. He was not going to give up this fight easily, but neither was I willing to let him. “What do you want with him?” I deflected Kiran’s command and addressed the leader once again. Nothing in my body was willing to settle this dispute calmly; talking it out was only a decoy until I figured out what to use to my advantage.
“We want a new King,” another cloaked figure to my left shouted. “A King who will give us our magic freely.”
“A King who will let all of our people free,” Another man roared louder. Their response was turning into their war cry.
“We want to destroy this bloodline and end the bloodshed and prejudice. We want what we were promised,” the leader spoke softer, but equally as menacing.
And then the battle began. One of the men to my right let out a battle cry before shifting into a grizzly bear, towering over the still human rest of us. He crossed the distance between Kiran and himself in less than a second. I closed my eyes expecting the fight to be over before it began, but I heard the roar of the bear and opened my eyes to see that Kiran had eluded him.
Kiran was fast, much faster than the overly large bear; but he would not last long. Another man joined his companion, shifting into a chocolate brown wolf. Kiran used his skill and power, making it impossible for either attacker to touch him, but there were three other men closing in.
I focused my magic, making it palpable in my hand. The three men, who were apparently going to remain men, were circling Kiran waiting for the opportunity to strike. The men who chose to ignore me had made their first mistake. I threw the magic at them with force, sending out a type of pulse, knocking them off their feet and surprising them all.
Unfortunately for Kiran, I distracted him just long enough for the wolf to get a hold of his arm and bite down hard. He let out a shout of rage and threw the animal-man off of him and into the wall with such force that he crushed the red brick, sending shrapnel flying around him. He sunk to the ground before shaking his head and rejoining the fight.
Blood dripped down Kiran’s arm as he tried to keep the grizzly bear at bay. The three remaining men stood to their feet undeterred by my weak attempt at disabling them. I tried the pulse again, but this time they were ready for it. The man, who had challenged me to stay, sent me his own version of a pulse; it was not as strong as mine though and I was able to block it with a defensive surge of magic. He continued on the path to fight me, while the other two men did their best to out maneuver Kiran.
I once again focused my magic, feeling the electricity surge through my veins. This time when I centered it in my hands I could see the white heat from the force of it. Just as I was about to send my powerful blow, the man on his way over, threw another one my way, knocking me off of my feet.
My hands flew apart and the magic was sent up uselessly into the sky, illuminating the dark clouds above. I struggled quickly to my feet, ripping the seam of my dress at the thigh. I sent quick pulses of magic his direction as rapidly as I could. They were small since I was unable to take the time to focus my magic firmly, but they did the trick in keeping him from advancing farther.
Kiran, with four men surrounding him, was struggling to stay ahead of them. Although he was super-humanly fast, there were just too many of them to stay untouched. The bear caught him by the back of the neck, shaking him roughly, before Kiran was able to break free. Blood dripped down his back, covering his torn tuxedo in thick crimson stains.  
He fought on, defying all odds. He continued to block pulse after pulse from the remaining humans, while keeping the animals at a safe distance. My fight with my one attacker intensified as he got a blow past me, punching me in the stomach and knocking the wind out of me. I fell to one knee, ripping my dress further and tearing the skin away from that leg. I stood up quickly sending a stronger pulse in his direction throwing him against the metal door, and denting it.
I turned to Kiran’s defense and centered my magic quickly but effectively. I threw my arms their way sending all men flying in different directions. The men recovered quickly; but the quickest of all was their leader. He stood to his feet, walking directly over to Kiran and surprisingly punched him in the mouth and then again in the eye.
No one was expecting such a human gesture, especially me. When the leader thrusted his fist into Kiran’s face, the sleeve of his cloak slid up the length of his arm and I painfully realized why he was so familiar. Around his wrist was a thick tattoo of a snake eating his tail and around his bicep, the lower half of a phoenix rising from flames. They were the unmistakable tattoos belonging to Avalon.
My mouth dropped open and I stood dumbfounded amid the bloody battle. If I would have known how to react or continue I would not have been given the chance. The mouthy and vengeful attacker from before recovered from the last blow I sent him and sent me one of his own. The electric pulse hit me with such force that I was blindsided and unfortunately unprepared.
The wave of magic threw me flailing over the side of the building and towards the ground below. Time slowed down and I felt as if I was watching the entire experience in slow motion. All five of the attackers’ heads poked over the ledge of the building as if to watch me fall to my death. But most surprisingly was Kiran, who himself came flying over the edge, diving in my direction.
Before I could realize how long the deathly fall was taking, Kiran was diving towards me and gathering me into his arms. Once in his arms, we seemingly were going to float to the ground. I relaxed, grateful to be wrapped in his protective hold.
My reaction was premature; I heard a guttural scream from the top of the building and witnessed the electric wave of magic fall from the sky and on top of us. Our descent was quickened to a sickening speed and we hit the ground with such momentum that we indented the cement sidewalk that served as a landing pad.
I closed my eyes expecting to open them to severed or paralyzed limbs. The landing was painful, the ground crumbling around us. Somehow Kiran managed to land on bottom, giving me a softer landing via his body. I heard several bones snap and wasn’t sure if they were mine or his.
I heard him groan underneath me and forced myself to assess the damage to my body. Upon opening my eyes and wiggling my toes and fingers, I realized that I was generally unharmed, except for some bruising and the gash on my leg from earlier. I awkwardly peeled myself off Kiran and struggled out of the hole we created with the impact of our body.
By this time the students and teachers from the dance began to exit the building, investigating what must have sounded like a car crash to them inside. I looked down at Kiran’s limp and unconscious body and let out a scream I didn’t realize I was capable of. I turned my head to be sick and heard other students around me gasp and let out cries of their own.
Someone came to my aid and began asking questions, but the only sound I could make was a throaty sobbing noise. I watched the men teachers bend over and pick Kiran up out of the hole formed around his body. They carefully carried him inside and I was left on the sidewalk watching after him, feeling more than helpless.
I knew he wasn’t dead, I could still feel the small pulse of his magic; but I didn’t know what kind of damage was done. He looked peaceful but mangled in his unconscious state. For the first time I realized that I had no idea what the word Immortal actually meant. What kind of destruction could we actually withstand?
The students filed past me, following Kiran’s limp body into the gymnasium. Principal Saint knelt down beside me, offering his tuxedo jacket. I took it, grateful for something to wrap around myself. The jacket was enormous and thankfully hung down past my miniskirt which had been ripped to an indecent state.
“Were you attacked again?” Principal Saint asked grimly.
I nodded my reply and heard him curse under his breath. He said something about calling my aunt. I didn’t object, but realized that I was missing the sound of sirens in the distance.
“Has someone called 911?” I asked in a hoarse whisper, barely able to hear my own voice.
“No Eden, we have our own ways of healing,” no sooner had he spoken this then a long black limo pulled in front of the school and the teachers once again carried Kiran’s limp body over the hole imprinted in the shape of our fall and into the back seat of the car.
“I must go with him. Your aunt will be here soon,” Principal Saint put a hand on my shoulder and squeezed it gently. “I’m glad you’re alright Eden.” I watched him quickly get into the passenger’s seat of the limo and then the vehicle drove away.
The rest of the students waited until Kiran’s “ambulance” was out of sight before walking to their own respective limousines. An eerie silence settled over us, except for a few of the other girls who cried like me. One of them in particular, who could not control her tears, was Seraphina. Adelaide and Evangeline helped her to a limo alone and I realized that Talbott must have gone in the other car with Kiran.
A pang of guilt hit me and my heart dropped to my stomach as I realized that I was the reason Kiran was on the rooftop to begin with. If he had been with Seraphina like he was supposed to, the attackers probably wouldn’t have found occasion to assault him. It was because we were alone on the roof without his body guard that they found their opportunity. And then it was because of me again that Kiran sacrificed himself over the ledge of the building.
“Are you alright?” Avalon, dressed in his tuxedo again, was at my side.
“Don’t,” I said simply, but my one word was filled with all of the rage I felt.
“Eden, there are things you don’t understand,” he knew I had figured out it was him on the roof.
“I don’t want to understand. I don’t want to be anywhere near you,” I spat out the words like venom. I saw Aunt Syl approaching in her red convertible and looked around, realizing Avalon and I were the only ones left standing in front of the gymnasium.
“It’s time that you do understand. I can’t lie to you anymore,” his voice was soft and sad, but it wasn’t enough for me to listen to. I waited impatiently for Aunt Syl to drive up. “Kiran has to die, Eden. We have to destroy his bloodline in order to survive.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” I refused to turn and look at him; all of the energy from the battle had turned to hate and focused completely at Avalon.
“His bloodline is the reason we are so weak. The reason we die. They’ve closed off the magic. By not letting us marry whomever we choose the magic is confined to one type of Immortal or the other. The magic can’t be free, and because it can’t be free we are all going to die. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but eventually every Immortal will fade out of existence. And if that is going to happen, I’m going to start with the source of the problem,” I shook my head as if refusing to believe what Avalon claimed was truth. “They take and kill whomever they choose and then imprison the rest of us to ensure their bloodline and their Immortality. But it affects them too and so I call for their blood to be shed. Every King before Kiran has made it worse for our people. I want to cut it off at the source before we all die, can’t you see that Eden?” his voice was pained and full of emotion.
“Why him? Why not his father? Kiran’s not even King yet,” I finally addressed his accusations.
“But he will be one day. And he will be no better than his father. Probably worse. Have you asked him about Lilly? Have you asked him what his father is going to do to her? Have you asked him why he won’t testify on her behalf even though she fought to save his life? No you haven’t. You’ve bought into his lie just like the rest of them,” he raised his voice with passion.
“Oh, but I should buy into your lie. I should just believe exactly what you say, although you’re the one trying to kill me!” I shouted, enraged myself.
“I have never tried to kill you; I’ve only tried to protect you! And yes you should listen to me, because after all I’m your brother damn it! Your twin brother!” That was it. I couldn’t listen to him anymore. I was overwhelmed with information I couldn’t discern from fact or fiction. The events of tonight had been too traumatic to even process his words, let alone believe them.
Thankfully Aunt Syl pulled up the drive. I put my hands over my ears like a little girl and ran away from everything I didn’t want to face anymore. I threw myself into Aunt Syl’s car and yelled at her to drive. After she obeyed, I let out all of the emotion once again in fitful sobs, trying to wrap my head around the words Avalon just shouted at me. Could he really be my twin brother?


Chapter Thirty


“Eden, there is someone here to see you,” Aunt Syl’s voice whispered softly but firmly in my ear.
My room was completely dark, and I was comfortably wrapped in my comforter, surrounded by feather pillows. I groaned a response and rolled over. She patted my back maternally, before standing up to open my bedroom door and allow whoever was here to see me, inside.
I heard Avalon’s familiar voice and a wave of nausea swept over me. He was speaking to my aunt about accommodations or a spare room or something I couldn’t quite make out. I heard my aunt turn the lamp on, creating a soft glow of light not strong enough to hurt my still sleepy eyes. I peeked one eye out from the pillow I had my face buried in and saw Avalon fidget tentatively in the doorway.
“Well you might as well come in; you have a lot of explaining to do,” I struggled to lecture through a hoarse whisper. In the last twenty four hours I had begun to accept the fact that he was my brother. This was the first time he had tried to speak to me himself since he told me, but I decided it was something I always knew deep within. At least I understood there was something internal that tied us together, although I was unable to put a word to it. Much like when Principal Saint came to explain my Immortality to me, Avalon was now here to explain our connection.
“You’re not mad at me?” he asked quietly and walked to the end of my bed, standing awkwardly and playing idly with the bed frame.
“I wouldn’t say that. But at least I’m not planning on turning you over to the authorities,” my voice grew stronger than a whisper, but maintained its’ hoarseness.
“Would you like some tea, my dear?” Aunt Syl offered from the doorframe.
“Yes, please,” she gave me an encouraging smile and disappeared down the hallway. “We’ll be down in a second.” I called after her, feeling suddenly awkward with my brand new brother alone in my room. Who knew what I had lying around on the floor?
I crawled out of bed stiff and sore. My knee and shin throbbed dully from the bloody gash covering them. My hair was tangled and wild, I had yet to shower; and my skin was filthy. Aunt Syl was kind enough to let me sleep through the day; I supposed sleep was how I emotionally healed.
I staggered out of the bedroom, but not before grabbing a hair tie that I worked my human-kind-of-magic with; pulling my tangled locks into some type of vice grip on the top of my head. I noticed the green dress from last night in a crumpled heap by my door; I glanced down quickly to make sure I was actually clothed. Thankfully I had an oversized sweatshirt and shorts on. I didn’t remember putting them on, but it didn’t really matter at that point, at least I was dressed. I grabbed the dress off of the floor with full intentions of burning it when I got to the bottom of the stairs.
Avalon followed me silently. On the way to the stairs we passed the guest bedroom and I noticed suitcases in the middle of the floor. I was not sure what to think of them, but was completely focused on the warm cup of tea waiting for me in the kitchen.
I tossed the dress into the fireplace casually as we walked by it on our way to the kitchen island. I lit the wood with a flick of a switch positioned on the wall next to the fireplace and glanced back to make sure the dress worked as kindle for the flame.
Once in the kitchen, I pulled out a stool and impatiently waited for the water to boil on the gas stove. Avalon followed my example and sat down on the stool next to me. Aunt Syl brought out a plate of fruit and cheese and crackers; some of my favorite munchies. I gratefully grabbed some grapes and shoved them into my mouth. I was starving.
“Amory is bringing over some Chinese food…. King Fong’s,” Aunt Syl explained tentatively and then smiled sympathetically. Great. Although I was excited for the lo mein en route, I wasn’t especially ready to rehash the rooftop battle for Principal Saint, especially when it indicted Avalon.
“So.… spill it,” I commanded of Avalon, giving him a sideways glance before reaching for some more grapes.
“I don’t even know where to begin,” he replied almost nervously, running his hands through his long locks. I realized now that our hair and skin were the same color; our noses nearly identical and our smiles the exact likeness of each other. Only our eye color was different; mine almost black like our hair, and his green like the color of emeralds.
“Start with why you have tried to kill me…. twice,” I inquired casually, holding up two fingers before grabbing some Wheatables and gruyere cheese.
“I have never tried to kill you!” Avalon nearly stood up defending himself. “I’ve only ever tried to kill him; you just give us good opportunities to attack, I guess,” he calmed down a bit and flashed an amused grin. “You always get him alone, where he is unprotected. Unfortunately you’re still fighting on his side. But I’m hoping that will change.”
“I don’t think it will,” I disagreed. “There will never be a time when I can just sit by and watch you kill Kiran,” I nearly choked on my words; realizing my brother’s true intentions for a person I had strong, but indefinable feelings for. Albeit I was not sure what those feelings were, but without a doubt they were definitely not murderous.
“We’ll see,” he argued back and when I opened my mouth to say something, he continued quickly, “Like I was saying, I have only done everything in my power to protect you; that includes doing my best to keep you away from him,” Avalon refused to use Kiran’s name.
“Everything in your power… does that include throwing me off a building?” I rubbed my sore bones to prove my point.
“Eden, you don’t have to be in pain. It’s called magic. Why don’t you try using it?” he nodded in the direction of my cut up leg and I felt like an idiot. Oh, yeah. I focused my blood, allowing the magic free reign to flow. The electricity pulsed through my veins, heating my blood and healing my body. Instantly I felt restored and rejuvenated. The gash on my shin and knee completely disappeared in seconds; and the bruises that moments ago painted my skin, vanished.
“Thanks,” I mumbled.
“I didn’t throw you off any building. Jer- my companion got a little overzealous. He was just pissed that he was getting beat by a girl. He fully expected you to recover, but you, I think, forgot to use your magic again,” I blushed, realizing that my fall from the top of the gymnasium didn’t have to be fatal. I had had the power to be just fine. “We all were shocked when you just kept falling. I don’t know what would have happened to you if that half and half hadn’t Time-Slowed to catch you; but then again Jericho got a little too excited. And if it weren’t for you, he could have finished the job, but you absorbed the majority of the blow, protecting him,” Avalon just used so many words that I didn’t understand and I had so many questions now I didn’t even know where to begin.
“Half and half? Time-Slow? What do you mean absorbed the blow? Speak English; and for goodness sakes, who is Jericho?” I squinted at Avalon confused, but he only laughed at me.
“I forget that you were raised human,” Avalon laughed again. Aunt Syl gave him a side glance, disapprovingly. It’s not like I was raised by wolves, give me a break.
“Explain,” I demanded simply.
“Ok, let’s see. Half and half is like a slang word we use to describe someone like Kiran. Someone who is half Witch and half Medium; his family specifically breeds this way in order to ensure their bloodline and their power. They think if they use the two dominant Immortalities they will stay more powerful than the rest of us minions,” his voice dripped with sarcasm and irritability. “Time-Slow; that’s like something only Mediums can do. It’s one of the things that separate Witches and Psychics. Kiran has the ability to slow time down without slowing himself down. He caught up with you in air because he slowed you down. They can only do it for a limited amount of time, but you can see why it would be useful.”
“And Jericho?” I asked, mentally ticking off my list of questions.
“I shouldn’t have used his name. But anyways, he is part of the Resistance,” Avalon grabbed a handful of crackers and shoved them into his mouth like he was suddenly hungry.
“The Resistance?” I asked; a looming feeling of foreboding washed over me. If a Resistance was involved, there was no such thing as an easy solution.
“Yes, the Resistance. The only people left brave enough to stand up to this tyranny,” Avalon exclaimed patriotically, cracker crumbs flying out of his mouth. He smiled apologetically, and swallowed quickly. After washing it down with a long drink of tea, he continued, “A lot of Immortals are unhappy with the King and have been since they instituted the Monarchy. Lucan has done nothing but divide us up and kill us off. And your boyfriend is the next executioner in line for the throne. We plan to change that.”
“Ok, slow down again. So who is in this Resistance? Are you only trying to kill Kiran? Or the whole royal family? What exactly is the purpose of this… Resistance?” my list of questions just grew longer and longer the more Avalon tried to explain.
“I can’t tell you who is in the Resistance until you join it,” he paused to wink at me and give a suggestive raise of the eyebrows. “It has to be kept completely secret otherwise they would hunt us down and execute every last one of us. I’m serious Eden, me telling you this is a gigantic risk; even saying the word ‘Resistance’ is enough to get us thrown into a Romanian prison. You can’t just run off and let your boyfriend in on all of our secrets. I mean it: mental lock-down,” he looked at me with such distrust that I felt ashamed.
“I’m not an idiot Avalon; I understand that,” I rebuffed, defensively.
“I know you’re not an idiot; I am just not sure whose side you’re on,” when I gave him a dirty look he answered more of my questions. “And yes we are going after Kiran. But it is mainly to send a message to his father, who would, of course, be our next target. The kid can’t do much damage yet, especially when he is so distracted with you; but one day he’ll hold the keys to this Kingdom and I refuse to leave the fate of all Immortals in the hands of a Kendrick,” I blushed at his reference to me; completely in denial that I could be that much of a distraction to anybody.
“Avalon you haven’t answered her last question. What exactly is the purpose of our Resistance?” Principal Saint entered the kitchen arms full of brown paper bags. The smell of Chinese food filled the room and as soon as he set the bags down on the counter I snatched one and pulled out a paper parchment filled with Crab Rangoon. I tore the legs off of the crab shaped pastry and devoured the fried goodness.
“Why don’t you do the honors Amory?” Avalon addressed Principal Saint with a strong familiarity, and slid a box of fried rice over to himself, digging in with a set of wooden chopsticks.


Chapter Thirty-One


“So you know about the Resistance?” I asked Principal Saint tentatively, not sure where he stood on the issue. He entered the kitchen uninvited, and made himself at home to no one's objections, his arms laden with paper bags of hot Chinese food.
“I believe I was the founder,” Principal Saint smiled at me widely when my mouth dropped open from disbelief. As the principal of my high school, I found it hard to imagine him plotting the death of one of its most prominent students. “That was a long, long time ago however. I’ve been able to take somewhat of a backseat position for quite some time,” Avalon rolled his eyes and I could tell that Principal Saint was not being entirely truthful with me.
“Sure, sure,” Avalon mumbled, shoving more rice mixed with Mongolian Beef into his mouth.
“Well, at least for the last sixteen years. You kids have been quite time consuming,” he grinned again. I was a little taken aback by his casual appearance. His black hair seemed a little looser; and instead of the double breasted suits I was used to seeing him in, he donned a pair of jeans and navy blue polo.
“What?” I asked, my disbelief growing.
“That has been my task since you were born: to make sure you both survived. So far, so good, but I think Eden here is bent on destruction,” I gave him an acerbic squint of the eyes, but half wondered if he was right. “In truth however, it has been the greatest task I’ve ever been given,” his expression turned serious, and something in his eyes gave me a foreboding anxiety that I couldn’t explain.
“Why is that?” I choked out.
“Well, let’s just say that you two are very important to the survival of our species,” I opened my mouth to ask him to explain further, but he continued quickly. “Back to your question concerning the King, or Lucan. He’s the same as his father and his father’s father, and the King before that. They are all tyrants. They care only for the survival of their bloodline and have been chasing Immortality since the day they lost it.”
“So we really can’t live forever anymore? Kiran could have died last night?” I asked quietly, afraid of the answer.
“Anything is possible. Some of us have definitely lived longer than others,” he smiled almost humbly as if he were embarrassed of something.
“And we all live longer than them,” Avalon said “them” with such disgust that I had no doubt he was referring to the Kendrick’s.
“You haven’t lived longer than anyone yet, Avalon,” Principal Saint addressed him with authority and I saw Avalon look down at his food with a half-smile on his face; as if he didn’t quite take Principal Saint seriously. “But it would have taken a lot more than a long fall to kill Kiran Kendrick. He’s just fine Eden, you’ll see him at school tomorrow, I’m sure.”
“So what can kill us?” I asked, once again afraid of the answer.
“Only another Immortal can kill us and in very dire circumstances,” Principal Saint shook his head as if refusing to say more. “And then there is something we call the King’s Curse; but so far it seems to only affect a person after a long life. It is much like dying of old age, only a little more gruesome than that I suppose.”
“Why is it called the King’s Curse?” I asked reaching for an egg roll.
“Because that is exactly what it is,” Principal Saint’s voice hardened. “It is a curse brought on our people by the first King, Derrick Kendrick, and grows stronger after every consecutive Kendrick that rules,” when I gave him a curious expression, he continued. “You see before we had a King our people had never experienced death. For a couple thousands of years we had walked the earth without death. Nothing could be done to us that we could not heal from, and no sickness or plague affected us. We simply lived, our powers growing stronger every year longer we survived. Finally, however, there were too many of us, we outnumbered the humans, and we were spread across the globe. Instead of thanking God for our blessings, the people grew complacent and cried out for a King. The Immortals wanted to live like the humans; even though we lived with abilities the humans couldn’t even comprehend; even though the humans lived in war and hunger and under oppression, still our people called for a King. So they elected one. One of the strongest Immortals to ever walk the earth; and how did he thank them? By destroying them. First order of business, he hunted the Oracles down and executed them.”
“Not all of them,” Avalon interrupted.
“All of them died that day,” Principal Saint growled back.
“Avalon has mentioned the Oracles before, but I guess I still don’t get it. And how did he execute them if no one had died?” I asked naively and confused.
“The Oracles were elders who guided the people before the King. They acted as a referee for disputes, and other issues that arose. They were one of the first and strongest of our species. But at that time, every kind married each other; there was no distinction between races. Because of that, the magic was much stronger than it is today. You see a Witch could marry a Titan and together they could have a Medium for a child. The magic was mixed; but each individual would display certain attributes defining what they were capable of. Derrick killed them by first draining their magic and then they were easily murdered just like any normal human being would have been," I thought for a moment Amory was going to be sick. A look of pure nausea passed across his face, but then it was gone and he continued, "The second thing Derrick did was to cut off the magic from mingling. Each race, by King’s edict, was henceforth forbidden to intermarry. This singled the magic out, not only weakening its power, but cursing us for generations to come. The King’s Curse spread wildly, destroying most of the older generations first, and then working its way down, cutting our numbers by millions. It hit the King’s household the hardest however. And to this day every King we have dies young comparatively, and worst of all they are only gifted with one male heir. It has been like this for King after King after King. Yet, they continue to oppress us, enforcing the rules even more harshly these days.”
“So that is why Kiran has to marry a Psychic? Because he’s a Psychic?” I asked, thinking very selfishly of my own problems.
“Well, in order to prolong their lives and strengthen their powers the royal family is both Witch and Psychic. They alternate what type of wife they take. Lucan took a Witch, and now Kiran must take a Psychic in order to ensure the equality of magic,” Principal Saint explained this as if it made perfect sense, but I found this entire history lesson a bit confusing.
“So if the royal family is responsible for all of this, how come the Resistance has to be a secret? Why don’t we all just rise up against them and take over peacefully?” I asked, hoping for a better solution than murdering Kiran.
“Because of the f-ing Guard,” Avalon shouted out impatiently.
“What Avalon means, is in our weakened state, most Immortals wouldn’t stand a chance against the Titan Guard. They are too skilled in battle; the community as a whole understands that we would all die. Their combat skill is what sets them apart, what defines them as Immortals.”
“And the Titan Guard is Ok with how things are being run?” I asked thinking of Talbott and his utter loyalty to Kiran.
“Well, if they aren’t there’s nothing they can do about it,” Avalon interrupted again.
“When Derrick was first crowned King, the Guard gave a blood oath to protect the royal family as long as there was any living heir. If the Guard breaks their oath they will also all die. They have no choice,” Principal Saint looked grim and tired. The lines in his face had become more pronounced, making him look ancient.
“But they definitely are the bad guys? I mean the royal family?” I didn’t really need to ask the question, I knew the answer; but I was having a hard time accepting it.
“Of course they are!” Avalon nearly exploded. “They are the reason we are dying, they are the reason we live in fear, and they are the reason your friend Lilly is in jail!”
“Lilly?” I asked in a small voice.
“Yes, Lilly.” Principal Saint replied with more control than Avalon. “When Derrick took the throne, he exiled all Shape-Shifters. He made their very existence illegal. If they were found in hiding, they were lucky to only get a prison sentence. After Lucan took the throne, their circumstances worsened extremely. They can barely call their existence living. Lilly was not hiding; she was very much out in the open. And to add circumstance to conviction she was not only attending the same school as the Crown Prince, but happened to be nearly alone with him in the middle of the forest, isolated. Thankfully for Avalon, the King currently blames her for the attack on Kiran’s life. They have not even tried to look further for more details. In his mind, she was the traitor and the orchestrator of the attack.”
“Thankfully for Avalon, but what about her?” it was my turn to get fired up and I stood up out of my stool, knocking it over behind me. My face flushed red and I turned humbly to retrieve it before sitting back down to listen to the answer.
“I don’t know, my dear. I have been called to testify, but I’m sure my testimony will only feed the jury more evidence of her crimes, since I genuinely had no idea of her true identity either,” Principal Saint looked truly distraught.
“But why? She fought against Avalon, she tried to help Kiran! It doesn’t make sense that they would blame the attack on her. Kiran and Talbott were both there, I was there, can’t we testify?” I struggled to understand what was so difficult about this. Lilly hadn’t done anything wrong.
“I know that and you know that. But my standing in the community is very precarious; I have to be careful of the battles I choose. And you Eden, are absolutely forbidden to go anywhere near that trial. You’re very fortunate Lucan hasn’t discovered you yet. I can’t say much for Kiran, but he seems to want to keep you a secret just as much as we do. I am afraid of his motives however,” Principal Saint looked down at the counter he was leaning up against and said his last few sentences quietly, as if he were talking to himself and not to us.
“Why? Why can’t I go?” I asked stubbornly.
“The simple answer,” Principal Saint looked up from the counter straight into my eyes and said simply, “They would kill you without hesitation,” I swallowed loudly, afraid to ask his reasons. By the look on Principal Saint’s face, and the tone of his voice, I understood without any doubt that he was serious.
“Amory….” Aunt Syl rejoined the conversation and gave him a concerned glare. “She’s just a child. There’s no need to frighten her,” as soon as she finished her sentence, Aunt Syl’s cell phone buzzed and she flipped it open to read a text message. I watch her expression turn from concerned to disappointed. “They need me at the hospital. Avalon, make yourself comfortable, there are clean linens on the bed and I laid out fresh towels in the bathroom. Keep her safe,” she winked in Avalon’s direction and gave Principal Saint a kiss on the cheek before exiting the kitchen. I cringed a little at the familiarity between Aunt Syl and Principal Saint, not only because he was my principal and she was my aunt, but there had to be like a huge age difference.
“Well Ok, but what about Kiran and Talbott?” I stood up and began to put the leftover Chinese food back into their respective containers.
“Talbott is not allowed to testify because of his position in the Royal Guard. By law, Titans must remain loyal to the Crown under every circumstance. Since Lucan already has charged Lilly, Talbott’s testimony would be in direct opposition to Lucan’s charges, therefore making Talbott a traitor to the Crown. And Kiran has no backbone, no sense of responsibility; the last thing he would do, is to stand up to his father,” Principal Saint accused Kiran like he was heartless and foolish. I flinched a little, refusing to believe the accusations were true.
“It’s not like he would stand up to him anyway,” Avalon yawned in the middle of his tirade. “There’s no way in hell the Crown Prince is going to stand up for a Shape-Shifter like Lilly Mason. Trust me on that,” Avalon slammed his hand on the kitchen counter to make his point.
“But why? Why do they hate the Shape-Shifters so much?” I asked out of ignorance.
“Lucan, like all of the royal family and much of the Kingdom, believe they are manipulative and untrustworthy. But even more, Lucan is extremely paranoid. He truly believes they are after his crown, and after his life. I don’t think he’s wrong to believe that now; but they weren’t always. After Derrick outlawed them, he had hundreds of them executed in the worst ways to prove his point. Things settled down for a while, but during Lucan’s reign they have escalated almost to the point of extinction. During the first several years he was on the throne, his main goal was to hunt every last one of them down. I don’t think he would have stopped killing them either, if it weren’t that….”  Principal Saint suddenly cut off his sentence and shut his mouth as if he had said something he hadn’t intended to.
“If it weren’t what?” I asked hoping to glean more information.
“If he hadn’t found the one Shape-Shifter he was looking for,” Principal Saint coughed into his hand and walked over to the sink to work on the dishes. I gave Avalon a curious glance, but he shook his head as if he was just as confused as me.
“Well, you two, there is school tomorrow, so why don’t you head off to bed. I’ll finish cleaning up the kitchen,” Principal Saint moved around Aunt Syl’s chef’s kitchen as if he knew exactly where everything was. He must have been using his magic.
“Goodnight,” Avalon yawned again, raising his hands far above his head to stretch. He turned to leave and something finally dawned on me.
“You’re staying here?” I blurted out, suddenly putting the random suitcases and Aunt Syl’s instructions together.
“Yep,” Avalon barely acknowledged me before making his exit. I heard him on the stairs and then into the guest bedroom where he slammed the door shut behind him.
“We thought it best if someone stayed here with you Eden. I think it’s best that you have some protection,” Principal Saint turned to look at me, and I found it strange that we are alone in the kitchen together.
“Why? Now that I know it was Avalon behind all of those attacks I’m not afraid anymore,” I crossed my arms and fought back my own yawn.
“Yes, I know. But you should be afraid. Kiran could be very dangerous; you don’t really know him, do you?” I held back a snotty response, realizing that they were the ones who didn’t really know him. “It’s just a precaution anyways,” Principal Saint waved it off as if it was no big deal, “Besides wouldn’t you like to get to know your twin brother a little more? I’m sure the two of you have a lot to catch up on,” he gave me a genuine smile and I relaxed. After all of the information I just received I had almost forgotten that Avalon and I were twins…. actual twins…. actually related.
“I guess you’re right Principal Saint,” I conceded, sending him my own version of a genuine smile.
“Amory, please,” he implored. “I’m so much more than your high school principal.”
“Amory…?” I tried his first name a bit uneasily, “My first question never got answered. So what is the exact purpose of the Resistance?”
“Ah,” Amory, took a moment to look out the window that sat above our kitchen sink. “Well, it has many purposes, such as to completely wipe out the royal line so that the Titans may have their freedom back. Also, to protect as many Shape-Shifters as possible so once we do have freedom again, our magic will not be missing anything and can be restored to its full glory. And then finally I suppose, to protect you my dear,” he smiled at me gently, but also a little sadly. I took his reference to me as a general idea to protect the Immortal population as a whole.
I smiled again and nodded my head; but suddenly I had a very uneasy feeling about the true meaning of his words. I remembered back when my life as a human was so simple; all I had to think about was myself. Sure, I lived in fear of what I would blow up or burn down next, but even that seemed so much simpler than now. This whole fairy tale Kingdom came with a lot more baggage than you read about in Disney books. Not to mention the super powers; they had a different playbook all together. I stalked up to my room, exhausted and overwhelmed, hoping to forget it all in the sweetness of sleep.


Chapter Thirty-Two


“Eden, let’s go!” Avalon yelled at me from the driver’s seat of his oversized truck.
I took a final glance in the mirror, and applied another layer of lip gloss, before I grabbed my backpack and rushed out the door. Avalon revved his engine, accentuating his impatience. I flung the door open, and threw my backpack in before struggling to make the climb up into his cab.
“Tomorrow we are taking my car,” I said, out of breath as I worked to buckle my seat belt, although Avalon had already taken off and was flying through the neighborhood streets haphazardly.
“Only if you let me drive it,” he replied, swerving in and out of spaces I was convinced were much too small for this tank.
“Why can’t I drive?” I whined, remembering my Land Rover with sentiment.
“First of all, you don’t use magic enough for me to trust you,” Avalon explained as if I was the unsafe driver, meanwhile I was pretty sure he just ran the last three cars we passed off the road. “Second, it’s not safe. Eden, you are in real danger whether you believe it or not.”
“I do believe I am in danger!” I folded my arms across my chest defiantly. “I believe your driving is the most danger I have ever been in!”
“You’re such a human. Relax,” Avalon demanded.  
I laughed out loud. I was pretty sure Avalon meant “human” as an insult. He could insult all he wanted, but at least when I was a human I wasn’t in life threatening jeopardy constantly.
“No, only everyone around you was at risk. Do you remember what you were like as a human?” Avalon answered my thoughts and I let out a small grunt of frustration.
“Just because you can read my mind doesn’t mean that you should,” I growled.
“Alright, alright,” Avalon lifted his hands off of the steering wheel and held them up gingerly as if to say he conceded; but I knew it was only an act. He would be in my mind as long as we lived; and apparently that was going to be a very long time.
As it turned out twins were able to connect to each other’s minds without letting their other defenses down. We could always communicate with each other and read each other’s thoughts, no matter how far away we were. Amory said that to a certain extent even human twins had this ability; ours was just strengthened because of our other powers.
I was sure this would come in handy one day, but right now I found it extremely irritating. Since he moved in with us over two weeks ago, he was always there, always around and always in my head. I found it ironic that even though Avalon and I only just met we fell easily into the role of siblings without any extra effort by either of us.
“How did you sleep last night?” Avalon asked a little more sensitively than I was used to.
“Fine, thanks,” I replied, not sure how to read his question.
“No weird dreams?” he pried further.
“No, not that I remember. Why?” I asked, suddenly suspicious.
“Just wondering,” he turned sharply into a parking spot in the student section and I was convinced he was going to scratch the cars to either side of us. When he shut the engine off, I found myself clutching the seats and holding my breath. “Calm down, Eden. See this is why you can’t drive, you rely too much on your human senses and forget to use your Immortal ones,” he jumped down from the cab with ease and I followed behind carefully but awkwardly.
We were two of the last students to arrive, due mostly to my inability to be on time. Only a few other students hurried up the walkway to their respective classes. I watched Kiran and Seraphina from a distance. Her long blonde hair bouncing with every step she took. They seemed to be laughing about something and then he held the door open for her and let her pass with a small bow. Gross.
“Let it go, Eden,” Avalon growled in my ear. He had obviously watched the same scene, but for completely different reasons. And I could guarantee his stomach didn’t feel empty and his heart didn’t tighten with jealousy after it happened.
“You’re right. He’s the bad guy,” I sighed quietly, watching him walk through the door to the English building with longing.
“And you’re the idiot,” Avalon nudged me with his hand, pushing me in the direction we needed to continue to walk.
“I just thought that… I mean he didn’t even let me thank him for the night of the dance,” I referred to the fight on the gymnasium rooftop. It had happened over two weeks ago, and Kiran had yet to say even two words to me.
“Told you. He’s the bad guy,” Avalon picked up his pace, and I had to run to keep up with him.
After the dance, it was days before Kiran returned to school. I had looked forward to each day, when I would hopefully find a chance to talk to him, to thank him for saving my life, and then to apologize to him for what happened next. But by the end of the week, when he finally came back to school, looking more beautiful than ever, completely unscratched and completely perfect, he did not pay me even an ounce of attention.
I expected to feel relieved; not only did his inattention appease Amory and Avalon; I thought I would be able to forget about him and therefore stop suffering from all of the mixed feelings I had for him. And although Amory and Avalon were quite pleased that he seemingly wanted nothing more to do with me; and although my feelings had become clear, it was not quite in the way I anticipated. I found myself missing him more and more every moment. Memories of our kiss, or the strange dreams I’ve had of him, flooded my thoughts and I realized that I had utterly, hopelessly and pathetically fallen for him in a way that must be categorized as much more than a simple crush.
“We’re skipping after lunch, so be ready,” Avalon whispered to me before opening the door to English class. I mumbled a reply, too wrapped up in my thoughts of Kiran to really understand what Avalon just said to me, and then prepared myself for the verbal lashing Mr. Lambert was sure to give me on the crime of tardiness.

----

“Where are we going?” I demanded of Avalon, as he once again controlled his truck carelessly. I gripped the door-frame and whispered a silent prayer.
“I told you, it’s a secret,” I could hear the smile in his voice, but I refused to open my eyes and view the destruction ahead of us. Suddenly the road was very, very bumpy and I bounced around violently in the passenger’s seat. If I had not been born and raised in Nebraska and realized the transition from pavement to gravel, I would have lost my lunch all together.
“Ok, fine. But why couldn’t we go after school?” I asked, as the remorse set in for skipping class.
“Don’t worry about that. We have permission,” Avalon replied confidently.
“Sure. Sure,” I decided not to argue the point as another wave of car sickness washed over me.
Just when I decided I couldn’t take anymore and the car ride seemed endless; Avalon shut off the engine and let out a huge sigh of contentment. “We’re here,” he said as if referring to his home.
I opened my eyes and breathed a sigh of relief. I didn’t know what I was expecting, but I was content with what I saw. We were surrounded on every side by corn and bean fields. The rows of farmland stretched on and on as far as I could see, rolling over hills and down into shallow valleys. The gravel road that got us here seemed endless as well, and I mentally calculated how fast Avalon had to be driving on it to get us here as quickly as he did.
Avalon was parked in front of a large two-storied farmhouse that looked as if it was just given a fresh coat of white paint; the black shutters also looked new. A long porch wound around the front of the house to the side and back where I couldn't see. A boy and a girl that seemed about the same age as Avalon and I, swung back and forth on a porch swing hanging from the ceiling.
A beautiful flower garden sat next to the house and I could see a woman working strenuously in it to pull weeds. Down from the garden was a large modern barn made out of steel siding. I noticed the green of John Deere tractors just inside the door. Behind the barn was a large fenced in area where I could see horses milling about inside its boundaries.
When Avalon jumped down from his truck, several teenage boys exited the barn entrance and made their way over to us. Avalon waved at me to come with him, and I obeyed, hesitantly. I tugged at my school uniform, embarrassed for some reason to be wearing it here.
“Well, Eden, welcome to the Resistance,” Avalon gave me a roguish smile and gestured widely with his arms as I took my place at his side.
“No way,” I said softly, but disbelievingly. I didn’t know what I had expected the Resistance to look like, but a quiet farm, surrounded by all the beauty Nebraska had to offer, was not it.
The woman in the garden looked up from her work and smiled at Avalon. She took off her work gloves and sat them down before joining the others. Avalon leaned against his truck smugly and I took in the extraordinary view again. I was suddenly nervous and not sure what to do with my hands.
“Welcome, welcome,” the woman reached us first. She walked straight over and embraced me. “We are all so happy to have you here, finally,” she sounded as if they had been waiting for me to come forever. Magic buzzed all around and I could inwardly feel all of their Immortal power.
I hugged her awkwardly, musing at her energy. In fact, all of their magic seemed different than the magic at Kingsley. Their electricity felt lighter somehow, weightless. I hadn’t even noticed the heavy feeling at Kingsley before, but now that I was surrounded by these people I felt a huge difference. It was almost as if their magic was somehow made of light. I was overwhelmed by the sensation, but I felt at home at the same time.
“We meet again,” a very familiar voice greeted me next and I pulled out of the embrace of the woman realizing that I hadn’t caught her name yet.
“Jericho,” I mumbled with mixed feelings as I turned to greet the boy who was not that long ago trying to kill me.
“Eden,” he mimicked with faux menace and I was able to pick him out of the gathering crowd.
He was definitely nothing I expected. Jericho seemed to be close to my age, maybe a year or two older. He had chocolate brown hair that hung roughly around his chin, a little bit shorter than Avalon’s. His large hazel eyes gazed into mine with an expression I couldn’t read. His nose was a little crooked as if it were broken in a fight and his sinister mouth, curved into an amused smile.
Jericho reached out a long muscled arm to shake my hand. He was almost as tall as Avalon, and each of his muscles were clearly defined underneath a white t-shirt. He was a little bit sweaty, evidence that he had been working in the barn. I took his hand tentatively, unsure what to expect.
He took my hand, firmly shaking it in his warm grasp. He smiled wider at me before giving me a playful wink and letting my hand go from his. My hand fell limply to my side as I stared at him with mouth half opened. He tucked his hair back behind his ear and I couldn’t help but find him completely adorable.
“Oh, brother,” Avalon sighed.
“You tried to kill me,” I accused defensively, covering up my initial reaction and replacing it with mock defensiveness.
“No I didn’t,” Jericho was just as defensive, but I saw the playfulness behind his eyes. I was suddenly embarrassed at my outburst as the crowd around us stayed silent, listening to our diatribe. “I only tried to keep you out of the way so we could get the job done. It’s not my fault you needed a little extra discipline,” other boys around him snickered and I felt the heat rush to my cheeks.
“Oh really? I’m the one who needed discipline? If I remember right you were getting your ass kicked,” I shot back out of pride and watched with self-righteousness as his tan cheeks colored quickly to match the shade of mine.
“Enough. You’re both awesome,” Avalon interrupted, if not sarcastically and pushed me towards the barn. I walked silently, brooding next to him.
Once inside the coolness of the barn, we took seats made of hay bales in the back, near the horses. A large white board was positioned on the wall with names and locations I didn’t recognize. I stayed close to Avalon, using him as a security blanket. Jericho sat across the semi-circle from me and I noticed a glance from him about every five seconds. I couldn’t tell if he was angry, or curious or what.
As everyone filed in to take their seats, Avalon stood up from the hay bale we were sharing and took his place in the front of the room. The woman from the garden filled his seat and placed her arm around my shoulders. At first I was uncomfortable with her closeness and the unfiltered flow of magic between us. Not a very touchy person myself, her lack of a personal bubble was hard for me take.
“Alright, everyone, let’s give our attention to Avalon,” the woman said authoritatively. She must have been in her seventies or eighties, but her hair was still long and flowed down in white curls from the low pony tail she wore. Her skin was hardly wrinkled, except near her eyes and smile. Her frame was anything but frail, and I could tell that she was strong despite her skinny bones.
“Thank you Angelica,” Avalon smiled at her with an emotion on his face that I couldn't read. I remembered that Amory told me after Avalon moved in with me that he was raised by someone named Angelica after we were split up as infants. I realized this was her and I suddenly felt more comfortable around her. "First order of business today is Eden,” Avalon turned to me and waggled his eyebrows. I was nervous, what did he mean me? “Well, this is it, this is the Resistance. Are you ready to join?” my mouth dropped open and I stood up instinctively.
I felt like I had just walked into a trap. What did it mean to join the Resistance? Did it mean I had to help them murder Kiran? Did it mean I had to plot against a King I knew nothing about? I turned from my standing position and walked as quickly as I could back the way I came. I could never hurt Kiran. Joining the Resistance was impossible.


Chapter Thirty-Three


“What is wrong with you?” Avalon asked half concerned, half pissed off.
He followed me immediately outside and didn’t let me get nearly as far away from the barn as I would have liked. The sun was warm despite the cool autumn breeze of October. The trees surrounding the farmhouse had turned to brilliant shades of orange and red. The fields had been fully harvested and made ready for the winter coming soon.
“I can’t be a part of this Avalon. I wish you would have given me some warning; maybe a head’s up, like ‘hey we’re on our way to dig your grave,’” I rolled my eyes and folded my arms defiantly.
“Ok, first of all. You would have known what we were doing if you would use your magic just an eency bit. Second of all, it was nice of me to give you the option, but you don’t really have a choice. And lastly, if you don’t join this, then we are all going to die!” Avalon was animated in his very characteristic dramatic way, I fought back a smile and forced myself to focus on the fact that his surprise attack, really just pissed me off.
“Stop being the self-righteous martyr,” I quipped harshly.
“And stop pining over the one guy that you can’t have, the one guy who is only using you, the one guy whose sole purpose is to kill everyone you love,” I closed my mouth sharply, not realizing it had been open. Tears welled up in my eyes and I watched Avalon flinch from remorse.
“I’m pretty sure he’s not the only guy using me; and I can promise you he’s not the only guy trying to kill everyone I love,” I could barely get the words out before tears began to fall down my cheeks.
“Except if I am the one who gets me killed, at least it will be on my terms. I’m not going to live in oppression under a violent dictator only to die of a horrible disease that could strike at any moment,” Avalon folded his arms the same way I fold mine, and I noticed the same defiant expression cross his face. I was kept in the dark so often that sometimes my biggest moments of revelation came through Avalon’s side of the argument.
“What about the using me part?” I asked timidly.
“Maybe I’m using you, well not you, but, fine, your magic,” he admitted. “But if I’m using you, it’s with your best interest in mind.” he gave me a playful grin.
“Sure it is,” I stuck out my bottom lip in a mock pout.
“It’s true. I’m not the only one who’s stronger when we’re together,” he turned to walk back into the barn; he thought he had won the argument. Please Eden, we need you. His voice was in my head, and I could feel, more than hear the desperation in his emotion.
“I’m not saying that I’m joining. But I will listen to the rest of your meeting,” he turned and bowed a little with his hands pressed together. I kicked a rock at him, sending it with extra force via magic and watched him duck out of the way just in time.
Instead of sitting down in my previous place I chose to stand in the back, hoping to remain anonymous. I knew that it was impossible since every person in the room was tuned into my magical current, just like I was tuned into theirs. Their lighter, brighter magic was unique and interesting. I felt their currents flow, each distinctive, almost illuminating their person. It was as if their blood was glowing from underneath their skin, only in an invisible way; like I could have seen it glow if I had held a black light up to them.
Avalon began the meeting by updating the group of twenty or so Immortals about the skirmish on the rooftop at Kingsley a few weeks ago. My cheeks burned hot as he recounted a little too in detail what went wrong and how lucky they were to get out of there discretely.
The five guys who were involved were all given pats on the back or some variation of a high five or fist pound. They were apparently all part of the reconnaissance team. Besides Avalon and Jericho, there were three other boys, all probably two or three years older than me. Avalon seemed to be the youngest and I found it odd that even though he was the youngest in the entire room he seemed to also be the leader.
Avalon then began to recount the positions of others all over the world. He named names and places I had never heard before. As small as this room of twenty appeared, it seemed there were hundreds of others all over the globe.
I had as much trouble taking the Resistance seriously as I did the whole Kingdom and Monarchy thing, but it might be more major than I could actually imagine. The way Avalon talked it appeared as if these five boys made up the most skilled reconnaissance team, but there were several others around the world. Avalon and his boys were in Brazil like he said; only he wasn’t with his parents, but rather on a decoy and extraction mission.
Avalon continued to relay information and answer questions until the light began to soften outside the barn doors. I turned, a little bored, and a little lost to look at the beautiful sunlight outside. The sky had turned brilliant shades of orange, red and pink and the sun was a blazing ball of yellow as it set behind the rolling hills of the Nebraska plains.
A black sedan drove slowly across the gravel driveway and parked next to Avalon’s truck. A tall man, dressed nicely and donning a bowler hat stepped out of the vehicle and walked with purpose towards the barn. As he got closer I picked up on his magical current and recognized Principal Saint, or Amory. The image was vaguely familiar and I had the strangest feeling of déjà vu.
I turned back around and forced myself to pay attention to Avalon. Amory stopped next to me, pulling me into a side hug and kissed the top of my head. I was surprised at his familiarity and couldn’t help but feel a little uncomfortable. Avalon acknowledged Amory with a tip of the chin and a wide grin. I forced myself to relax and trust him.
“The trial is set for the 31st of October at the Judiciary Court’s Citadel. Oscar, Ebanks, Jett and Ronan will all be charged. Another trial precedes theirs, a girl named Lilly Mason. She is a Shape-Shifter charged with hiding her identity, attending Kingsley illegally and threatening the life of the Crown Prince. She is not part of the Resistance, but in my opinion she is innocent,” Avalon’s latest update drew my attention back to the meeting.
“Will we try to extract her as well?” Jericho asked, and my heart fluttered with hope.
“We can try, but our first mission is to remove our members. I know you’re afraid for your friend, but we have to tend to our members first,” Avalon turned to me with his last comment spoken sincerely. I lost hope immediately, realizing I was the only one willing to help Lilly. I also realized I was the reason the other members of the Resistance were going to be tried.
“And when did you say the trial was? Holy Eve?” Angelica asked with a look of disgust across her face.
“Yes, I’m afraid only Lucan would find that ironic. After the trial there is an evening feast to begin the celebrations for the festival of All Saints. Some of you will be invited and expected to attend,” Amory interjected and all eyes turned towards him. I put two and two together and realized the 31st of this month was Halloween. “Conrad, Angelica, Terrance and I will attend the feast and leave the week before to make preparations for Avalon and his team. Jericho and the others will leave three days before the trial and connect with Ryder’s team once they arrive.”
“I will arrive last minute, because I have to take mid-terms,” Avalon rolled his eyes and gave Amory a disdainful glance.
“Avalon, we have to keep up appearances. Nothing must look out of the ordinary. You will travel alone directly after your last test. The tests will all be given by substitutes since the professors of Kingsley will all be required to attend the trial and festival.”
“How last is last minute?” one of the other members of Avalon’s team asked.
“I should arrive the morning of the trial, if all goes as planned. But we will not pull them until the night of the feast. We expect they will be found guilty for seditious war crimes and conspiracy against the King; in that case punishment is death. Our intel suggests that Lucan will wait to execute until All Saints Day to set an example, so we will infiltrate the prison on Holy Eve while everyone else attends the feast.”
“Surely the security will be enormous,” Angelica interjected, clearly worried about the plan.
“Yes, the entire Guard is expected to travel,” Amory took over again. “But the Crown Prince is also expected to be in attendance and so the Guard will be split between Kiran, Lucan, the royal family and then the prisoners. I’m sure during the feast they will require extra security as well,” he cleared his throat as if forcing the words out; as if he wasn’t sure he believed them.
“So that will be our only opportunity?” the man Amory addressed as Conrad said solemnly.
“Yes, I’m afraid so,” Amory looked at Avalon with a type of longing I couldn’t define.
“So we better make it count,” Avalon said with more enthusiasm than his older counterparts. “I have full faith in my team, and Ryder and his team as well,” a plan spontaneously formed in my mind.
“I want to help too,” I blurted out, focusing on my own plan to rescue Lilly.
“No!” The entire room yelled at me. Twenty pairs of eyes stared at me as if I had just said the most absurd thing.
“I mean, I won’t mess anything up…. I promise,” suddenly, I felt like the outsider I was. Obviously everyone blamed me for this mission to begin with. I was the reason their friends sat in prison awaiting death. “I know it’s my fault that this mission is even necessary. But I think I can help…. I know I can help,” I tried to explain myself, hoping for a better response.
“I’m sure you could help dear,” Angelica looked at me with a deeply concerned expression and I didn’t understand her emotion. “But we couldn’t risk losing you, it’s bad enough your brother insists on going,” she turned to look at Avalon with the same pained concern.
“It’s not necessary Eden,” Amory put his arm across my shoulder again and I felt him try to use his magic to calm me down. I shrugged it off, persistent that I would go. “Really, our teams are trained in this type of mission; you would only slow them down.” 
“But Avalon gets to go. Wouldn’t I make him stronger?” I asked, feeling naïve.
“You cannot go,” Amory replied firmly. “It’s too dangerous. I won’t allow it.”
“Can’t I just tag along then? I could learn from this trip. I won’t get in the way,” I pled my case, desperate to save Lilly.
“Enough. You cannot go. That is the end of it,” Amory said quieter, but with scary finality.
This time I kept my mouth shut, silently brooding, watching the other members of the Resistance nod in agreement with Amory. I knew I was wearing a scowl, frustrated at my lack of independence. It would have been nice to be treated as an equal, just once.


Chapter Thirty-Four


Avalon wrapped up the meeting, but I heard nothing else he said. I had to figure out a way to get to that trial. I had to figure out a way to save Lilly or at least testify on her behalf. I was determined to do it, even if I had to do it completely on my own. Avalon had said something about Kiran going, maybe he would help me.
“Are you ready for the mark?” Amory brought me out of my silent plotting and back to the center of the Resistance.
“What mark?” I asked, completely unaware of what he was talking about.
“She doesn’t want to join,” Avalon joined our conversation as the others milled about in groups of two or three. I got the impression they were all trying to listen to our discussion.
“Why is that?” Amory asked Avalon sharply; apparently not interested in any explanation I would give him.
“Why do you think?” Avalon replied sardonically.
“Eden, you have a lot to learn, young lady,” he said it much like a parent, and I felt instantly resentful.
“What is the mark?” I tried to change the subject away from what I feared was a long lecture on responsibility.
“It’s this,” Avalon pointed to his arm; his school uniform was rolled up to the elbow and revealed the tattoo of a snake wrapped around his forearm eating its own tail.
“You want me to get that?” I exclaimed. There was no way I would cover my body in a hideous image of a masochistic serpent.
“No, not that,” Amory shook his head. “Avalon is a little…. devoted. The usual symbol the Resistance wears is more subtle,” he turned his head to the side and pulled his ear lobe away from his neck. I saw only clear flesh until he touched the part of his neck just behind his earlobe and injected a little magic to reveal the same serpent. The image was much smaller, almost miniscule, but was clear and obvious until he removed the magic. Once the magic was gone, the small tattoo vanished.
“And you all have those?” I asked, enamored with the trick. A dozen Resistance members turned to show me theirs, including Jericho and Avalon. Angelica’s was a brilliant shade of orange, while Conrad and Terrence’s were an army green color. Amory’s was a deep crimson shade of red. And all of the members of Avalon’s team wore ones in white, which stood eerily off their skin, except for Avalon whose tattoo was royal blue.
“What color would mine be?” I asked, with no intentions of actually getting one.
“I am guessing it would match Avalon’s, but we won’t know until you decide to get one,” Amory answered my question, sounding slightly frustrated.
“What do you mean?” I asked, confused.
“The magic we use to apply the mark chooses your color. The magic, in a way, determines the color you deserve. Not that one color is greater than the other; rather it defines the magic you are made of,” Amory put his hand on my shoulder one more time before leaving what had turned into a circle of people, containing mostly Avalon’s team.
“You don’t get to join the team until you have the tattoo. There will be no more fighting for you,” Jericho said as if taunting me.
“She doesn’t get to join the team. Tattoo or not,” Avalon interjected threateningly. He gave Jericho a hard look that Jericho seemed to understand even though I didn’t.
“Avalon doesn’t want me to join the team, because I would easily replace you Jericho,” I deflected my frustration, by turning it against Jericho.
“Oh you think so? Maybe we should have a rematch,” his voice was sarcastic, but his eyes smoldered and I once again noticed how attractive he was. He was taller than Kiran, but his darker hair and darker eyes made him appear mysterious somehow. Any thoughts of attraction I had for him though were quickly forgotten once I remembered Kiran, and then my heart hurt with emotion and a type of longing I didn’t expect.
“I’m sorry; I didn’t catch your names?” I turned off the charm, and turned to face the other members of Avalon’s team, but not before catching a confused look cross Jericho’s face.
“Sorry. Eden, this is Xander, Xavier and Titus,” Avalon made the introductions. I shook each of their hands consecutively, memorizing the magical imprint they left in my fingertips.
Xander and Xavier must be related somehow because they looked nearly identical and their magical current was only marginally different. Xander was slightly taller, but they both had to be close to 6’5 or 6’6. Their hair was long like Jericho’s and Avalon’s and dark like mine. They both had facial hair, but Xander seemed to be a little bit older than Xavier.
Titus was also an imposing figure, only a little shorter than the other two. He also wore scruff on his face; only his brilliant red hair and stockier stature made him look more like a lumberjack than a well-bred Immortal.
“Are you twins?” I asked with honest curiosity.
“We wish,” Xander replied enthusiastically. “Unfortunately, only you two get to carry that cross,” his eyes darted between mine and Avalon’s. When I gave him a puzzled look he changed the subject. “This is my kid brother.” He grabbed Xavier around the neck and pulled him into a headlock. Xavier zapped Xander’s foot with a shot of magic forcing Xander to let go and let him stand up. They pushed each other playfully until Titus stepped in, grabbed both of their heads and slammed them together. I cringed when I heard the crushing sound the impact made. They seemed unharmed however and shook it off, rejoining the circle with smug smiles on their faces.
“So why haven’t I met you before?” I tried to refocus the group away from physical violence.
“Technically you have met us before,” Jericho spoke up. “Remember the rooftop?” 
“I mean properly,” I clarified my meaning, but I was sure they understood that from the beginning.
“Because we didn’t know if we could trust you,” Avalon said simply and the other boys averted their eyes at the awkward pause Avalon’s comment caused.
“And yet they trust you,” I said disdainfully, only half kidding.
“Cute,” Avalon mumbled under his breath. “Eden, do you mind? We need to go over some logistics before we head back. I’ll be ready soon though.”
“Sure,” I said a little disheartened. I offered a small wave and walked away aimlessly. Avalon was obviously important and Amory seemed to be mad at me; I wondered at the reason I even came to this meeting. I hoped they didn’t expect me to really join their cause. How could they?
“You look just like your mother, dear,” Angelica’s soft voice summoned me out of my pity party.
“Do I?” I was instantly drawn into her conversation by the very mention of my mother. She patted the hay bale she was still perched upon and I joined her, pulling my skirt down behind my legs so the straw would not scratch me. “Did you know her?”
“Yes of course. We all knew her. Well, except for the young ones. But how brave they are? They have never known a time without tyranny and yet they are willing to fight for a freedom that is foreign to them,” she sighed as if remembering something sad.
“I’ve never seen them before. Do Resistance fighters go to school somewhere else?” I asked, wishing I could figure out a way to bring up my mother again.
“Oh no, not here they don’t. I suppose those boys have all finished school, except for your brother,” she patted my knee familiarly. “You know, our numbers have never been this big. I suppose that means a war is coming soon.” She turned her head, and for a moment I imagined I saw a tear run down her cheek.
“Was my mother in the Resistance?” I asked, hoping to glean something from this sentimental old woman.
“In her own way she resisted; I suppose she fought against both sides. You could say that she made her own path, much like you dear,” she turned to face me again, searching my eyes for…. something. “Your brother is a good leader; much like your father and grandfather. One day I am afraid we will ask too much of you both,” she shifted her eyes away from mine and to the circle of boys listening intently to Avalon’s instructions.
“What happened to them, I mean my parents?” I asked feeling brave.
“Your brother is waiting for you, dear,” she continued to look in the direction of Avalon who seemed to be still in the middle of conversation. I was about to ask her my question again, anxious for more information other than we just look and behave like our parents, but then Avalon was looking in my direction waving for me to follow him.
“It was nice to meet you Angelica,” I stood up, and reached out my hand to shake hers.
“Oh, it wasn’t the first time we have met,” she put her hand in mine and although I couldn’t recall ever meeting her before, once our flesh met, the magic that flowed between us was familiar and sweet. Our currents mingled for a second before she let go of my hand and walked away.
“Eden, let’s go,” Avalon yelled at me, a little impatiently.
I walked passed him and towards the truck. I couldn’t remember ever feeling more irritated with him than at that moment. As far as brothers go, I thought he stood up to the expectations just fine.
“I don’t think it's fair you can’t go,” Jericho matched steps with mine.
“Oh yeah, why’s that?” I asked, truly interested, “Everyone else seems dead set against it.”
“Funny choice of words,” Jericho looked at me curiously out of the corner of his eye. “I think you should be allowed to fight. Clearly you are capable. They can’t hide you forever, especially with the way the Prince apparently feels about you.”
My cheeks instantly flamed with the mention of Kiran and his feelings for me. I pressed my cool hands to my face hoping to calm my nerves. We reached the truck and Jericho lingered by the passenger side door.
“Well thank you, I guess,” I forced myself to look him in the eye and carefully formed my next question. “Where is the feast anyway? What did Amory call it, the Judiciary something…?” I batted my eyelashes and gave the cutest confused look I imagined I was capable of.
“The Judiciary Courts Citadel,” Jericho smiled shyly, aware that I was flirting with him. “Romania.”
“How can we have our own Citadel without humans wanting to know more about us?” I asked innocently.
“The Citadel is not as large as you are probably imagining it, but it’s also hidden in the mountains.”
“It’s like its own town? Does it have a name?” I pried.
“Yes, and yes. But that’s all that you’ll get out of me,” he smiled shyly. He reached past my waist, bumping my side gently with his arm and pulled the door open behind me.
I waited for him to walk away before I struggled awkwardly into the truck cab. No matter how many times I practiced the tall steps into the passenger’s seat, I could never seem to accomplish the feat looking like a lady.
“You better change your mind,” Avalon grumbled after buckling his seat belt and starting the engine. I understood that he was referring to joining the “cause” but I chose to ignore it.
“Avalon, do you know anything about our parents?” I asked softly.
“No,” he replied quickly, but then took a long pause. “I mean, I know enough to know what kind of people they were and that they would have wanted us to join the Resistance,” I caught his not so subtle hint, but chose to ignore that one too.
“What kind of people were they?”
“Strong…. Smart…. Powerful…. Kind. Just like me,” he quipped.  
“But they didn’t join the Resistance?”
“Amory tells me, they didn’t get a chance to.” Avalon’s voice was soft and far off. Let me go with you. I pled using our mutual telepathy.
“No,” he said firmly and out loud.
I shut my mind off to him completely, angry at his stubbornness and at my own helplessness. I decided I must ask Kiran for help, I had no other option. Surely he would want to help Lilly, especially after she fought to save his life. He would have to help me.


Chapter Thirty-Five


“Ms. Matthews is there something you would like to share with the class?” Mr. Lambert called me out sharply in the middle of English class. I sat up straight and shook my head in a humiliated and ashamed “No.”
Mr. Lambert returned to his lecture and I returned to my plotting, although anything else I attempted would not be done during first period. I looked over at Kiran who was now sitting two desks away from me, with Talbott in between. I had been trying to get his attention for days without any luck.
Any note I had passed, Talbott destroyed. Any attempt at suggestive looks, Talbott interceded. Any outright demands for attention, Talbott deflected. I didn’t know many bodyguards in general, but I imagined Talbott was really good at his job.
My perfect posture turned to poor as I pouted in my desk, arms folded stubbornly across my chest. My last attempt at the “Pssst. PSSST!” obviously didn’t pan out, and so I schemed silently, determined to have an audience with the Crown Prince almighty.
I refused to let Lilly face trial alone. She did a great thing by revealing her true identity in a fight for Kiran’s life and she should have been rewarded, not punished. Besides all of the talk about execution and judiciary courts had me nervous. She was innocent as far as I was concerned and I was bound and determined to enlist Kiran in my cause.
And if he chose not to help, thereby destroying any hope I had that he actually had a soul, I would just have to do it on my own. I had to; I could not in moral conscious or as a friend to her, let her be found guilty. Kiran’s privileged life wasn’t the only life I was going to get into the habit of saving. I at least knew that I liked Lilly, and she liked me.
Kiran gave me so many mixed signals I couldn’t even identify my true feelings for him. As soon as I thought I could not be more head over heels for him, he didn’t talk to me for weeks on end and then I was confused once again.
He hadn’t even spoken to me since the Fall Equinox Dance. In fact, he hadn’t even looked me in the eyes since then. He went to all of the trouble of getting me to the dance, and then let a little thing like a midnight battle and falling from a rooftop get in the way of all the progress we had just made.
I supposed I should figure out my facts about this whole trial thing just in case he was another dead end. I knew the trial would take place on Halloween. I knew that the trial would take place in Romania. I knew that the trial would take place in the mountains in Romania; which thanks to Google, I knew were called the Carpathian Mountains. I knew Lilly would be the first defendant tried, and would probably not be facing execution, although I was not very encouraged by that. I knew that there was some type of festival after the trial took place called the All Saints Festival; but only Immortals were invited.
Basically I knew nothing in great detail, and nothing that got me on location. I needed the exact location of the Citadel; but more than that, I needed to know where the trial was going to take place once I got inside the Citadel. I also needed to know who was representing Lilly so that I could convince them to let me be a witness. I needed a passport, and I needed a plane ticket. My heart sunk with despair and I was convinced more than ever that I needed Kiran’s help.
The bell finally rung, but I chose to gather my things slowly. I watched Kiran out of the corner of my eye and noticed him glance in my direction several times before exiting the classroom in front of Talbott. I decided to pick up my pace and cut him off in the hallway. Talbott couldn’t block him from every direction.
“Ms. Matthews, I would appreciate a more valiant effort for your attention in my class, if you please,” Mr. Lambert interrupted my desperate plan with just a few snide remarks.
“I’ll do my best,” I mumbled quickly, and then thought better of it. “I really do enjoy your class Mr. Lambert. English is one of my favorite subjects,” I threw on the charm, hoping to convince Mr. Lambert of what we both surely knew was a lie.
“Then pay attention,” he retorted sharply before gesturing his arm towards the door.
I turned quickly on my heel and hurried out the door, still determined to catch up with Kiran before Drama. Mrs. Woodsen had us memorizing dramatic prose in preparation for mid-terms and I wouldn’t have opportunity once we were inside the classroom doors,
“You are an enigma,” Kiran’s silky accent addressed me softly and my own version of a smirk rose to my lips. “A beautiful phenomenon I have yet to understand. Why can’t you leave poor Talbott alone? He works so hard to keep you at bay, and yet day after day you persist. I’m afraid he is exhausted.”
“Where is he?” I asked, afraid I had only seconds with Kiran, before Talbott appeared to whisk him away.
“I gave him the day off,” Kiran’s lips twisted into his smirk, sending butterflies fluttering about my stomach.
“You can’t do that,” I protested coyly, inwardly rejoicing.
“I can do whatever I want,” his eyes hardened, and I began to doubt we were talking about the same thing anymore.
“Where are you going?” I asked bluntly as Kiran began to descend the stairs towards the lobby instead of ascending them towards Drama.
“We are also taking the day off today,” I started to protest, but he beckoned me with a nod of the head and I obeyed.
“You’re going to get into trouble for this aren’t you?” I asked, catching up with him.
“Probably. But I imagine you will too,” I couldn’t argue with him there.
We left the English and Arts Building and I shuddered at the chilly wind. Although we’d had a mild autumn so far, the wind had turned cold and as we neared the end of October the temperatures were dropping. Kiran didn’t say anything but led me towards the back of campus and the student parking lot.
“I didn’t drive, so we’ll have to take your car,” he said matter-of-factly.
“I didn’t drive either,” I said, heart dropping into my stomach when I realized I rode with Avalon like every other morning since he moved in with us.
I heard Kiran curse under his breath and then eye the parking lot mischievously. For a moment I thought he was going to steal something, but he made no move towards any of the shiny black cars lining the parking lot. He cursed again and then looked around the campus. He stared at the Gymnasium for several minutes before seemingly making up his mind.
“What are the chances?” Kiran mumbled under his breath before he resumed walking.
“That we’re attacked there…. again?” I asked finishing his thought.
“With you Love, one never knows,” he slowed down his pace a little so that we walked evenly side by side. His fingers reached out and gently played with the tips of mine. He hadn’t taken my hand fully, but the gesture was so sweet and so endearing that it sent electricity buzzing around my veins; not to mention the magic mingling between our fingertips.
“I don’t think they were after me,” I instantly regretted my comment, afraid of exposing Avalon.
“I know that,” he replied simply. He led me past the Gymnasium and down the hill towards the football field and track. I wondered to myself if anyone used these facilities. I’d never been to a game here before. Maybe they were just for show.
“Lucky for you, I’m always there to save you,” I turned to give him a playful smile, but he returned my look with an intense gaze that nearly stunned me. His aqua blue eyes sparkled, hypnotizing me as if reading my soul.
“Why is that?” We stopped walking and he waited for my answer.
“I’m beginning to wonder that myself,” my breathing became shallow and I was afraid I had said too much. I tried to cover. “Maybe you’re the one that attracts trouble.”
“Maybe….” he said thoughtfully before we resumed walking. I cleared my throat nervously.
Despite our slow pace we eventually made it down to the gates leading into the stadium. Kiran tried the gate but it was locked. Once again I expected him to use magic, but instead he looked frustrated and I heard him curse again. I reached out my hand as if to just get on with it, but before I could use any magic, he reached out his own hand stopping me.
“They’ll know where we are,” Kiran said softly.
“If we use magic?” I asked, shocked. I hadn’t expected that.
“Yep,” he folded his arms and cocked his head to the side with a frustrated look on his face. I couldn’t help but laugh a little.
“What did you do, run away to be with me?” I smiled widely; pleased with the lengths he took to get us alone.
“Something like that,” he looked around, clearly frustrated with our lack of options.
“Well, I guess we’ll just have to do things the old fashioned way,” feeling brave, I tossed my book bag over the fence and began the long, awkward climb to the top. “No peeking,” I looked down at the amused face of Kiran, and held my uniform skirt close to my body, suddenly embarrassed.
“I’ll be the perfect gentleman,” he bowed his head a little and looked at the ground as if proving his point.
I did my best to climb the fence gracefully, but it was no use. The links were small, making the climb awkward and difficult. After finally making it to the top, I had to swing my leg over in a most un-lady-like fashion, flashing the entire world I was sure. My descent down was easier, but I cringed at the thought of having to make the climb again to leave.
Once I was safely on the ground and had fully entertained Kiran, he made the climb. Of course, he made it quickly and easily. Without even using magic he was to the other side in seconds. Once on the ground, he picked up my backpack and shouldered it.
“This thing is disgusting,” he grimaced.
“What?” I reached for it defensively, but he moved out of the way quickly. “I love that bag,” I pouted my bottom lip.
“Of course you do,” We began to walk aimlessly around the track, shoulders and fingers in constant contact.
“What does that mean?” I asked, afraid of the answer.
“It means that you’re different,” when I looked at him horrified, he explained further, “I mean you’re different than any girl I have ever met…. ever.”
“Thanks?” I didn’t know whether to be offended or flattered.
“I don’t expect they thought we would ever meet,” he said cryptically.
“What do you mean?” Who was “they?”
“I mean, I don’t think it was in the plans. Neither one of us was ever supposed to come here, and I can guarantee that we were never supposed to find each other,” his explanation didn’t clarify anything, I was more puzzled.
“And why is that?” I hoped for a clearer answer.
“Star-crossed Eden, we’re star-crossed,” he gave me a very sweet smile; unfortunately I returned it with bewilderment.
“Romeo and Juliet?” I asked, giving it one more go.
“Unfortunately,” he took his eyes off me to look down at the ground.
“Things didn’t end well for them.”
“Nope,” he shook his head and kicked at a rock, sending it flying across the red, running track.
I wondered at his reference to one of the greatest love stories of all times. Despite the unfortunate ending he alluded to, I couldn’t help but dwell on the fact that the story was all about unfailing love. I glanced over at him again, but he stared intently at the ground as if working something out in his head.
“Are you going to the Festival?” I asked carefully, although I already knew the answer.
“How do you know about the Festival?” He countered my question, amused once again.
“Everybody’s talking about it,” I tried to cover, realizing I shouldn’t know about the Festival. “I’m just curious, since everything is so new to me.”
“Yes, I’m going. I don’t have much of a choice. I’ll only be gone a week or so though,” he finished his thought as if to assure me.
“Where is it? What is it?” I pried further, truly curious.
“The Festival? Basically the middle of Romania. In Transylvania; it’s near a city called Sibiu. It’s a three day long feast where we celebrate the dead,” Kiran talked about it with small tones of disgust and my hopes were raised.
“Wait. It’s a celebration?” I asked, confused again.
“Yeah, for like all of the Immortals who have died. Everyone comes from all over the world and we have this huge feast and remember the dead, or I guess during that weekend we call them the saints,” he stopped walking near the bleachers and took a seat on the stairs leading towards the metal benches. He dropped my bag at our feet.
“Oh. But what about the trial?” A look of confusion passed over his face and I was suddenly nervous.
“How do you know about that?” Suspicion clear in his voice.
“Lilly was my closest friend before she disappeared,” I spat out with more venom than I had meant to.
“Lilly Mason is a liar, a manipulator and a Shape-Shifter,” Kiran said with disbelief at my outburst.
“She fought to save your life,” I accused.
“She lied to everyone, including you,” he accused right back.
“She never lied to me! And she sacrificed everything when she decided to fight for you,” I threw the facts at him again.
“Fine. But when she did that she also chose to face the consequences. There’s nothing I can do about it now, she’s at the mercy of the law,” he calmed down a little. The initial shock of my outburst dulled.
“I’m sorry, the law? Who’s law? It’s not right, and I demand that she receive a fair trial,” I folded my arms stubbornly.
“Who’s law? Only the law that you and her and every other Immortal are bound to,” suddenly he was very angry. “I’m sorry you’re new to this Eden, but you of all people need to obey the law to the very letter. Do you even understand the consequences for an offense like Lilly’s?” I could tell that he was as livid as me, but I refused to give up.
“Of course I understand. Obey the law or face the death squad,” I replied bitterly. 
“That’s exactly what it would be like for you. But don’t be ridiculous, they are not going to execute Lilly. They just want to make an example of her,” his voice was still laced with anger.
“That’s not fair. She helped save your life. She should be like rewarded or knighted or something else as ridiculous! Not be punished because of what your awful and outdated law says!”
“Listen, I am very grateful that she was there that night, but the law is the law, outdated or not,” he quieted his voice, but hardened his tone.
“Then testify for her!” I said exasperatedly.
“I can’t do that,” Kiran replied stubbornly.
“Then I will,” I stood up, determined.
“Absolutely not,” he also stood up to face me, adamant. “There is absolutely no way you will go to that trial. You will not set foot in that country, or outside of this town. Do you understand?” his voice was raised and he ordered me around in a way I had never seen him behave.
“You have no say in the matter. If you are not willing to do what is right, then I will.”
“I have every say in the matter. As your Prince I demand that you remain in your house the entire time I am gone. In fact, I am placing you on house arrest until I return,” he was so angry and so determined that his face was red and I could see real emotion behind his eyes, but instead of trying to understand him, he only made me angrier.
“You can’t do that,” I shouted, stamping my foot.
“Yes I can, and if you push me I will leave Guards at every door and window,” his voice once again softened, but the hardness to his tone was unmistakable.
“I wouldn’t have to push you if you would do what any decent person would do! You have the power to save her, to give her another chance, but you’re wasting your influence. Instead of placing me on house arrest, why don’t you help someone who actually needs it!” I knew I had gone too far, the look that crossed Kiran’s face was pure anger. I closed my mouth, unwilling to step down, but too afraid to say anything more.
“Do not question me,” he seethed. When I opened my mouth to protest he held up one hand and I was silenced. “Do exactly what I say or I will have you thrown into prison. Do you understand?” when I didn’t respond, his voice turned even colder. “Do you understand?” I nodded, but just barely.
Kiran brushed past me with a chilling coldness that made me regret everything that was just said. He blew open the gates with one blast of magic, sending the ten foot, chain link fence flying. I watched silently as he stormed back towards the school without ever glancing again in my direction.


Chapter Thirty-Six


I was there again; wandering the same beautiful and colorful forest, looking for the same person who was meant to share this place with me. My fingers slid over the wildflowers, their velvet petals bending to my touch. A warm breeze swirled around me, sending petals dancing through the air and invoking an intoxicatingly sweet aroma.
I heard the brook beyond the trees whispering sweetly as it ran over rocks and white sand. The sun shone brilliantly in the clear sky above, sending beams of light through breaks in the trees and making a sort of polka dot path of light for me to follow. Butterflies and fireflies buzzed around delicately, their presence was comforting.
I saw him in the distance, his strong build a stark contrast to the delicateness of the forest. The light played off his skin, illuminating him through the flowering trees. His blonde hair glistened and his blue eyes pierced my soul.
Even in this dream like state I was nervous and excited. My emotions flooded my senses, leaving me overwhelmed and confused. As I walked slowly closer to him I saw that he was only wearing a pair of baggy, gray sweatpants, his chest bare. The muscles from his neck to abdomen were clearly defined; I took in the sight of him and was left breathless.
Kiran waited patiently for me to approach. His face was a mixture of emotions, none of which I could define. He stood alone, a grove of trees encircling him. The space was too small to be called a meadow, but was hollowed out by a perfect ring of forest surrounding it. He leaned against a tree opposite me; and gave me a saddened version of his smirk.
I stopped short of entering the circle, a little afraid of him but more afraid of what he wanted. His eyes appraised my entire figure before he let them fall intently on mine, beseeching me with words not spoken. The silence was so beautiful that I was afraid to break it with even the smallest sound.
After several moments of what began to feel like a pained longing, Kiran approached slowly, gently. He closed the empty space between us, pulling me into his arms and holding me close. The fears I had just felt, the apprehension that made me careful before, melted away and I let his energy consume me.  
Our magic united together in an excited aura of frenetic energy. His closeness made me dizzy, his scent had me lightheaded and the warmth of his skin against mine felt as though my soul was strangely complete. I could never have left that moment and it wouldn’t have been enough.
Kiran tipped my chin up so that I looked directly into his eyes. Leaving his fingers firmly on my chin, and with his other hand on the small of my back pulling me tighter to him, his lips found mine in glorious connection. Time stopped moving forward and the world stopped spinning and for the seconds my mouth was connected to his, I felt utter bliss.
“Eden!” Avalon screamed through the beautiful perfection of my dream, ripping me out of it in a most unpleasant way. “Eden!” he shouted again fully shaking me out of any sweet memories remaining.
“What?” I shouted back, groggy and disoriented.
“Wake up!” he said again loudly, too loudly.
“Why?” my voice was hoarse and scratchy and I could not get past confusion.
“Ummm….” Avalon struggled for a reason. “I need your help.”
“What? With what? Can’t it wait?” I turned over in bed, burying my face into my large feather pillows.
“Yeah, I guess,” he started to leave my room, but then burst through the door again. “No, it can’t wait. Come on, get out of bed,” he ripped the comforter off of me, leaving me freezing and pissed off.
“Avalon! Get a life!” I yelled, fully awake and fully angry.
“Come on,” he pleaded, not the least dismayed by my irate tone.
“What could you possibly need help with?” I asked, rubbing my eyes to make my alarm clock clear: 3:00 AM.
“Will you please help me pack?” he sounded like a little boy and I couldn’t help but feel pity for him.
“Do you really need help? Can’t this wait until tomorrow?” I sat up and pulled my knees to my chest. My teeth were chattering and my entire body had goose bumps.
“Yes, I really need help. And no, it can’t wait, I leave tomorrow,” he said the magic words. My eyes popped open and I was suddenly very awake.
He left tomorrow? That was impossible. But then again, tomorrow was the last day of mid-terms. Everyone else had already been long gone. The teachers hadn’t been there all week and several students had been missing as well. One student in particular hadn’t been at school since our fight in the stadium.
If Avalon left tomorrow that meant I had run out of time. Lilly’s trial was only thirty six hours away and I had in no way been successful in my quest to rescue her. So far I was a failure. I crawled out of bed and grabbed a sweatshirt before following Avalon to his room.
“You can’t be so careless when you’re asleep. Geez, Eden,” Avalon whined as we entered his room. At one time you could see the floor of the guest room, but that was before it officially became Avalon’s. Clothes and shoes and who knows what else littered every inch from wall to wall.
“What do you mean?” I asked groggily, rubbing my eyes again. I did my best to bring the room into focus, but I was still fighting sleep.
“I can’t save you every time you fall asleep. I need to sleep too!” Avalon was his characteristic dramatic self, but I had no idea what he was talking about.
“Save me? I don’t need you to save me. Especially when I am sleeping," I touched my fingers to my lips remembering the sweet and intimate moment I shared with Kiran just before I was awoken. Our souls mingled as one, and our magic melding to form one powerful stream of unbreakable force; in my dreams we were meant solely for each other. “Um, until you can keep him out, you for sure do need me to save you.” Avalon rolled his eyes and then walked over to his closet to dig out a black duffle bag.
“What do you mean keep him out?” my throat closed and my blood turned hot with nervous energy. It was not possible…. but then so many things I had assumed were impossible had proven me wrong.
“Out of your head. I mean you do a good enough job during the day, but come on.  Really? No one wants to monitor that garbage,” he threw the duffle bag on the bed and started gathering random items off of the ground.
“Avalon I don’t know what you’re talking about!” I raised my voice impatiently and stomped my foot like a child. I was wide awake now.
“What? Are you telling me that Amory didn’t warn you?” Avalon’s face turned white as he spun around and gave me his full attention.
“No. Now explain,” I demanded, arms crossed, glowering at Avalon like it was his fault.
“Kiran can Dream Walk. That wasn’t just a dream you were having, that was real,” Avalon spoke softly and slowly.
“What do you mean real?” I shrieked and then slunk down on the bed next to Avalon. We wore the same facial expression and our faces were the same color of white.
“He’s a Medium. They have the power to call you out while you’re sleeping. Your body stays where it is, but your mind goes to a place of their choosing. You are fully conscious, fully awake, and you should be fully aware. That is if you know what’s happening to you,” he finished quietly.
“So that place Kiran takes me to, is a real place? He is really there, he is really….” I couldn’t finish my sentence, embarrassed to say out loud the memories I had thought were only vivid dreams. 
“Well, kind of. It’s a place he has created for you at least. But yes, he is there, not physically but mentally.”
“Oh dear,” I slouched lower, realizing I might have been sending mixed signals. Or was I receiving mixed signals? Now that I had to take into play not only our physical interaction but now our metaphysical interactions I felt more confused than ever. The last time I was with Kiran he yelled at me and then stormed off; however if you count the dream I just had it was our most intimate moment so far. I missed human boys.
“So you didn’t know this entire time that it was real?” when I shook my head negatively, he began to flip through my memories. I let him, since I was as nervous as he was to find something I might have said that not only implicated him, but the entire Resistance. “From now on you have got to be more careful. You should be strong enough to protect your mind from him,” Avalon said exasperatedly, but then breathed a sigh of relief when he didn’t find anything incriminating.
“He was definitely trying to get information out of me,” I remembered the questions he asked about my identity and cringed; thankful I was as clueless as he was.
“That’s not all he was trying to get out of you,” Avalon mumbled under his breath. My face turned bright red, and I covered it quickly with my hands.
“I didn’t know it was real,” I defended myself. “I thought it was a dream!” 
“Hmmm…. I wonder why Amory never told you. That stuff can be dangerous,” Avalon’s face had returned to his normal color and he bit his thumb nail in deep thought.
“What do you mean dangerous?” I asked as Avalon stood up and began to rummage through clothes and shoes, looking for items to toss into his bag.
“Well you experienced how real everything felt. I mean that is your consciousness. Can you imagine if he called you out and meant you harm? Think about it, he could create any scenario; he could create the inner most circle of hell if he wanted. And you willingly went, without the slightest hesitation.”
I pouted my lip, ready to defend Kiran, but decided against it. The reality was he could have created anything, but instead of my own personal hell, he created the most beautiful place I had ever seen or been. And maybe I did go willingly, but I was never disappointed. Kiran was not the bad guy Avalon saw him as.
“It wouldn’t be the first time,” Avalon finished his thought and then sniffed several shirts before deciding if they made the bag, or returned to the floor.
“What do you mean?” my ears perked up, and a slow creeping sensation of jealousy made its way up my spine. If Kiran pulled this trick with every girl, I was going to be pissed.
“I mean with Mediums in general.” Avalon shook his head as he simultaneously felt my jealousy. I relaxed and then felt foolish. There was no reason to feel jealous, he wasn’t mine or anything, and in fact he was betrothed to another girl. “Remember that. But before, when the Monarchy took over, I guess they used their power of Dream Walk to torture all kinds of people. That’s how the first Immortals died,” his voice was sad but reverent and it was his turn to emote his pain on to me.
“Kiran’s not like that,” I said defending Kiran with my heart, but realizing with my head that I didn’t really know.
“Sure, sure. You don’t really know him though, do you Eden?” Avalon threw a dirty pair of socks at my face, but I batted them away quickly, afraid of all of the possible diseases they carried.
“So you really leave tomorrow?” I asked, sad that I would soon be alone, even if only for a little while. Even Kingsley would be empty. I hadn’t even seen Kiran, well in person, since he left me on the football field and Avalon would be gone tomorrow. I knew it would only be for a few days, but the thought of being here alone and helpless to save Lilly made my heart hurt.
“Yeah, right after the Chemistry final,” Avalon walked into his bathroom and I could hear him open and close cabinets until returning with a packed shaving kit.
“Why can’t I go?” I whined in desperation. Avalon held up two shirts in my direction and I nodded to the one I thought fit him best.
“I don’t know, but nobody wants you there,” he said, not the least bit concerned. He walked over to his closet and pulled out the dark cloak and mask that were the final touches to his full duffle bag.
“There has to be a reason,” I whined further.
“Of course there is. Amory doesn’t do anything without a purpose and a reason; so if he says ‘no’ it’s for a good cause,” Avalon struggled with the zipper to his duffle bag for only a second before waving a hand over it and closing it with simple magic.
“Sure it is,” I folded my arms across my chest and pouted my lower lip. “Promise me you’ll save Lilly,” I looked pleadingly at him and he rolled his eyes.
“My first objective is the team, and then yes, I’ll do my best to save your friend.” I knew that’s the best I would get from him, and although I was glad he would try, I felt more discouraged than ever.
“I’m sorry Avalon, I’m the reason your friends are there to begin with,” I looked at the ground and played with the corner of his comforter.
“That’s alright. I’m the reason your friend is there,” Avalon patted my head like a child, but I felt strangely comforted despite.

Chapter Thirty-Seven


The substitutes presiding over mid-terms were clearly human. Having been raised human my entire life, as I was reminded almost daily, I never noticed a difference between the two species. But after half a semester of Immortal teachers who not only knew everything, but saw everything, the humans they found to replace them were clearly blind and deaf to all of the activity around them.
Thankfully for them they were not actually teaching anything, otherwise I would have been afraid for them. The Immortal students left at Kingsley took advantage of the poor souls at every opportunity. They lied, they cheated and they just got up and left all together. It was a cruel joke to human teachers assuming they still had complete authority.  The teacher monitoring our Chemistry final was particularly sad. A woman in her late fifties, and nearly blind to begin with, didn’t seem to notice any of the chatter and foul play happening around her. I did my best to focus on my test, remembering that not too long ago that poor human was me.  
It wasn’t easy however, since Mr. Hayman had left a particularly nasty mid-term for us to take. To top it off Adelaide Meyer and Evangeline Harris sat behind me in constant conversation. Their high, excited voices scraped my nerves like nails on a chalkboard and it took everything inside of me not to turn around and give them a piece of my mind.
I did my best to focus on the test in front of me and refrain from magic. It would be easy to magically remember the answers, but that somehow seemed like cheating. I knew that the other students used magic for all of their classes, but I was determined to learn on my own.
“No way,” Evangeline’s shriek pulled me away from concentration once again.
“What?” Adelaide amazed me with her dramatic concern.
“We’re not going now!” Evangeline was near tears and her voice found a painfully high pitch.
“What!” Adelaide repeated in an equally high voice.
“Dad and Mom have to fly to India instead. Apparently it’s on business for the King, but that means I can’t go to the Festival!” I could hear her voice crack. I peeked over my shoulder to confirm the tears running down her cheeks. I saw her frantically typing on the small keyboard of her cell phone.
“But that’s not fair!” Adelaide confirmed Evangeline’s spoiled attitude. Maybe Evangeline and I should hang out while everybody else lived it up in Romania.
“I know! They said I can’t go unsupervised. It’s not like I’m flying coach, its first class for god’s sake.” Evangeline cried.
“You could go with us on Daddy’s private jet. We have plenty of room! Daddy’s jet is super posh; we don’t even bother with customs!” Adelaide was bubbling over with excitement at the solution to Evangeline’s problems.
“That would be so much better than flying on those dirty planes and standing in line!” Evangeline perked up and I heard her return to frantically texting. “They said that would be fine! Mom is going to call your mom,” she shrieked again, only that time in an excited even more irritating way. “I even brought my things! We were supposed to leave right after this test. Where are you staying?”
Adelaide began rambling on and on about their swanky accommodations inside the Citadel, while I rolled my eyes. But then suddenly, a plan formed in my mind that was so ingenious I would have been a fool not to follow through. I glanced at the clock, only twenty more minutes left. I knew I said I wouldn’t use magic on a human but this was different. It was life or death.
I quickly filled the rest of my test in, giving it a once over with magic before standing up to turn it in. The substitute shot me a curious look and opened her mouth as if to decline my gesture. I gave her a worried smile and walked quickly to her desk.
“Excuse me, but you need to sit down for the remainder of the hour,” she said in a warbled, but firm voice.
“I’m so sorry,” I gave her a frantic face and threw my test down on her desk. “I really have to use the restroom,” I said in the softest voice a human could still hear. Several students, who had super-human hearing, snickered around me.
“You’ll have to wait,” she replied even firmer.
“You don’t understand,” I pled, and then pushed a little magic on her. I saw her think it over again before offering me a pleasant smile. 
“Of course, dear, if it’s an emergency,” she gestured with her hand towards the door, before returning to the erotic romance novel that was occupying her time.
I didn’t even bother to smile back as guilt filled me. I reminded myself that this was for a good cause and picked up my pace as I sprinted across campus. The crisp autumn air stunned me a little as I burst out of the Science Building and towards the Administration Building.
Once I reached the Administration Building I flung the door open with magic, too excited to slow down. Mrs. Truance and Principal Saint had not been here all week, but thanks to Avalon, I knew that the students leaving directly after class today put their respective bags behind Mrs. Truance’s circulation desk.
Out of breath, and jittery with nerves I leaped over the wide mahogany, frantic to beat the clock. Any minute students would be pouring through those doors excited for a long weekend abroad. I had to get out of there before Avalon or Evangeline were one of those students. 
The floor was piled high with expensive designer suitcases and I realized I had no idea which one was Evangeline’s. I did my best to calm my nerves and focus. I let the magic center my mind and drift through the Louis Vuittons, Tumi and Coach Travel Sets in search of Evangeline’s carry on.
I felt my magic swirl around me, in and out of the piles of luggage. I sensed passport after passport and airline ticket or gate passes for private jets, but I forced myself to refrain from taking just anyone’s. Eventually I felt it, deep inside a brown leather oversized purse sitting on top of Mrs. Truance’s desk. I crawled over the chasm of suitcases and used magic to pull the golden zipper back. I couldn’t have anyone dusting for prints.
I began to reach my hand inside of the bag ever so carefully, when the brass doors to the lobby slammed open and a torrent of students flooded the lobby. In my excitement and nervousness I knocked Evangeline’s purse over, spilling the contents all over the floor. I joined them as quickly as I could, lying flat on my stomach and thinking as fast as my mind would work.
I had only seconds and my mind was reeling. Evangeline’s passport and airline ticket were conveniently tucked together in a discrete leather portfolio. The portfolio unfortunately slid underneath Mrs. Truance’s desk due to my clumsiness. I focused my frenzied magic on the portfolio flipping it open quickly. I reached for the ticket but it was too far away.
With a quick nod, reminiscent of I Dream of Jeanie, the ticket flew into my hand along with the passport and I scrambled to my feet, tucking the precious papers into the middle of my backpack. I breathed a sigh of relief and shouldered my pack. Luckily, the students I was so afraid of were only underclassmen and completely unaware that I was committing theft. I slipped through the crowd and then the back door leading into the courtyard.
I smiled graciously as I passed Adelaide and Evangeline on the brick walkway; they returned my look with confusion and disdain. If only they knew they had just solved my most unsolvable problem. I walked quickly to the car, the weather was very cool and I hadn’t bothered with a coat.
Normally I would have had to wait for Avalon and his keys before I could sit in the warmth and sanctuary of a car that would take me away from Kingsley; but since Avalon had to be dropped off at the airport today, I was in control. I pushed the button on my keyless entry and heard the glorious sound of the doors unlocking. I loved my Land Rover.
I shoved my backpack deep into the back seat and turned on the radio. I flipped through the stations, searching out something soothing and soft. I had to completely clear my mind in order to fool Avalon. If one small thought passed through my mind about what I had suddenly planned he would no doubt pick up on it immediately, if he hadn't already figured it out just by paying attention to our twin connection. But I hoped for the best, and repressed my magic and made it miniscule; hopefully I would also turn off the switch to our weird twin vibe.
I couldn't get rid of my nerves completely though and so I was still on edge when Avalon banged on the window in an attempt to scare me, it worked. I let out a blood curdling scream and nearly peed my pants. Pleased with himself, Avalon hopped into the passenger's seat all smiles and excitement.
“Chill out,” he said, still laughing.
“Don’t do that!” I scolded, heart beating wildly.
“How many times do I have to remind you to use your magic? If you were tuned into your surroundings I wouldn’t be able to do that,” he shook his head in mock disappointment.
“You’re right,” I tried to laugh it off, hoping to end the conversation immediately.
“What are we listening to?” Avalon made a disgusted face before taking over the seek-and-scan. He changed the university classical station to one that was more contemporary and…. loud.
I pulled out of the parking lot and filed in behind the long line of cars en route to the small airport Omaha had to offer. We merged onto the Interstate heading northeast in direction of Eppley Airfield. Some of the more expensive cars eventually made a turn for the northwest probably headed to the private airfields or who knows maybe their very own runways built into their very own expensive backyards.
The twenty minute drive was made in silence. Through the upbeat rap music I could tell that Avalon was focusing on the task ahead. He chewed on his thumbnail with his forehead creased together and stared out the window oblivious to anything around him. Although I was thankful for his less than interested approach with me, for the first time I realized he was nervous for the mission.
I had been so focused on Lilly and what her outcome at the trial would be that I completely overlooked the dangerous steps Avalon was about to take. If he was caught, I was sure he would share the same punishment as his accused companions. I glanced over at him and a pit began to form in my stomach. What was I asking him to do?
Avalon’s mission to save the team I condemned was enough. I was selfish to ask him to carry out what should be my mission. I would save Lilly, if not by testimony then by extreme force. I didn’t know these people, but I would be damned if I left my only friend’s fate in their hands.
“When does your flight leave?” I asked, trying to focus Avalon’s mind on the here and now.
“1:03, Southwest,” he nodded in the direction of the drop off lane, but I had decided a long time ago I would at least walk my brother inside.
“No, I’ll walk you in and say goodbye,” I glanced at the clock and realized he was going to have to run to make his flight. I wondered if I would have to do the same, but quickly banished the thought before Avalon could catch on.
I parked the car in the multi-level parking garage and popped the trunk for Avalon. While he was transferring a few things from his backpack to his duffle bag, I grabbed my own backpack and dumped the books, leaving only the necessities. I took a glance at the ticket noticing my time of departure was 1:24, so I would have only minutes after Avalon took off to get where I needed to go.
I would need to wait until Avalon was in the air before I made any move for my plane, otherwise he would know. I glanced back at him; he was clearly still preoccupied with his mission. From the two missions I fought against him prior to this one, I had assumed he was fearless or at least enjoyed the fight, but by the expression on his face it was clear that he knew exactly what he was risking.
“Are you ready?” I asked, laying a concerned hand on his shoulder.
“Of course,” he smiled, shaking his head a little as if to bring himself out of something.
“Then let’s go. I want to see you take off,” he rolled his eyes, but didn’t object.
We walked across the drive way and into the airport. Omaha’s Eppley Airfield was small and practical. Since Omaha didn’t fly directly International, all flights would have to make a connection somewhere else. Avalon’s was Minneapolis, mine was thankfully Atlanta.
I could feel Avalon’s magic strong and purposeful as he checked in and handed his passport and ticket to the clerk. I took notes silently beside him. My first use of magic on a human happened today with the substitute and I was filled with guilt afterward. Avalon used magic seamlessly with humans and I could tell from his aura that he didn’t feel the least bit guilty.
After a minute though, I could see why. Avalon’s magic helped the human girl to focus. Everything with his check in went quickly and smoothly and neither one had anything to complain about. He only bent her mind a little bit, but it was for her sake, as well as his. He noticed my observation and then turned to give me a look that said, “And that’s how it’s done.” I rolled my eyes, but was inwardly impressed.
I gave him a long hug at the top of the escalator leading to his terminal. He let me and didn’t let go until I did. I tried to find the right words of encouragement but nothing poetic came to mind. He smiled at my efforts and then winked before turning to walk away.
Be safe. Do not do anything stupid while I’m gone. His stern voice was in my head, but inwardly I was too choked up at his show of affection to respond.
“Did you hear me?” he turned around to walk backwards towards the security checkpoint.
I nodded affirmatively and wiped a tear off of my cheek. He shook his head and then he was to security and having to take off his shoes and jacket; oh no, his jacket. I realized for the first time that Avalon changed clothes before he left school. He was dressed very nicely in a tailored black pin striped suit and white shirt with a green tie underneath. He put his shiny black shoes into the bin and I noticed that even his socks were fancy.
It was my turn to check in and I was standing there looking lost in a gross school uniform. I was apparently planning to storm the courtroom and demand Lilly Mason be freed from tyranny and unlawfulness in knee high socks and a plaid pleated skirt. Awesome.


Chapter Thirty-Eight


I took a quick glance at Evangeline’s passport before handing it over to the desk clerk, a twenty something girl with too much make-up on. Luckily for me, Evangeline’s passport picture was taken when she was ten and so there was a little leeway for growth.
Although she was still a brunette six years after the picture was taken, my shade of brown was not so nutmeg, but rather just straight black. And her eyes were definitely blue, and mine were definitely not.
The clerk looked at the passport picture and then at me, and then back at the picture and then again back at me. I gave her a nervous smile and tugged on my newly purchased red Nebraska football sweatshirt. I released my magic full force through my veins, knocking over a display a few feet away. I jumped, startled and realized if I didn’t get my magic under control, they were going to call the police. Who knew magic could get nervous?
“I hate that picture,” I cleared my throat and tried to sound confident. I attempted to send some magic her way again, but was afraid I would knock her over too if I didn’t relax.
“Hmmm….” she frowned suspiciously. “Do you have another form of ID on you?  A driver’s license or something?” she put the passport and ticket on the counter and tapped her fingers impatiently.
“Y-y-yes I think I do,” I stammered out, pretending to dig through my bag looking for it. My bag was not that deep, it was just a backpack and mostly empty since I had left all of my books in the car, but I needed to milk it for all it was worth.  
“Isn’t that your wallet?” she asked, as the item in question nearly fell from my hands. I gave her an irritated half-smile and handed it over. Once she saw not only the picture, but the name on it, this half-assed plan was over.
A creepy crawly feeling of irritation swept over me; I just wanted to get on that plane. I glanced over at the clerk and felt the same sense of irritation flood her, and that was when I realized I didn’t have to be smooth. I didn’t have to do what Avalon did. It was great that he could make other people feel safe and secure and smiley, but that was just not me right then. I was pissed, I was irritated and I was in a big freaking hurry. If nothing else, I could at least make her emote with me.
I released my magic a little too strongly and I saw the young clerk take a visible step backwards. I began to feel guilty for hurting the poor girl, but then she gave me a dirty look that reminded me a little too much of Seraphina. Suddenly she was looking at the clock and processing my airline ticket. She let out a huge huff of impatience, handing me my respective papers quickly.
“I assume you won’t be checking any bags?” she looked disdainfully at my worn out book bag.
“Nope,” I said, returning her irritation with a smile and breathing a sigh of relief.
She turned to the next passenger in line and I ran up the escalator. It could not have been that easy! Finally something was going my way. I didn’t slow down until I made it through security, to my terminal and onto the walkway.
A pretty flight attendant with perfect posture greeted me at the doorway to the plane. I handed over my ticket grateful for assistance and she pointed just inside the doorway to a luxurious first class seat next to a window. 
I sat down heavily and breathed another sigh of relief. I took a hair tie off of my wrist and knotted my hair into a messy bun on the top of my head. Per instructions of the flight attendant I stored my nearly empty backpack underneath my seat and buckled up for safety.
I looked out of my window at Omaha for one last time; I had never flown before, let alone overseas. I had no idea what to expect and less of an idea what to do when I got there. After my connecting flight in Atlanta I would be non-stop until Romania. The bright afternoon sunlight flooded my window and I relished in the warmth and security of self-righteousness. Lilly needed me and I refused to let her down.

----

I breathed in the smoke and smog that met me outside the dingy glass doors of the airport in Timisoara, Romania. The wide-lane street in front of me was full of small cabs in every color. Most of them were driven by middle-aged, olive-skinned Romanian men with mustaches and cigarettes. And all of the cars looked at least fifty years old.
I walked over to one of the parked Dacia’s, waiting to take me on the next leg of this exhausting adventure. I tugged at the oversized cruise wear I acquired at a gift shop in the Atlanta airport and realized that it was not nearly warm enough for the cold and dreary autumn of Romania.
“English?” I asked hopeful, to a gruff looking Romanian man wearing a worn out black leather jacket. He shook his head and grunted what I took to be an amused laugh.
I pulled out the English to Romanian dictionary I also purchased at the Atlanta airport and searched for the T section.
“Statie?” I stumbled through the word, using what I knew from my Spanish pronunciations to ask for the train station.
“Da, da. Timisoara?” he clarified our destination, since the airport was outside of the city a little ways.
“Da.” I repeated the Russian “yes”, most Romanians used.
He nodded his head towards the back seat and I climbed in. The springs underneath the well-worn upholstery dug into my sore legs. I yawned, but refused to close my eyes. Not that I necessarily trusted this stranger, nor did I know how long the ride would be exactly, but there was much too much to see as we made our way towards the western metropolis of Timisoara.
Communist block apartments rose on every side of me; the tall, simple, concrete buildings emoted a melancholy dismalness that was enforced by the incessant rainfall. Small corner shops and gypsy children begging for money lined the now narrowed streets as I held on for dear life. The driver swerved in and out of traffic more precariously than Avalon and not nearly as gracefully.
The olive skinned Romanians walked, or biked or took the tram, all with their heads down, minding their own business. In my Guide to Romania book I picked up along with my dictionary, I read that the Romanians fought their way out of Communism by a revolution started in this very city. What was once called the Paris of the East was only a shell of its former glory.
Timisoara was destroyed by Communism after World War II; the Communist dictatorship that enslaved the Romanian people raped them of any technological or artistic advancement. And although they were well on their way to recovery after a Revolution that had happened over twenty years ago, there was still an oppressiveness that settled on the country’s inhabitants.
I had yet to read anything in either of my books pertaining to an Immortal Citadel. In fact, the only folk lore of any kind related to vampires. I had no idea where I would end up or what to expect but for some reason entering Romania was like coming home. The desolate streets and war torn buildings held an eerie beauty I found captivating.
The cab slammed to a stop in front of an old building on the edge of a piazza or square. The driver tapped his finger on the meter, indicating the fare I owed him. I clumsily tried to count out the Lei, but in the end I threw a stack of bills at him, hoping he appreciated the tip.
I exchanged plenty of money in the airport, and was told that most places accepted my American credit card anyway. Hopefully, Aunt Syl wouldn’t be too upset with the credit card bill this month. Who was I kidding? If it wasn’t the bill that made her go ballistic, it would surely be my spur of the moment trip across an ocean to a third world country after I was specifically forbidden not to by more than one authority.
I shouldered my backpack once again; its weight had definitely increased throughout the trip, from old clothes to my new books, it was getting kind of heavy. I pulled the straps tight though, hoping to discourage any type of pickpocket and worked my way through the busy train station doors.
My travel guide had informed me that the Blue Arrow train was the only way to travel in style and I decided to take its word for it. I found the ticket counter without any problem, and pulled out my dictionary for the necessary terms. A stout, elderly woman who had seen better days sat behind a thick glass partition.
“Buna dimineata, doamna” I stuttered through, reading directly from a page marked Popular Phrases in my English to Romanian Dictionary. Good morning madam.
She grunted her reply, and I forged through another phrase.
“Un bilet la Sibiu va rog,” One ticket for Sibiu, please. I gave her my award winning smile and she simply grunted back what I assumed to be a number, but I had no idea really. She could have said anything; she probably called me a stupid American.
I held up a small handful of cash, unsure of what any of it meant. Unfortunately, Kingsley didn’t offer a monetary conversion class. Or maybe I just hadn’t been forced to take it yet.
She took my handful of Lei and counted out what she needed; even if she took a little more for herself it didn’t bother me. She passed me back the change along with a ticket and pointed in the direction of the platform, holding up her hand to signal five minutes.
“Multumesc,” I tried again, saying thank you before walking away quickly to the platform.
I found the train I was assigned to and it was thankfully the Blue Arrow. The only modern and smooth looking ride among a line of trains that looked like they could be the first model of a train…. ever. Breathing my one hundredth sigh of relief I walked through the automatic doors, passed seats filled with all different social classes of Romanian.
The train was slightly deceiving in that I expected luxury once inside the automatic doors, but instead was met with a pungent smell that nearly made me hurl. I politely covered my mouth pretending to cough and collapsed into my seat, just in time to hear the whistle and feel the earth begin to move slowly beneath my feet.
On the long plane ride over I had time to plan and plot. I had gone over my speech a thousand times, and I was determined to give it once inside the court room doors. The only problem was that I needed to be able to find the courtroom.
The town of Sibiu was located in the central part of Romania and in the mountains; this was as far as I knew to go. I only remembered the name of the town Kiran had given me after I recognized it in the guidebook.
The biggest problem was that the festival was for sure not in the city, and apparently somewhere in the middle of nowhere. The train would take me directly into the city, but once I was there, I would have no other direction to follow. I was still determined; although regretful I hadn’t pressured Avalon for more information.
The train left the city and wound through the breathtaking Romanian countryside. I refused to sleep during that part of my journey too and watched as the train flew by fields being farmed by old fashioned horses and wagons and primitive gypsy villages with naked children running about.
Eventually someone came by to take my ticket. The train employee laughed out loud at my white, sleeveless sweater tank top and ocean blue capris. If only he knew the clothing options I was given in the middle of an Atlanta airport while trying to catch my international flight, I thought he might have been proud of me.
After he continued on his way, I realized how ridiculous I looked. I hadn’t slept in two days; my long hair was greasy and knotted into an impossible mess on the top of my head. The cruise wear I purchased was obviously out of season, and then to top it off I was still wearing my school clogs. A cold shiver ran over my body and giving up completely I pulled out my bright red Nebraska Corn Huskers sweatshirt and threw it on over my tank top.
I remembered Avalon’s expensive black suit and tie and cringed to think how out of place I would look upon arrival at the Citadel…. if I could find it. By my calculations the trial would be late this evening, and I had only precious hours until my time was up and all of this would have been for nothing.
I hugged my worn out back pack as if it were my last hope for success. I couldn’t have come this far for nothing; I wouldn’t have come this far and do nothing.
“You’re one of them,” An elderly woman took a seat next to me and spoke perfect English. I sat up shocked to hear my own tongue and even more shocked by her words.
“Excuse me?” A wave of nervousness washed over me, and I searched out a current of magic in the old woman but sensed nothing.
“One of the Old Ones,” the woman smiled genially and revealed toothless gums. I did not know what to make of the woman who was clearly human and by the looks of things, a gypsy. She was dressed in layer upon layer of rags, her hair tied behind a dirty bandana. A large gold ring protruded from her nose, and larger golden rings dangled from her ears. Her hands were small and gnarled; the dirt under her nails prominent. Her eyes, a brilliant violet, were her only beautiful quality. They reminded me of Angelica.
“The Old Ones?” I asked, confident she meant Immortals, but unsure how she would know about us, or that I was one of them.
She reached out suddenly to grab my hands. Hers were warm and moist as they gripped mine firmly. I tentatively tried to pull them back, but her grasp was so tight and her gaze so intense I was honestly scared of her. I thought to offer her money, but she began to inspect my palms as if looking for something in particular.
“It can’t be,” she sighed softly taking my hands and holding them high above me towards the light.
“I’m sorry?” I pulled my hands away from her and tucked them under my arms, afraid of what she found. A chill worked its way up my spine.
“You are the next Oracle,” she spoke with such awe and her gaze searched my eyes so intently that I looked down, once again afraid of this tiny old woman.
“Do you know where they are? The Old Ones?” I found my nerves and asked bravely; although I was unsure why I would trust this stranger.
“Do you not?” she pinched my chin tightly between her thumb and forefinger, and then moved my head in a circle, inspecting it for who knew what.
“No, I am…. I am trying to find them,” I confided, still unsure if I could trust her.
“You are going to the mountain village?” she asked turning my head sharply in one direction and then letting out a loud giggle.
“Yes,” I said, hoping she meant Sibiu.
“Then follow the magic,” she suddenly stood up, then bent down and kissed my forehead with wet, sticky lips. I refrained from wiping off the slobber immediately. “They have waited for you for a long time.”
The train suddenly lurched to a stop, sending me sliding forward in my seat. I looked up, expecting the feeble, older woman to be sprawled on the floor since she was standing precariously during the sudden stop, but she was already at the doors and gone before I could even get out of my seat. After she was safely on the ground the train began again as if it was scheduled to make that very stop.


Chapter Thirty-Nine


The gypsy woman still a mystery, the train came to a stop in the humble, but beautiful town of Sibiu. I exited the train, backpack in tow, to an outdoor platform. I breathed in the less polluted air of the countryside and lifted my face to the late afternoon sun, whose warmth I barely felt. I pulled the hood up on my sweatshirt and took in another big breath.
It was during that breath, that I finally felt it; the small hum of magic coming from some distance away. It was almost like a calling; the buzzing electricity beckoned me to find it.
I took another big breath and let the distant call of magic fill me. I may not have known exactly where to go, but at least I had a general direction to follow.
I looked around for cab drivers, but the smaller town wasn’t as convenient as the booming Western city of Timisoara. In fact, the town looked nearly deserted. The tourist shops were all closed and the streets empty. I didn’t know how far the Citadel was from this small town, but it was too far to walk, the magic could at least assure me of that.  
I had no choice for now however, and began to jog in the direction of where I felt like the magic was located. The city was very hilly and I found myself walking up a very steep incline when I finally stumbled upon a cab driver taking a smoke and sitting on the hood of his run down Dacia.
“English?” I asked, not expecting much.
“Da. English,” he smiled, and I could see rows of gold teeth behind dirty lips.
“Can you drive me?” I pointed in the direction I wanted to go in.
“Not that way,” he shook his head rapidly and then spat on the ground.
“I will pay you,” I said clearly and pulled out my stack of Lei again.
“Not enough to go that way,” he looked back in the direction with an expression of fear.
“Please,” I said plainly and when he shook his head no again, I resorted to begging. “Please, please,” I cried out.
“Why do you want to go that way?” he asked with a thick accent.
“I have to save my friend,” I begged, helplessly. “Please.”
“I will not take you all the way, but I will get you close enough, da?” his expression was full of pity and I was so thankful that I rushed over and hugged the poor man. He spat his cigarette out and choked on the smoke, completely surprised by the affection.
Before he could recover I hopped into the back seat, a near replica of the first taxi I was in. I exhaled, but was unable to relax. Once the driver successfully started the stubborn car, my nerves only grew. I rehearsed again and again the case I intended to make for Lilly, my stomach turning into knots.
The cab drove out of the city and into the winding roads of the mountains. The countryside only became more beautiful; millions of trees in all different fall shades blanketed the horizon. Their loveliness stretched out across the rising hills and as the sun set lower in the sky, their reds and oranges melted into one extraordinary canvas of color.
The center of magic grew stronger and stronger the deeper we found our way into the lush forest; its call became more clarified. At this point I could have given directions to the driver, but he seemed perfectly able to find the way on his own. And as the magic intensified, the poor driver’s speed decreased. The pitiable man was clearly terrified of a force I would not have expected him to be aware of.
I watched him become more and more agitated, lighting thin cigarette after thin cigarette, never allowing his mouth to sit idle. I wondered what sparked his anxiety, unsure if he was even conscious of exactly what he was afraid of.
Whether it was his nervousness that rubbed off on me or my own sense of foreboding I couldn’t tell; but I did wonder if I shouldn’t be proceeding with a little more caution. I thought of my purpose again though and my determination was renewed.
Lilly, who had done nothing wrong, who fought to save the very Prince who condemned her. Lilly, sweet Lilly, who had never said a hurtful word about anyone and befriended me when no one else would. She wasn’t afraid of the consequences of her actions when she defended Kiran, why should I be?
As the sun took its lowest place on the horizon before it dipped below the never ending peaks and valleys, the driver finally slowed to a complete stop. He looked up towards the wilderness with mouth open, eyes wide, his cigarette hanging precariously from his lips.
“Multumesc,” I mumbled quickly and threw my remaining stack of Lei in the front seat. He didn’t respond to me, but as soon as the door was closed he performed a quick U-turn and sped off down the hill.
At this point the magic was so strong I knew I was only steps from the Citadel. Completely unsure what to expect next, I began my trek off the road and into the wooded wilderness. There was a steep hill I had to climb, I was hoping at the top I would be able to take in my surroundings a bit better.
  Time was of the essence, so I did my best to hurry. Thankful for my devotion to yoga and the sudden necessity of magic, I scaled the vertical incline. Despite the electricity rushing through my veins, and the flexibility yoga had blessed me with, I fell several times and began to sweat despite the coolness of the evening.
By the time I reached the top of the hill I was covered in dirt and my hair was soaked with sweat. I did, however, get a better perspective once I could see more of what was ahead of me. I saw the low glow of lights in the distance, they encompassed a valley a few hills away from mine. The lights stretched out in a square of sorts and I took this to be the Citadel. I also felt the magic swirling about, indicating a large gathering of Immortals.
For a moment I was seized with anxiety and doubt. I forced myself to breathe, reminding myself for the millionth time my purpose. I picked up my pace; running down the next hill and doing my best to hike quickly up the following one. I became more and more dirty and I smelled a distinct odor not at all pleasing.
Eventually, I stood above the Citadel on a surrounding hill. I paused for a moment to take in the sight. The Citadel was huge, nestled into a valley surrounded by camouflaging hills. It was bordered by walls as if it was once a fort, or still was a fort of some type. Buildings lined three of the inside walls, with more buildings built into the center. The fourth wall was left as a type of entrance, only with large doors that could be closed if needed.
The Citadel reminded me of some type of medieval village, with a castle positioned towards the back and clearly the most protected structure inside the walls. The spires of the castle wound towards the sky, each window lighted by a soft yellow glow. The streets of the city were littered with Immortals of every color and race. Several men stood at the entrance gates stopping people as they came or went.
I hiked down the hill and then around the Eastern wall to the gates. I took my time so that I could observe others enter through the wide doors, hoping to emulate their example. The Guards at the gate reminded me of Talbott and had a strict, military way about them. I noticed that they also carried both a gun and a sword attached at their belts.  The people entering the gates were all stopped and asked to give their first and last name. They were then asked to hold out their palms so that the guards could grasp their hands firmly. The people were all clearly Immortal, I had no trouble reading that off of them, and it made me wonder if the guards were searching for something else.
I noticed one other fact about the people entering the gate, making my nerves skyrocket once again. All of the people, without exception were very well dressed. The women wore expensive ball gowns and the men were dressed in full tuxedos. Hair done, makeup done, expensive shoes, couture jewelry, it didn’t matter, these people went all out.
I looked down at my pathetic shambles of clothing and took a sniff under my armpit; not pretty. I paused for a final moment to stop and reassemble my hair which was nearly impossible to unhinge from the hair tie. Eventually I succeeded, but not having a mirror around, I suspected I might have done more damage than good. I smoothed out my Nebraska hoodie and took a confident step forward. I’d made it this far….
“Name,” a gruff Guard demanded when it was my turn. I could feel more than hear the Guards’ confusion with my appearance.
“Eden Matthews,” I said clearly.
The Guard looked over his list, and then over it again, clearly not finding my name. I hadn’t realized there would be a guest list. The Guard looked me over skeptically at first, but then his expression turned to disgust and for a moment I thought I might be in trouble.
“Give me your hand,” he grunted menacingly.
I obeyed, sticking out my palm and allowing him to grip it firmly between his.
“Your name’s not on the list. Who are your parents? And why do you look like that?” two other Guards walked over to listen to my explanation.
“I go to school at Kingsley,” I started to explain, realizing I knew nothing about this people group I belonged to. “I came with Seraphina Van Curen, we go to school together. My parents couldn’t come, they’re on business in India,” lies tumbled out of my mouth built from random pieces of overheard information, and I forced my magic into submission, refusing to let it give me away. “I just went for a hike, but I am going to shower and change before I attend the feast tonight,” I offered a wide smile, but then closed my lips quickly afraid of what my breath smelt like after not brushing my teeth since the airline bathroom.
“With Ms. Van Curen?” The guard asked skeptically. I nodded my head affirmatively and pushed a little magic his way, hoping he didn’t notice. I knew it worked on humans, but I had no idea what the outcome would be on another Immortal.
“Please I would really like to be ready on time,” I stared past the Guards as if I knew exactly where I was going once inside the gates.
“They just started the trial; you’ll have plenty of time before the feast,” the Guards made a path for me to fit through and the first Guard nodded his head for me to pass.
I rushed past them and into the narrow streets of the Citadel. If they had already started the trial, I didn’t have much time. From the top of the hill I was able to see exactly where I had needed to go; but from the streets below I could not have been more lost. I moved in the direction of where I thought the castle was and let my magic lead the way.
I put all of my hope in the castle ahead of me. I didn’t know for sure where the trial would be held, but logic encouraged me to examine the castle first. I sprinted full force through the mobs of people lingering about in the streets. My sole purpose was to get to that trial before a verdict was given.
Out of breath and out of willpower, I stumbled into a square by chance. Tall edifices surrounded a cobblestone piazza with an enormous fountain in the middle. The square was lit up with a thousand lanterns strung together and hanging from the buildings surrounding the fountain. Musicians played Beethoven and I glanced over expecting to see an orchestra, but was surprised by the eight or so Immortals that made up an intricate string ensemble.
With renewed vigor I took the remaining distance in strides and ran through the open castle doors. The floors of the castle were marble and I was suddenly sliding across the lobby trying to stop. Another Guard looked up at me from his post just inside the doors.
“Trial?” I asked, breathless and unable to slow down for a minute to listen.
“Through those doors,” he pointed to a set of brass double doors that were almost an exact match for the ones at Kingsley. “But you can’t go in there like that,” he glared disdainfully at my red sweatshirt and I realized that he was probably right.
“Bathroom?” I patted my backpack like it had the answer to my disturbing appearance.
He pointed to a door positioned behind him and I rushed past. The bathroom was surprisingly modern, despite the old world appearance of the place. I didn’t have time to take a good look however and I got straight to business.
I headed directly to the sink and mirror and was almost horrified to see the image staring back at me. My face was caked in mud and dirt and my hair was a big pile of tangles. My mascara and eyeliner had dripped down my face. I looked like a dirty raccoon. My clothing was completely ruined, not to mention the fact that it didn’t match to begin with. I could only do so much and decided to focus on my face.
I turned the cold water on and splashed my face, scrubbing it roughly. Once it was clean, or at least clear of mud and makeup, I focused on my hair. I ripped the pony tail holder out and did my best to comb through the tangled mess with my fingers. Thankfully it was greasy enough that my frizz was actually more tamed than usual. I decided to leave it down, hoping the length and color would disguise the bright redness of my ridiculous sweatshirt that under normal circumstances I would have been proud to wear.
I finished quickly and turned to face the door. I decided the quickest route into the courtroom and then took one final breath before throwing the bathroom door open, sprinting through the lobby and bursting through the double brass doors.
“Lilly Mason is innocent!” I yelled at the top of my lungs, adrenaline and nerves getting the best of me.


Chapter Forty


The courtroom was silent, all eyes turned towards me; mouths fell open, a pin drop could be heard. After my outburst, I found myself speechless; I was disoriented. This was not at all what I had expected.
I took in the unexpected sight quickly, unsure what to make of my surroundings. I didn’t know what I thought I would find, but the courtroom looked more like a cathedral than a place for judge and jury. The ceiling was vaulted all the way to the top of the castle spire; large stained glass windows extended two of the walls with elaborate and colorful designs reaching from floor to ceiling. The other wall, not containing the entrance doors was made of stone and practically bare, except for a large tapestry hanging in the center.
At the front of the room was a large imposing throne, at least twenty feet tall and made of what looked to be solid gold. An extremely good looking man of maybe thirty, sat straight edged, staring at me; his crown of more gold was slightly cockeyed on his head. The crown adorned with rubies and emeralds glistened on top of short golden locks, and matched his closely cropped goatee.
I stood there staring at him, wondering if I should bow or curtsy or continue with my testimony. He was obviously the King; unfortunately, I couldn’t remember anything I had practiced to say. He jumped up suddenly and I took a step back; his simple gesture frightened me. He wore a long crimson robe and swept it back as he moved to stand. The entire room of people sat silently, waiting for him to say something.
My eyes finally fell on Lilly who was positioned in the middle of the room, surrounded by rows and rows of people forming a type of octagon around her. She was wearing a simple black robe with a hood, and her vibrant red hair stood out in stark contrast. She was boxed in on every side by what looked like a witness box, sitting on a stool in the middle. Our eyes met for only a second, but the gratitude she relayed to me in those brief moments made my entire trip worth it.
“Excuse me,” Kiran’s familiar voice nearly shouted his apology and all at once he moved from his place next to his father and towards me.
I looked back over at the King, whose expression I couldn’t read; something like anger, or surprise or a mixture of the two, but then there was something much deeper in his eyes. Kiran practically ran to me from his throne that was barely a smaller version of his father’s. He too was wearing a golden crown adorned with colorful jewels and sitting crooked on his head. His longer locks, a little unruly underneath, gave him an almost wild appearance, but one I was infinitely attracted to.
“What are you doing here?” he whispered fiercely in my ear. He grabbed my arms firmly in his and shoved me forward to the base of the throne. “Curtsy,” he whispered again even harsher and half pushed me into the position. I was confused enough not to fight him, although this was not exactly what I had planned. “Excuse us,” he said loudly again, only this time he addressed the entire courtroom.
He turned to walk purposefully past the rows of people and through a side door, dragging me along with him. I tried to fight him off my arms, after all, I hadn’t finished my testimony, but his grip was so tight I realized there was no use. Once we were through the wide brass door, he threw me out of his arms roughly. I struggled to regain my balance and when I finally was able to stand strongly I turned directly to give him a piece of my mind.
“Don’t even start with me!” he spoke softly, but his voice was full of venom. “I told you not to come, I ordered you not to come. What the hell are you doing here?” he began to pace frantically, glancing at the door every several seconds.
“Somebody had to stand up for Lilly!” I felt like shouting, but I used the volume example he set instead, although I filled my voice with as much irritation as I could muster.
“Well you did that, didn’t you? And made a fool of yourself! And now you’ll probably be sentenced to a worse fate than she would ever have been! How could you be so reckless?” he continued to pace, and glance at the door, but eventually he added a nervous glance in my direction. His eyes were filled with fear and anxiety and the way he looked at me made my anger melt away despite the verbal lashing I was receiving.
“All because of a stupid interruption?” I asked, finally taking the situation seriously.
“Because of who your parents are and because you look exactly like your bloody mother!” he finally stopped pacing and walked over to me, bringing me into his arms. I let him, confused once again, but comforted by his affection.
The door opened and he pulled me tighter into him, shielding me from the intruder. I could feel him hold his breath and when I looked up at him his eyes were shut tight, but as soon as the door closed and it was clear the only person that entered the room was Amory, he relaxed and exhaled. I was so confused by his behavior; I had no idea what to feel.
“What are you doing here?” Amory whispered, clearly enraged. “It doesn’t even matter now. What are you going to do with her?” he turned his attention to Kiran, practically pleading with him.
“I can’t….” Kiran’s voice broke and I heard the emotion in his voice. Tears came to my eyes as my emotions were so tied up in his, I couldn’t bear to see him so upset. “You have to take her; you have to get her the hell out of here. You have to save her, Amory,” Amory stared, wide eyed and clearly in shock at Kiran’s demands. “You can’t let him take her. Please…. I can’t lose her,” his voice broke again and I saw that his eyes were full of tears.
“I don’t know what to…. I won’t. I won’t let him anywhere near her,” Amory’s confusion disappeared and I watched him mentally set his mind to a plan.
“Do whatever Amory says, Eden,” Kiran turned his attention back to me, gazing into my eyes and hugging my tighter. “You have to get as far away from here as possible.”
“No,” I said simply, unwilling to be as melodramatic as these two.
“Don’t you understand what he will do to you if he finds out who you really are? He is most likely already suspicious, you look just like her,” Kiran pulled me closer still, pressing my head against his chest. He rested his chin on the top of my forehead. I wondered at the “he” they referred to.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” I said softly, but firmly. “There is no way I am leaving Lilly! Do you know what I went through to get here?”
“I don’t care what you went through!” he pushed me away with his arms to look me in the face; but his hands never left my body. “He will kill you, Eden, do you understand that?” Kiran whispered fiercely to me, and I was physically taken aback. I looked over at Amory hoping for answers, but he simply nodded in agreement with Kiran.
“Then you save her,” I demanded, glaring at Kiran, firm in my solution.
“You can’t be serious! I will be lucky if I can explain you away. My father will never allow that!” his accent was thick and crisp and every bit of irritation and frustration was evident in it.
“I am completely serious. If you can’t protect Lilly, then I will stay and fight for her myself,” I struggled from his grasp and folded my arms stubbornly.
“No, you will absolutely not,” Kiran crossed his arms in an equally defiant pose.
A knock on the door leading to the courtroom startled Kiran and he once again took a defensive pose in front of me. Amory opened the door just enough to reveal a beautiful woman with long, dark auburn hair, adorned by a dainty golden crown. I watched as Kiran stiffened in front of me and I felt the surge of magic that flared beneath his skin.
“I’m sorry for the interruption,” the woman began, “But your father has requested that you join us once again,” she smiled congenially at him, never looking beyond him. Her eyes stared at the floor just before his feet.
“I’ll be there in a moment mother,” Kiran responded softly.
“Is that her?” the woman’s voice was strained and almost too soft to hear.
“Of course not.” Kiran’s voice was masked by cheerfulness but he took another step backwards in my direction, shielding me further from sight.
The woman’s eyes flickered once in my direction before she quietly shut the door and we were once again alone. Amory opened a wooden door parallel to the door leading to the courtroom and I saw that it led to a dim hallway. The floors and walls were made of the same stone as the courtroom.
“Take her to my room,” Kiran announced loudly and suddenly.
Amory began to pull me out of the room, and I understood that Kiran’s demand was only for show. Wherever Amory planned to take me would most likely not be Kiran's bedroom. I fought Amory, but only weakly, I knew I had no choice in the matter.
“Please, Kiran,” I begged. “Please save her.” Tears welled in my eyes and I wasn’t for sure if they were for Lilly or Kiran.
He let out a soft grunt of frustration, but I could see that his eyes were resigned. He would help her. He put his hand on the door handle opposite ours, but turned around quickly as if he forgot something. He took the length of the room in two long strides and suddenly I was wrapped in his arms and his lips were against mine.
Kiran pressed his mouth on mine desperately. He dipped me back so that I was fully in his embrace. I gave up all fight and let his lips melt into mine. Our magic mingled together in a fervent, passionate, overwhelming force that left me breathless and wild. His hand grasped at my hair, tangling his fist into my dark locks.
When he finally released me, the emotion in his face was indefinable but I understood it since it was the emotion mirrored in mine. He pushed me out of the room towards Amory and I found myself swept up in Amory’s tight grasp as I fought to return to him.
“Promise me nothing will happen to her,” Kiran commanded Amory, and when Amory hesitated out of confusion, Kiran demanded louder, “Promise me!”
“I promise,” Amory whispered quietly and with steady resolve.
Then the door was closed and I was running down a dark hallway, Amory practically pushing me to move faster. I was done asking questions. Nothing made sense; nothing was ever explained to me. For now I would do as I was told because Kiran asked me to, but there would come a time very, very soon when I would get my answers.
I glanced over my shoulder at the closed door and the room that only seconds ago housed the most intimate moment Kiran and I had ever shared. As I ran blindly in the dark, my feelings for Kiran were finally clarified. I loved him, with every breath I had, with all of my soul, I loved him. And I would do anything it took to be with him.


Chapter Forty-One


“Through here,” Amory ordered, pushing me through another darkened passageway.
We had been running through the bowels of the castle for at least twenty minutes. Amory seemed to know exactly where he was going and I tried to trust him, but remained skeptical. I was once again a sweaty mess and wished we could stop for a moment so I could remove my sweatshirt. My hair flew wildly about me, sticking to the perspiration running down my face.
“Where are we going?” I asked, out of breath, stumbling a little in the dark.
“As far from here as possible,” he responded, pushing me forward with his hands. “And through here,” he suddenly turned right and took the lead. I struggled to keep up with him.
The passageway was dark and narrow, there was barely enough room for us to face forward between the cool stone walls. At one point we had taken stairs leading downwards, so I assumed we were somewhere underneath the castle. I was still unsure why we had to make this escape, but as long as Kiran kept his promise, I would keep mine and follow Amory without question.
“Stop,” Amory whispered fiercely, pressing his body against the wall and thrust out his arm, forcing me to do the same.
We were quiet, both afraid of the unknown. The only sound I could hear was my own frantic breathing; I wiped the sweat from my brow, pushing my long hair behind my ears. Amory also breathed heavily, but I had been surprised at his level of fitness. He was awfully spry for someone of his age.
“Eden,” he said softly, but gravely. “I need you to turn off your magic completely. I need you to repress it like you did before you knew what it was. Hold your magic in until we are safe. Can you do that?” he turned his head to give me a serious stare and I nodded my reply.
I pushed the magic down, making it dissolve completely from my veins. I was suddenly tired and sluggish. I hadn’t realized how much the magic had kept me going; but after several days of no sleep and extenuating travel circumstances, any normal human would have been delirious by now.
At our stilled position and with our backs pushed heavily against the cool stone, the exhaustion began to take over. My knees became weak and without my permission my body started to slide down the rock wall towards the uneven floor. Amory pulled my exhausted body back into a standing position by the arm and shook me roughly.  
“We have to keep going. Will you make it?” he asked, forcing me to look into his eyes by gripping the sides of my head firmly.
“I can make it,” I mumbled weakly, not sure if it was possible, but determined to try. I shook my head feebly, trying to wake myself up.
“Think of Lilly,” Amory coaxed, “Think of Kiran,” he finally had my attention and I brought my body into a strong standing position.
“Let’s go,” I said with more energy.
Amory grabbed my wrist and pulled me along behind him. We ran, half stumbled in the darkness through the cool corridors. I never heard another footstep or sound other than ours, but I had no doubt that we were being hunted. I kept up with Amory the best I could; with my magic gone, normal, human adrenaline was forced to take over.
Suddenly we were faced with a dead end. The hallway had narrowed considerably and then came to a point where the two parallel walls met. I wondered what we were going to do now.
Amory let go of my wrist and I fell hard against the cool stone. I could barely keep my eyes open, but curiosity gave me a few more moments of consciousness.
Amory felt the point of the wall, letting his hands fall over every stone and every crevice. He started at the top of the wall and worked his way down to the floor, quickly and efficiently. He pushed firmly on random rocks, as if looking for one in particular.
Finally, he let out a small grunt of approval, and I watched his fingers disappear in what seemed to be the middle of the floor. He braced his body and then grunted louder removing a large block of stone from the floor and revealing a ladder leading further under the castle.
I forced my body away from the wall and began to descend the ladder without any instruction needed. Obviously this was our only option. I heard water beneath me, but was blinded by complete darkness descending slowly into the black abyss. I could still see Amory’s face as I took the shaky ladder, rung by rung, deep into the blackness.
After I was far enough down the ladder for Amory to follow, he stood on one of the top rungs and slid the rock floor back into place. I saw a type of handle underneath the faux floor that made it easy to be returned home. Once the floor was in place we were completely in the dark and I was nearly paralyzed by fear of the unknown.
The ladder hung precariously from the ceiling of the cavernous hole and swayed back and forth with our body weight. Every move, every step, every breath we took evoked a rusty creaking sound that had me seizing up in fear. I forced my appendages to move and forbade my mind to consider the possibilities of this ladder crashing to the black chasm beneath us.
The sound of water grew stronger the lower we climbed, and I made the assumption of a creek or brook flowing through wherever we were headed. My eyes began to adjust to the blackness, but it was too dark to make anything out for sure. I wondered if Amory was using magic or if he repressed his as well.
Eventually my foot found the ground in an awkward step that made my knee give out. I didn’t catch myself in time and fell to the solid ground in an uncomfortable heap. 
Once on solid ground, I pushed myself up to my hands and knees and felt through the dirt as I crawled forward or at least in a forward direction until the ground ended and another stone wall ascended in its place.
I gripped the wall, using it to pull my body up into a standing position again. Wherever we were now was clearly far beneath ground because the temperature had dropped drastically. The water source was definitely a running stream of some type because I could hear the water moving purposefully. The air was clean and clear and I took a big breath in, happy for the moment to rest.
I heard Amory’s feet reach the solid ground and the ladder ceased from creaking. I listened for his footsteps to move in a direction, but I heard only the sound of the water. I was afraid to call out to him, since he had yet to speak a word.
I heard a scraping sound and my heart jumped, but when sparks flew through the darkness I realized Amory had only lit a match. A small flame burned alone until Amory used it to ignite a larger torch. The darkness was illuminated and I finally made out my surroundings.
We were in a type of cavern, with rock walls on every side. A single river ran through the middle at a quick pace. The surface we stood on was wide, and the ladder leading to the castle above was positioned closer to the stone wall than the river and its dangerous current. I pressed my cheek against the cold stone one more time before joining Amory at the river’s edge.
There was about a ten foot drop from the dirt surface to the rushing river below. I saw another rusted ladder built into the earth leading directly down into the water, with a small row boat tied to the orange metal. Two sets of oars lay on the bottom of the boat and a lantern was positioned at its stern. I looked at Amory with controlled fear, and he stared back with the same trepidation.
“Eden, we have to row upstream. It is very difficult, I won’t lie to you. But if we follow the current it will take us straight back to the Citadel. We have to row against it, do you understand? I am not sure if you will make it,” he was honest with me, and I saw the pain in his eyes through the flickering light of the torch.
“How far?” I asked, afraid he was right.
“At least two hours in the water, and then another three and a half hour hike after that. Can you repress your magic that long?” his eyes lost their pain and became determined. We both knew there was no other option.
“Yes,” I said simply, I had no other choice.
“I can’t do it alone. You will have to help me row,” I nodded with determination and took off my Nebraska Sweatshirt stuffing it into my backpack, and then tossed it into the rowboat.
Amory rolled up the sleeves of his suit shirt, and I realized that he used his suit jacket as the kindle for our torch. Amory handed me the torch and lowered himself over the edge and onto the ladder. He pulled the boat towards him with his long leg and then slowly took his steps onto the bow. Using the ladder for balance the entire time, he was eventually able to take a seat on one of the small boat’s two benches.
I lay down on the dirt floor and lowered the torch to Amory who had to stand precariously to reach it. Once it was in his grip he lit the lantern at the bow and put the torch flame out by dunking it in water. Instead of discarding the burned jacket in the river, he brought it back into the boat and set it at his feet. The wet clothing left a puddle of water at the bottom of an already damp floor.
Once Amory was able to give me his full attention, I swung my legs over the edge and found the ladder with my feet. I began my descent carefully, if not a little shakily. Eventually my feet ran out of rungs and my toe swept the river, flooding my navy blue clogs with ice cold water. I stretched my leg behind me until my toe bumped against the solid wood of the row boat and I used the force of my leg muscles to pull the boat closer to the edge of the dirt wall.
Gripping the lower rungs tightly with my trembling fingers, I placed one foot and then the other firmly on the bow of the row boat. I used my stomach muscles this time to pull the drifting boat closer still and took a step off of the bow and on to the wet, slippery floor. Sliding precariously, I let go of the ladder rungs and fell heavily onto the bench.
Satisfied with a somewhat safe landing, I gripped the sides of the boat tightly as it rocked roughly back and forth. I was positioned on the first bench near the front of the boat, with Amory behind me. He handed me my oars and I slid them through the paddle holes, so that I would not lose them. Their cold wood was wet and slippery. I regretted taking off my sweatshirt as the river water splashed over the sides of the boat and sprayed my bare arms and face.
“Are you ready?” Amory asked gravely. I took a quick moment to throw my hair onto the top of my head, securing it with my hair tie. I then gripped the oars, braced my body and nodded in agreement. “Start rowing now, and once I release the rope I will fall into a pattern with you,” I nodded again and took a big breath. “Eden….” Amory paused, “however hard this may be, we have no choice but to succeed,” his words held such gravity that I could not even respond.
I focused what little strength I had left and began to sink my oars deep beneath the turbulent surface of the river. I brought them high above the water and then deep beneath over and over again, fighting the strong current, determined to win.
I heard Amory struggle with the knot and then felt the quick release of the boat. At first we were taken violently downstream, and I forced my weak fingers to hold onto the oars. Amory joined my struggle and eventually we fell into a labored routine; the oars dipping under and over the water simultaneously.
I began to see progress as we forced our bodies to do the impossible. The cavern shrunk to only a rounded tunnel where the water was allowed to flow through. As we left the large grotto and began our journey against the current and through the narrow channel, I felt a glimmer of hope. No matter how difficult this flight may be, something deep inside warned me that it was necessary.  
I glanced back at Amory Saint working with all of his strength to propel us forward. His face was set and his eyes were hard with determination. I may not have any idea what we were running from, but whatever it was, had scared the hell out of him. 


Chapter Forty-Two


Amory and I rowed through the dark silently; the only sound in the narrow tunnel was our oars dipping in and out of the strong current and the rush of water against the stone walls. My body was shaking violently from weakness and my arms did their best to move us forward. I braced my body on the small wooden bench, using every muscle I had to row.
The lantern at the stern of the boat, the only light piercing the heavy darkness, cast eerie shadows on the rounded walls. Amory had clearly taken this exit before, but I was too exhausted to garner any details. I had no sense of time, and felt barely coherent.
Amory said we would row for two hours, he did not say we would be rowing in a dark and claustrophobic tunnel of death for two hours. I wished I was wearing a watch, because I was too afraid to ask Amory how much longer. Any extra effort, including talking and I was sure that would finally be it for me. I had never known such exhaustion in my entire life and I was positive I never wanted to know the feeling again.
The river’s current stayed quick and I never noticed a change in depth, although there might have been one; it was impossible to tell without testing it for myself. My feet were freezing from the ice cold water that made its way over the side and I stopped feeling my fingers a long time ago. They maintained their grasp on the oars however, as if obeying a command I forgot I gave them.
Amory grunted suddenly with the effort of another oar stroke. The sound echoed off of the low ceiling and close walls making me jump. My heart beat wildly, and my already labored breath quickened. Normally easily scared, I was actually grateful my heart was strong enough to still have a reaction.
“Sorry,” Amory panted and I heard the strained tone in his voice as our oars once again disappeared beneath the rough surface of the water.
I shook my head as if to say it was ok, but couldn’t force words out of my mouth. I pushed the oars under the rushing ripples and fought with everything I had to push them against the pressure of a force much greater than myself. The river fought back, convincing me to let my oar fall easily into its grip and float away. One more stroke, I decided; and then again, just one more stroke.
My eyes were focused on the dim circle of light the lantern illuminated; I could only see maybe ten or so feet in front of me. I centered on what I could to ensure the boat maintained a straight path, although something told me that Amory could have made the entire journey blinded.
A cool rush of air wrapped itself around me and I shuddered violently. Already frozen from the ice cold water, I dreaded the idea of a draft. When another gush of air rushed by me again, I began to hope. Maybe it was not a draft but the wind.
And then finally, the darkness softened around me into the midnight sky and a thousand stars twinkled above my head. The night air was frigid, whipping violently through the trees. The river widened once outside of the cave taking two paths, one through the black tunnel and the other around it. We were at the bottom of a valley, with hills rising on either side.
“Row over to the left bank,” Amory grunted. I obeyed, grateful to be finished with that part of the journey.
Once near the river’s edge, Amory jumped over the side quickly, knee deep in the rough current. He pushed the row boat up the side of the bank and tied the rope to a nearby tree.
When finally the boat was secured, he returned to my side and offered his hand to help me out. I pried my overworked fingers from the oars and placed a shaking hand in his. I stood up weakly, and allowed Amory to sustain most of my weight, nearly tumbling over the edge.
My feet landed in three feet of water, the violent current still rushing wildly around my shins, doing its best to knock me over. Amory braced me against his body and continued his support until we were safely on solid ground.
I collapsed onto the river bank, thankful to be out of the boat. I still felt the strange sensation of the movement of water and clutched the cool grass to steady myself. The ground was rough, and littered with sticks and rocks. They punctured and scraped my skin, but I was too exhausted to care.
Amory walked back to the boat once again to retrieve my backpack. He took the liberty of digging my sweatshirt out of the wet pack and tossing it to me. I made no movement for it, unable to find the strength to sit up.
“We still have a ways to go,” Amory’s voice was tired but determined. I opened my eyes to look at him, hoping I could form words but nothing came. His eyes deepened with anxiety while he looked around suspiciously.
“I can make it,” I finally mumbled. I pulled myself into a sitting position and found the strength to put my sweatshirt on. Although my backpack was wet from sitting at the bottom of the boat, my sweatshirt remained mostly dry.
Once the warmth of my Huskers sweatshirt was wrapped around me, I began to feel better. I pulled the hood up and tied the draw strings tight. Eventually I found the energy to stand up and shoulder my backpack again.
“Let me carry that,” Amory offered, referring to my bag.
“It’s alright, I can carry it for now,” I waved him off and then shook both of my feet consecutively. My shoes were full of water, and my toes ached from the cold.
Suddenly a jolt of electricity surged through my blood. I jumped, startled by the sudden burst of energy. My blood heated into a boil and my exhausted trembles turned into tremors of nervous energy. I did my best to dispel the unwanted magic, but it stayed persistent.
“They’re here,” Amory whispered. I realized the mysterious burst of magic was a warning sign that another Immortal was close. I followed Amory’s example and hunched over, crawling silently up the vertical incline.
He gestured with his hand to keep moving. I stayed as low to the ground as I could without actually crawling and stepped carefully. I was embarrassed by how clumsy I was as only human. I repressed my magic, although the temptation to use just a little bit was strong.
Just like at Kingsley when the other students’ magic would trigger my own, so this unfamiliar stranger had shot off a warning sign through my veins. I couldn’t help but be thankful however, as the hot blood had not only warmed my body, but given me an extra burst of energy making it possible to escape quickly now.
“As long as we stay human, I doubt they will be able to follow us. Stay close and stay quiet,” Amory instructed in a soft whisper. I struggled to hear through the whipping wind and rustling trees.
We continued our trek through the Romanian wilderness. The wind was strong and with every current of air the autumn leaves were carried off in all directions. Despite the chilliness of the night, the sky was clear and the moon shone bright.
Amory led the way up one steep slope and down another, over and over again. We may not have been hiking entire mountains, but these foothills might as well have been. My arms were exhausted from rowing, but finally able to rest. It was now my legs turn to bear the weight of our escape.
The nervous buzzing of unfamiliar magic began to dissipate and I noticed Amory relax a little. He slowed our pace somewhat, taking his time and treading carefully through the more dangerous inclines. Never once did he look up to consult our direction, he seemed to take every step confidently, as if the path we walked had been traveled many times before.
Through our seemingly endless expedition my thoughts drifted to Kiran. My lips burned with the memory of his farewell; the frantic, determination in which he pressed his mouth against mine made me push through the pain and exhaustion. I remembered his aqua eyes deep and searching, begging me to run.
A shudder slithered down my spine, totally unrelated to the cold night. Whatever the reason I was running, Kiran was convinced it was absolutely necessary.  I watched Amory take determined step after determined step and wondered at his reason for flight. What was it that had these two men so scared, so ready to risk everything to remove me from some mysterious danger?

----

“Here,” Amory panted, bending over to rest his hands on his knees. “We can rest here,” he struggled to catch his breath, while stabilizing himself.
I let out an exhausted sigh and sunk to the ground. The dirt and mud and damp ground had never offered such a comfortable resting place. I pulled my knees to my chest and rested my head wearily on them.
I licked my dry lips, realizing how thirsty I was. I thought back to the rushing river almost with regret. I shook my head quickly to rid my mind of the thought. I would survive.
“You can use your magic again,” Amory said with a stronger voice and I saw him stand upright confidently. “Careful though.”
The small buzzing of frenetic energy made its way over my body and I realized that Amory was bringing his back. He turned away from me and stretched out his arm. The buzzing grew stronger and Amory turned to shield his face.
A great white light followed by the sound of a tree exploding pierced the darkness and I let out a startled scream. I couldn’t help but be relieved however, that I was not the only one with those kinds of issues. Apparently blowing things up was just what happened to those pretending to be human.
I followed Amory’s example, allowing the buzzing to grow into a steady current of excited energy. I didn’t bother to stand up, but rather positioned my hands as far away from my face as I could. The energy continued to build and build until I could no longer hold it in anymore.
The small sapling that took the brunt of my built up electricity exploded into a thousand tiny pieces. I covered my head with my arms as small splinters rained down on top of me. When they stopped, I took a big breath relishing in the renewed energy.
Although my exhaustion did not completely disappear I was able to begin the healing process. As the magic moved through my blood, my muscles could finally relax. My scrapes and bruises began to disappear along with the soreness in my muscles. I rolled my head in a circle, cracking my neck and then stretched my arms high above my head. I felt completely renewed.
“Better?” Amory smiled at me.
“Much,” I smiled back.
“I don’t know many other Immortals who could have pulled that off. In fact, I’ve only heard of two others besides myself that have pulled that off,” Amory sat down beside me, resting his long arms on top of his bent knees.
“Oh really? Most Immortals can’t do that?” I felt oddly proud of my accomplishment.
“Oh, no. Most Immortals are useless without their magic. You are very special, child,” I blushed at his compliment.
“Who are the other Immortals then, I mean the ones who’ve done this before?” I asked, curious.
“You’re parents,” he said simply.
“Amory, I need answers,” I demanded at the reference to my parents. Although I was thankful to be that much more like them, I was tired of feeling in the dark.
“And you will get them, but first we need to call your brother. Your journey is far from over,” He looked out into the dark expanse with a distant expression on his face. I was not entirely sure if he meant my current journey or if he was speaking metaphorically. “Now that you have your magic back, I need you to connect with Avalon; he needs to come pick you up,” he gave me a look that told me I needed to follow his orders immediately.
Avalon. I concentrated on my twin brother, filling my body with strong energy. Avalon.
What? I knew immediately that he was irritated by my interruption. I felt defensive until I realized he didn’t even know we were in the same country.
We need your help. Now that our minds were connected, I felt every emotion, every thought he had, and I knew he felt the same with me. It was a very invasive experience.
Who’s we? His thoughts were tight and constrained, much like the position his body was in.
Amory and I. We need you. 
What? Amory? Where are you? The surprise in his thoughts was evident. He stopped moving completely to focus on our conversation.
Somewhere in the Romanian mountains. I’m not sure exactly, but we need you to come pick us up. I kept my mental tone light and I laughed a little when I realized that I was driving Avalon crazy. He was completely focused on his extraction mission, which he happened to be currently in the middle of. A pang of guilt hit me though and I was suddenly worried about Lilly and the team.
Can’t it wait? I’m kind of in the middle of something. Although I could feel his irritation, I could also sense his concern for us. He would have easily given up the mission to come to our aid.
“He’s in the middle of the mission. Can we wait until he’s finished?” I explained to Amory out loud.
“No, we need to get you out of the country immediately. Tell him to bring Jericho and two cars. Ryder’s team can finish the mission,” Amory was stern and commanding.
Amory says to let Ryder take over the mission and come now. He says to bring Jericho and two cars. And he says I have to get out of the country immediately. I was embarrassed to admit the last part.
What are you even doing here? Fine. Where are you? I felt his body turn in the opposite direction then he was originally headed and signal to Jericho. Whatever he was in the middle of he had dropped it instantaneously to follow Amory’s orders.
“Where are we?” I asked Amory in order to relay it to Avalon.
“He can follow your magic,” Amory said without giving any more details.
Follow my magic. I relayed to Avalon and felt him internally irritated, but he didn't ask any more questions.
“I want answers,” I demanded of Amory again when I could sense Avalon on his way.
“I will answer any question you ask,” Amory continued to stare off into the distance. I folded my arms stubbornly and opened my mouth. He’s damn right he would answer any question I had.


Chapter Forty-Three


“Ok, first of all, I’m glad we survived and all, but why on earth was that necessary?” I vented.
“You’re survival is absolutely essential,” Amory was quick to respond. “I’m afraid this war can’t be won without you and your brother,” Amory said firmly, although without actually answering my question.
“Yeah, I know; at least I’ve heard that before. But the question I am asking is why was my survival in question to begin with?” I turned to face Amory full on. I needed answers.
“Well that answer is a little more complicated. The short answer is because you look exactly like your mother; I’m sure you’ve also heard that before,” Amory paused for only a moment; just long enough for me to give him an encouraging look. “The long answer is because your mother happened to be engaged to Lucan before she ran off and eloped with your father, Lucan’s personal bodyguard. He would like nothing more than to find your mother and make her pay for a lifetime of sins.”
My mouth dropped open in surprise. That wasn’t exactly the answer I had been expecting. A million questions began to swirl around in my mind, but Amory, sensing my confusion, continued with his chronicle.
“Let’s see, I suppose I should start from the beginning. Lucan became King at a very young age because his father, Cedric, died suddenly from the King’s Curse. At that time Kings usually waited until they were 100 or so to choose a wife; Cedric had done exactly that, fathered a son and planned on living a long life. When he died, Lucan was only a teenager. His advisors tried to guide him, but he has always been stubborn. His personal body guard was a teenager as well, and although the Royal guard advised him to choose an older, more experienced Titan, he refused. You see, a King’s personal body guard is chosen at birth; they are always the same age so that they grow together and learn to trust each other. They are naturally the best of friends. The same was true of Lucan and Justice, your father. Lucan at that time, not having finished school but not wanting to be alone, had a special group of students chosen from all over the world to study with him at the Royal Palace. Your mother was one of those students and I’m afraid Lucan fell head over heels for her the moment he laid eyes on her; I suspect Justice did as well. Your mother was a very special girl; beautiful of course, talented beyond any other Immortal and smart, very smart. So naturally, Lucan pursued her. I’m afraid she saw his faults from the beginning and although she tried to persuade him to find someone else, he was persistent. When all of his attentions came to no avail he finally commanded her to be his wife. You are so much like her in every way that I’m sure you can imagine how she would react to a direct order such as marriage. But like I said, Lucan is stubborn, and blind to all reason, and so he gave her no choice.”
“But why didn’t Lucan try to find someone who actually liked him back?” I asked, confused why anyone would fall in love with someone who didn’t feel the same way.
“There are several reasons I believe; you see Lucan was scared. His father had died suddenly, leaving him the sole heir to the throne. Having no children of his own, and a fear of also dying young he was pressed to find a wife and begin a family. Since the Curse, no King has ever been able to produce more than one male heir. I believe that he is simply afraid of death; even still to this day. He is afraid of his precious bloodline dying. I believe he hoped your mother would cure all of that. You see, she is a very powerful Witch; probably the most powerful of her generation. And I believe that Lucan thought with their combined bloodline they would be able to save the line of kings.”
“What does her blood have to do with anything?” I asked, trying to stay focused. I suddenly yawned and realize how exhausted I was.
“She is the daughter of the last remaining Oracle. If you remember, the Oracles were the most powerful Immortals before the King’s Curse. Yes, that makes you the granddaughter of course.”
“But I thought all of the Oracles were dead?” I was really confused now.
“One remains, but I believe his soul died a long time ago,” Amory mumbled the last part, and I saw true sadness in his eyes. But then he continued quickly, “So, with that kind of magic mixed, Lucan was hoping for a super-child. He was hoping to bring back the old magic; the magic that disappeared when Derrick cursed us. Unfortunately though, for your mother, it was more than business that drew Lucan to her; he actually fell deeply in love with her. All of his attempts to win her over failed; and sometime during all of this Delia and Justice fell in love instead,” he shook his head as if frustrated with the memory of it.
“Delia,” I repeated softly, saying my mother’s name out loud for the first time. “So, he killed them?” I asked, terrified of the answer.
“No, he didn’t. They outsmarted him, but he hasn’t stopped hunting them to this day.”
“They’re alive?” I was shocked and stunned. My entire life I had been told my parents were dead. How was it possible they were still alive? And where were they?
“Truthfully child, I don’t know the answer to that question. Nobody has heard nor seen them since I received you and your brother on my doorstep when you were just infants, and even then you were the only proof I had seen that they were still alive. In all likelihood they probably are dead. I don’t how anyone could still be hiding from Lucan after this many years,” he looked at me with such sadness in his eyes that I was not sure I could bear to ask him another question.
“So how did they escape?” I forced myself to ask, remembering my interest in his story and accepting his answers so far.
“The same way we just did. They planned it very carefully. They must have practiced for months, maybe years, but they were eventually able to dismiss their magic and survive. They were the first Immortals to ever be able to live without magic. They conditioned their human bodies then to withstand the flight and one night they simply left. The wedding was planned and preparations were made, and then one night, when court was being held here, without a word to anyone they just left. Justice’s mother was a Shape-Shifter, one of the old ones, when she discovered her son missing; she shifted to look like your mother and played the part of Delia until she believed they were given enough time to escape. When Lucan discovered what she had done he had as many Shape-Shifters as he could get his hands on, executed gruesomely until she finally came forward. Once she was dead, he lifted the decree from execution to exile; but that is only part of the hell Shape-Shifters have lived through over the millennia. Your parents seemed to have disappeared forever, when about one hundred and fifty years later, you and Avalon showed up on my doorstep. Justice actually left you with Angelica and she brought you to me per their wishes, informing me that you were twins and that you were theirs. At that time they were still alive, but that was sixteen years ago. I do know she was healthy enough to bare twins, something that hadn’t been done since before Derrick was King.”
“And Lucan would kill me just because I look like my mother, although he thinks she’s dead?” I clarified.
“I am certain Lucan believes they are alive; I don’t doubt he has ever given up his search. If he were to uncover that you were Delia and Justice’s daughter, he would not only have you tortured, but most likely use you to bait out your mother and father. If he ever found out you had a twin brother, then I’m afraid all hell would break lose.”
“Why? Why does it matter that Avalon and I are twins?”
“Twins have always been rare within the Immortals, but since the King’s Curse they have been non-existent. With the old magic, twins were unparalleled for strength and power and on top of that they have a telepathic connection so they work together flawlessly. I have yet to see yours and Avalon’s true abilities, but the fact that you are twins is proof that you have all four types of magic in your recent genealogy, which is a miracle in itself. The interesting part is, you do not have the old magic, you have a new magic, something Immortals have never seen before. You are a rare and precious commodity Eden, something Lucan would do anything to possess…. and use,” Amory spoke with awe in his voice, and I found myself embarrassed by all of these facts. I was not sure if I wanted to be the secret weapon in a war I didn’t even know if I agreed with yet, for either side.
“How do I have all four types? I thought intermarriage was forbidden or whatever?” I asked, changing the subject a little.
“Let’s see, your grandfather was a Witch and an Oracle; your grandmother was a Medium; they also married in secret, but she was later killed because of it. Justice, you're father, was a Titan and his father a Titan, but his mother was a Shape-Shifter; something nobody knew until the fateful shift that began it all. That’s all four types and Avalon too; but your strongest traits are Witch and Avalon’s are Titan, although we try to make him play up his other ones. If he were to appear like a Titan, people would be suspicious why he isn’t with the Guard,” I lay back on the grass, unable to sit any longer and listened to the melodic tone in Amory’s voice.
“Ok, so now I understand why I shouldn’t have interrupted the trial. But why didn’t you tell me all of this before? If I would have known this, I wouldn’t have gone to all of the trouble of exposing myself. And Dream Walking to? Why didn’t you tell me that was real?” I whispered quietly, rubbing my eyes to keep them open.
A million stars lit up the night sky; I pondered for a moment that although I was half way across the world this was the same sky I looked up to when I was home in the middle of America. The night was still cold, but the magic buzzing steadily through my veins kept my blood warm.
“I couldn’t tell you this before because I wasn’t sure if you would be able to hide it from Kiran. I was afraid that if he found any of this out that it wouldn’t matter if you came to Romania or not. I have been waiting for Kiran to discover you this entire semester and turn you over to his father, but I’m afraid I underestimated him,” Amory said with almost curiosity in his voice. “And the Dream Walking, I hoped it was harmless. I was afraid that if you knew too much, that if you protected yourself from Kiran too much, that would also make him suspicious.”
“What do you mean?” I asked through another wide yawn.
“I think that Kiran has always known, or at least he’s known for some time. I’m not sure how he would have recognized you, but after his reaction in the courtroom I am almost positive he is aware of your identity,” I perked up a little by Amory’s answer. If he knew this entire time, why didn’t he ever say anything to me? Does that mean he was trying to protect me this whole time?
“So he knew who I was, but didn’t tell his father? What does that mean?” I rubbed my eyes again, determined to keep them open.
“I think it means he had the same reaction to you that his father had with your mother. He’s obviously hoping for a different outcome,” Amory replied, laughing a little.
“Star-crossed,” I mumbled.
“What’s that?” Amory asked, although I was sure he heard me.
“Nothing,” I answered quickly. “If you were so afraid of Kiran finding out about me, then how come you had me enroll at Kingsley?” my questions would keep coming as long as I could stay awake. I finally had someone giving me answers, I was not about to give up now. But then I yawned again, and realized it was only a matter of time before I was able to fight my exhausted body.
“I never would have had you come to Kingsley had I known that Kiran would be attending. But by the time we got the call about his arrival, you were already on your way to school. I had intended to intercede, but I couldn’t get to you before your run in with Kiran in the lobby of the Administration building. After that I had to hope for the best and protect you as best as I could. Kiran’s interest in you however, made me a failure as it turns out,” I expected Amory to be disappointed in what he considered a failure, but he sounded more entertained than anything.
“Why do you think he never told his father?” I asked again, not entirely sure what to think of the whole story. I closed my eyes, promising myself that I would stay awake and listen even if my tired eyes were shut.
“You said it best Eden…. star-crossed,” and then I found the sweet surrender of sleep beneath a wide open Romanian sky.


Chapter Forty-Four


Eden…. Where are you?
Something stirred me from my unconsciousness. I fought wakening, and attempted to once again fall into the deep abyss of sleep.
Damn it. Eden, where are you?
A sharper, irritated memory lifted me once again from sleep’s grasp. The memory felt strange, like it wasn’t mine, and even stranger like it was stumbling through a wilderness. I rolled over, and concentrated fully on finding sleep again.
Sticks and rocks jabbed into my side, poking through my oversized sweatshirt. My cheek was wet and grimy from damp leaves that had become my pillow. Gross. 
I sat up; realizing the memory that awoke me was not actually a memory but Avalon stumbling through the wilderness trying to find us. I rubbed my bleary eyes surprised by the light of morning. The forest was brightened by daylight, but it must have still been early morning because the sun was just barely shining from the peaks of the eastern mountain tops.
“Eden!” Avalon shouted through the trees. Apparently he got tired of waiting for me to figure out where his voice was coming from.
“Over here,” I struggled to shout back through a hoarse and scratchy morning voice. I cleared my throat and tried again, “Over here.”
I heard Avalon not far away, making his way noisily through the thick trees and underbrush. Someone was with him, although it was hard for me to determine the identity of their magic when I felt like I had just been run over by a bus. I was not sure how long I was asleep, but it wasn’t nearly long enough.
I stood up to brush the leaves and dirt off of me. My legs and back were incredibly sore and I heard several of my joints make a cracking noise as I fought to get to my feet. I didn’t have the patience to deal with tired muscles and aching bones this morning; I sent my magic surging through my body, heating my blood and relieving the tension in my exhausted appendages.
I felt instantly better, the magic did its job and my bones and muscles felt better than normal; I wasn’t sure if there was any hope for my external appearance however. I did my best to pick off the damp leaves and wipe away the dirt, but I began to think they had become a part of me. I reached my hand up to the top of my head in an attempt to deal with my hair, but after feeling around for a few seconds, brought it back down. There was no hope. I wouldn’t be surprised if I had to shave it off when I returned to civility.
“Holy crap….” Avalon blurted out as he made his way over the top of the last hill that separated us. “What happened to you?” he confirmed my obvious suspicions.
“Ugh,” I grunted back, not knowing where to even begin.
“Good morning, Eden,” Jericho called in a very chipper voice, following close behind Avalon. I waved at him irritably, remembering I had been the one to tell Avalon to bring him and bent over to tug on my ruined clog.
“Where’s Amory?” Avalon asked and I looked around confused. I didn’t remember when he left, or if he left; I didn’t remember anything. I must have been sleeping hard.
“I don’t know,” I said, feeling out of it.
“What do you mean you don’t know?” Avalon demanded, his defenses suddenly on high alert.
“They wouldn’t take him without her,” Jericho, the voice of reason, chimed in.
“You don’t know that. They could be hoping she leads them to the rest of us,” Avalon retorted, irritated and anxious.
“If anything it would be the other way around and you know that,” Jericho rolled his eyes and walked over to shake my hand. “Your brother is such a drama queen,” he joked.
“Tell me about it,” I agreed sarcastically. “And no more talking about me like I’m not here.” I addressed both boys. “I’m as much a part of this thing as you two. From now on, I am always included and always informed,” I folded my arms as if to strengthen my point.
Avalon rolled his eyes and began a search of the premises. I let him without any intention of joining him. I took Jericho’s side in that I thought wherever Amory was, he was just fine.
“You look like you just came through hell,” Jericho, still at my side, remarked.
“I pretty much feel like it.” I remembered my stiff body before I used the healing power of magic and cringed.
“So, what are you doing here anyways? I thought you had been ordered to stay at home?” Jericho pried for an explanation; but I was not totally sure if I was emotionally ready to relive the last seventy two hours.
“I don’t even know where to begin,” I looked past Jericho at the breathtaking view of the Carpathian Mountains. The sunrise had painted the sky beautiful shades of pink and orange, and the soft light made the autumn hues of the trees brilliant.
“You better figure it out,” Avalon grunted grumpily, while continuing his sweep of the perimeter. “I want a full debriefing, and I want a good reason why I had to leave my mission in the goddamn middle of the night,” I let out a burst of laughter when I looked over at Jericho and watched him roll his eyes.
“Your brother thinks he’s Napoleon Bonaparte,” he shook his head and watched Avalon disdainfully.
“Seriously though, have you heard anything?” I asked a little more humbly. I was the reason Avalon had to leave his mission. What if they weren’t successful and it was all my fault?
“No. We haven’t heard anything,” Jericho responded in a meek voice. “They’ve been incommunicado since before we left them.”
“When will you find out?” I was more nervous now than I had ever been.
“Not sure. If all went as planned, hopefully soon,” Avalon stopped his busy work to join us. He bit his thumbnail anxiously.
“Jericho and I are going to find out exactly what happened right now,” Amory was suddenly involved in our conversation, making his way over the same rise that Avalon and Jericho had come by. He was carrying a cloth bag with him that smelled like a bakery. My stomach growled loudly and I realized that I hadn’t eaten in days.
“Is that breakfast?” I asked, barely able to restrain myself from pouncing on Amory and ripping the bag open to find out myself.
“I thought you might be hungry,” he gave me a timid smile and opened the cloth satchel to reveal several loaves of bread, apples and bottles of water.
I grabbed a loaf of bread and discovered that it was still warm; it must have just finished baking. Immediately I tore off a piece and shoved it into my mouth. I could not have been more unladylike, but I was having trouble caring. Jericho watched me devour a loaf of bread in seconds with his mouth slightly open.
“What?” I mumbled through a full mouth.
“Like I was saying,” Amory also watched me with an expression that was both disgusted and amused. “Jericho and I will return to the Citadel to check the progress of the mission. If they failed last night without you, then most likely Jericho and I will have to do what we can alone this morning. The executions won’t start until the afternoon, so we have a couple of hours yet to do the impossible. Did everyone go last night, are we alone?”
“We left Roxie and Fiona to run communications once the channels were open again,” Avalon responded still chewing on his thumbnail. His stance was wide; he was totally in his element.
“Good, that will be good. Ok, so we will clean up in Sibiu. What about Lilly Mason? Is she with the others or in a different part of the castle?” Amory asked the question that had been gnawing at my heart since the boys arrived.
“Lilly Mason was released yesterday,” Avalon said incredulously.
“She was!” I practically shouted; I almost didn’t believe it was possible.
“Ok, good,” Amory responded, more calmly than I had managed. “Avalon you will take Eden back home immediately. And under no circumstances is she allowed to make any decisions. Do you understand?” Amory looked directly into my eyes. “Your friend is safe; there are no more reasons not to listen. You will do exactly as Avalon says. Got it?” I nodded quickly, I had no intentions of ever stepping out of line again, although I couldn’t help but feel like my efforts were worth it now that Lilly was free.  
“How do you want us to go? Timisoara?” Avalon asked as if he were a travel expert.
“No, it’s too exposed. You’re going to have to go the long way. I believe our most efficient but incognito option is to cross into Hungary, ditch the rental and take a bus or train into Austria, once in Austria utilize the trains. I think the Zurich airport will be your best bet to leave Europe undetected,” Avalon nodded along to Amory’s directions, but I felt completely lost. I tried to conjure up a picture of a European map in my head, but couldn’t trace the route mentally. I guessed I really would just have to trust Avalon. Oh boy.
“Do you want us to take our time?” Avalon asked all the right questions.
“No, get out of here as quickly as you can. The last thing we need is for you two to join the exiting traffic. Get home before the Festival is over,” More instructions I felt like I just barely understood. “Where are the cars?”
“Sighisoara,” Jericho answered.
“Good, good,” Amory paused for several moments and appeared to be going over things in his head. “Ok, I think that’s everything. We’ll see you at home,” Amory shook hands with Avalon and then Jericho and Avalon shook hands. The boys all began to walk back over the hill and I followed quickly behind them.
Once over the hill I saw that we were at the edge of the town they had just been talking about. The town of Sighisoara was spread out in a quaint and quiet cityscape that fanned over the smaller foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. The buildings were hundreds of years old and the still sleeping city had a very ancient world feel to it.
I kept pace with Avalon until we found the cars tucked away in the rustic village. Both vehicles were the classic Dacia’s that seemed to be the only style of car allowed in Romania. Avalon pulled out a set of keys and politely opened the passenger’s side door for me.
“Oh Eden, take this,” Amory walked over and handed me the cloth bag of food. I pulled out an apple and immediately took a bite. My grimy teeth were grateful for the natural cleansing the apple blessed them with. “There is a set of clothes at the bottom of the bag,” Amory kissed the top of my head before returning to the other rusted Dacia where Jericho was waiting.
“What’s wrong with what I’m wearing?” I asked sarcastically. Amory grinned happily back. “Hey Amory,” I yelled quickly as he began to enter his car, he paused, looking up at me. “Thank you,” I said, full of emotion.
“One day, I hope you return the favor,” his smile turned sad and then he was in the car and Jericho was driving away, leaving us in their trail of heavy exhaust.
“Let’s go,” Avalon yelled impatiently at me.
I sat down on the worn upholstery and thought longingly of my yellow Land Rover. I would never take it for granted again. I continued to munch on my apple, feeling very much at peace. Avalon gunned the gas and took off through the winding, hilly streets of another beautiful Romanian city.
I decided that I would very much like to come back to Romania under different circumstances. I couldn’t help but be excited for the remaining leg of my journey. Compared to the last few days it sounded very relaxing. For my first trip to Europe, I felt like this was quite the crash course. At least for the second portion I would have company, and it sounded like Avalon knew where he is going. That would be a nice change.
“So Lilly was really released?” I asked, breaking the silence.
“I guess so. Apparently your boyfriend spoke on her behalf and she was given a second chance. They’re going to let her return to Kingsley and everything,” Avalon’s voice was skeptical and I had a hard time believing the news as well.
I sat back, admiring the scenery, once again silent. Kiran did save Lilly. I made him promise he would, but after the fact I wasn’t sure what to expect. Butterflies attacked my stomach as I remembered the emotion in his eyes during our farewell.
The depth of longing I felt for him didn’t seem possible for someone my age. My heart was gripped with clarity; completely full of adoration for the boy I could officially consider the love of my life. My magic was stirred with the memories of our energies mingled and wild together. My cheeks blushed at the thought of my mouth once again pressed against his.
Against all reason and circumstance we had found each other in a world torn apart by our very existence. In order to be together we would have to defy all odds, defy all logic, and defy all influence. I saw two battlefields in front of me; the one that pinned Kiran against me, and the one that we would have to forge in order to be together. I understood the purpose of the Resistance, but the battle I chose to fight would be the one that brought me closer to the man I loved with every fiber of my being.


Chapter Forty-Five


I stretched my arms and lifted my head off of the cold glass window. I yawned wide and shook my head, making the crick in my neck disappear. Looking out at the Austrian country side flying by, I smiled. Europe had captured my heart; if only I hadn’t been on the run to save my life.
Avalon seemed in deep thought as he too stared out of the train window in silence. Field, farm, field, farm, lake, field, farm, mountain…. Austria was breathtaking. Of course I said the same thing about Romania, and then again about the rustic beauty of Hungary. Austria was a different kind of beauty however. The clean and contemporary buildings and more modern farms made it clear that this was a different side of Europe.
I pulled my ivory cardigan closer around my waist; the train air was frigid and although I was grateful for the new set of clothes Amory picked out for me, they were obviously picked for convenience and practicality, and not necessarily style. A pair of baggy, brown work pants clearly meant for a man, a plaid red colored shirt and an ivory cardigan felt like the nicest clothes anyone had ever given me after what my cruise wear had been through. I also had had to retire my Nebraska sweatshirt; but I promised myself I would buy another one paying tribute to the Huskers when I returned home.
I wiped my fingers beneath my eyes, self-consciously. I remembered what I looked like when I was finally able to assess the damage in a Hungarian train station bathroom. I did the best I could to rinse out and wash my hair in the small sink; I at least had gotten it out of the hair tie and into a neat bun on the nape of my neck. It wasn’t pretty, but at least I didn’t look crazy anymore.
My face, arms and legs were covered in dirt and grime and I would definitely need a long, hot shower to feel completely clean, but I was much improved, although my legs needed a good shave.
My face took the longest to scrub clean; besides the dirt, I had to deal with a mess of makeup plastered to my face. Never again would I travel wearing non-waterproof mascara and black eyeliner. By the time I exited the small bathroom, my face was bright red and swollen from all of the scrubbing.
I sent a burst of magic through my body, heating my blood and awakening my senses. Avalon naturally felt the surge himself and sat up a little straighter. I smiled at him, hoping to draw him into conversation, but he stared past me in a dreamlike state. He was so worried about the outcome of the mission he could barely function. And even though he carried an international phone and glanced at it every other second, we hadn’t heard from anyone since we left Romania.
Avalon was skilled at international travel and clearly used to being followed. He had taken every precaution necessary to ensure we were alone. After ditching the Dacia on the Romania/Hungary border, he set it on fire, making sure any physical evidence we left behind would be destroyed. We then took a bus through most of Hungary, changing only once we were close to the Austrian border. Since Austria we had changed trains as often as we could while still moving in the general direction of Switzerland.
I couldn’t help but enjoy the trip however. Riding a European train was like truly riding in style. The glory of the Austrian Alps was like nothing I had ever experienced before; and I would gladly ride a train through them until I had every mountain memorized.
The game plan was to fly home from Zurich; who knew how many trains that meant before we were in the heart of Switzerland. Only Avalon was concerned about our timing though. I was too swept away with Europe to be in any hurry to leave.
Avalon’s phone buzzed gently and suddenly he sat up completely alert. I noticed the tension in his body and felt his anxiety as he opened the cell phone and answered quietly.
“Hello?” he asked softly, discretely.
“Oh, thank God,” I saw his body visibly relax and felt the apprehension turn to silent joy. “Is the package in the mail?” he asked, using code. I couldn’t help but laugh; he was like the obvious cliché for a 1950’s spy. Next thing you knew, we would be on our way to Russia to stop the Kremlin.
“What?” he asked, suddenly exasperated. “You can’t be serious! I’m not doing that. No way. I might as well send her to the London palace with instructions on how to find the rest of us. No way….” whatever he was so upset about, he had dropped all pretense of code. “No way….” he repeated over and over to whatever the other line was saying.
“Where?” he asked eventually, with a softer but more frustrated tone. The hostility in his voice was unmistakable. “How do we know it’s not a trap?” he listened a little longer, his magic growing stronger and stronger every second. I wouldn’t have been surprised if the humans could feel it for themselves. “What happens if you’re wrong?” Avalon listened longer, but did not seem appeased.
“If I do this, I want some type of insurance; some type of trade off…. We would have gotten her out of there even if he didn’t do anything. That doesn’t make him a hero; it just makes him look like an idiot!” Avalon stopped talking to get an earful from whoever was on the other line. I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat, totally engrossed in Avalon’s side of the conversation.
“Fine…. I said fine. I guess we’ll see you in Geneva,” Avalon snapped the phone shut and glared at me. I was almost too afraid to ask what that had been about.
“Geneva?” I asked tentatively.
“I guess so,” he mumbled.
“Switzerland?” I tried again.
Avalon nodded affirmatively.
“What happened to Zurich?” I finally asked bravely.
“We’ve been ordered,” Avalon paused and cleared his throat irritably, “asked.... if we would oblige the Crown Prince by joining him in Geneva,” he couldn’t even look at me, but turned to glare out the window.
“It’s not a trap Avalon,” I said quickly but quietly; my stomach filled with butterflies.
“I do not want to talk about it,” Avalon responded grumpily and I knew better than to push it. 

----

A black sedan pulled up in front of the train station and Avalon took the initiative to approach. I followed behind, shouldering my backpack once again. A man exited the driver’s side to open the back door for us. Avalon stuck his head menacingly into the back seat before entering the car fully. I smiled apologetically to the driver and climbed in behind Avalon.
Avalon sat with arms folded and his back turned to me. I knew he was mad, but I also didn’t think I really deserved the silent treatment for the last eight hours. I elbowed him roughly in the kidneys before the driver had returned to his seat, but he didn’t respond.
I was irritated with Avalon, but soon my bad feelings turned to adoration as we drove silently through Geneva at night. The streets were lit in the soft glow of streetlamps and from the bright windows of buildings built before America was even a recognized country. 
Our ride took us past Lake Geneva, glistening in the moonlight. A large fountain sprayed a cascade of water from the middle of the lake, and the Alps sat as a backdrop to the perfect postcard picture. The streets were narrow, with historical buildings rising to either side. I marveled at their intricate architecture, and embellished building fronts.
When the car finally came to a stop in front of a charming palace, I was somehow not surprised. After witnessing the grand architecture and style of the Citadel, I was finally able to wrap my head around the words “Monarchy” and “Crown Prince.” I hadn’t really been expecting quite this grandeur however.
“Is this one of their palaces?” I whispered, hoping Avalon would answer.
“This is a hotel,” Avalon responded irritably. I blushed, feeling very ignorant. “Ok, it used to be one of their palaces; now it’s just a hotel,” After feeling my embarrassment, Avalon conceded the truth.
The palace turned hotel was exquisite. I was dumbstruck by the beauty and elegance of what was formerly Kiran’s family’s home. I followed Avalon out of the car and stayed timidly behind him. I glanced down at my ill-fitting, makeshift outfit and felt embarrassingly under-dressed.
As we entered the foyer of the grand hotel my mouth dropped open in awe. We were surrounded by marble pillars that reached from expansive marbled floor to vaulted marble ceiling. Intricately, upholstered furniture with golden thread filled the entrance hall. The only evidence that this was not a palace but indeed a hotel was the circulation desk with uniformed employees standing behind it.
My nerves were on edge thanks to Avalon; although he appeared relaxed and calm, his magic was surging at high alert. Because of our connection my senses were heightened with his and our magic circulated in unison. He bypassed the hotel clerks and headed straight up a wide, winding, ivory staircase.
After walking up several flights of stairs, Avalon led me into a long hallway. The hairs on the back of my neck rose suddenly when I felt the strong presence of other Immortals. Avalon slowed his pace and I noticed him clench and unclench his fists regularly.
We walked the hallway slowly and I didn’t complain. I was not sure what to expect but Avalon was so uncomfortable and tense that I regretted him coming. I felt like it was my fault and therefore also felt guilty and blameworthy; but then remembered we were ordered to come here and I was even ordered specifically not to make any more decisions. I sent this thought poignantly to Avalon; he returned it with a dirty look.
At the end of the hallway Avalon paused and took a big breath. He raised his fist to knock on the cream colored door but paused again as if he couldn’t make himself do it.
“I don’t know what’s behind this door Eden,” Avalon whispered fiercely to me and I was surprised by the apprehension in his voice. “We could be walking into a trap…. Eden,” He paused again and I waited nervously, expecting some type of brotherly declaration, instead Avalon continued, “Eden, let me have Kiran; I’ll enjoy killing him much more than you will.”
Before I could think of any response Avalon knocked forcefully on the door. He gave me another nervous sideways glance and shoved his hands deep into his pockets to appear casual. I wished he felt as calm as he was working so hard to look; his nervous energy was making me edgy.
Talbott opened the door and for some reason that surprised me. He was dressed casually and his hair was a little messier than at school. When he opened the door he was laughing and involved in a conversation. Avalon stared at him suspiciously, until he gestured with his hand for us to enter.
I was more than a little surprised to find Amory in the extravagant room. He was sitting on a plush, periwinkle sofa, holding a snifter full of a golden brown liquid. He was the one involved in conversation with Talbott, and it appeared they were having a very animated but pleasant conversation.
Avalon grunted grumpily before taking a seat close to Amory. Although he relaxed his magic a little, he was still in a sour mood. Avalon reclined in his seat and slammed his feet cross-legged onto the gold, inlaid, glass coffee table. His movement made a terrible crashing sound although he managed not to shatter the fragile antique.
The attention of everyone in the room was now on Avalon who smiled smugly in reply. Amory relaxed on the sofa and put an arm around Avalon in a very paternal way. I stood in the middle of the room not entirely sure what to do.
“I’m glad you’re safe, Eden,” Talbott said out of the blue. I was not the only one surprised by his statement.
“Thank you,” I replied humbly.
“Eden?” Kiran appeared out of the bedroom and said my name almost reverently.
I turned to face him and was struck ferociously with emotion. He stood in the doorway, hair tussled and eyes piercing. His hands fidgeted nervously, but his gaze never left mine and never softened in intensity.
Moments ago, I hadn’t known whether to sit or stand, but once I saw the look of pure desire cross Kiran’s face I knew there was only one place I wanted to be. I closed the distance between us in seconds, sprinting across the expansive suite and leaping into his arms.
He caught me instinctively and found my mouth immediately. My legs wrapped around his waist and my hands held his face firmly to mine; our magic mingled together in a perfect symphony of all consuming power.
At this most passionate moment there was no one else besides Kiran and nothing else existed besides our love. I was thrilled to find his feelings as intense as mine. My thoughts, my consciousness, my very blood filled with a desire bigger than me, bigger than I could even hope to understand.
I could have lived in that moment forever, but like all good things it had to come to an end. After several throat clears from our audience and then a pillow to the back of my head thanks to Avalon, I relinquished my hold on Kiran. He set me down gently and then kissed me one more time sweetly on the lips.
“Ok, that’s enough…. seriously,” Avalon interrupted in an irritated voice. “The rest of us are trying to exist here; we don’t need your crazy magic suffocating us.”
I turned around embarrassed, heat flooded my cheeks. Avalon could not look more disgusted and Amory and Talbott couldn’t even look in our general direction. Kiran intertwined his fingers through mine and pulled me closer to him protectively.
“Excuse us, gentlemen,” Kiran addressed the room politely; his crisp, English accent perfectly enunciating every consonant.


Chapter Forty-Six


Kiran walked backwards into one of the bedrooms of the massive suite, pulling me with him. If I thought I felt humiliation before, that was nothing compared to the sweeping embarrassment of being taken into Kiran’s bedroom with three sets of suspicious eyes following my every step. Luckily, Kiran closed the door quickly behind us.
The bedroom looked like some place a prince would stay. A huge four poster bed with royal blue and gold striped silk comforter sat in the middle of the room facing an enormous flat screened TV. Kiran’s suitcase and clothes were laid haphazardly on a royal blue divan. I noticed a golden crown half buried underneath a pair of designer jeans.
Kiran walked across the room, pulling me behind him, and out onto a balcony overlooking Lake Geneva. The moonlight glistened off the black water and I saw the outline of the Swiss Alps in the distance; their tall peaks turning white at the top, billowy clouds resting on them, melting into mere extensions of a vast midnight sky.
The mid-autumn night air was frigid and I sent a burst of magic through my blood to warm up.
“Did you know that you can use your magic for more than an occasional space heater?” Kiran asked softly but sarcastically, while leaning back against the outer wall of the hotel. 
“I’m cold,” I responded, a little defensively.
“Here….” he replied, pulling me against his body. I laid my head against his chest and listened to the soft beating of this heart. 
“Thank you for saving Lilly,” I mumbled into his warm embrace.
“My pleasure,” he replied, amused. “And thank you for nearly getting yourself killed. Thank goodness your grandfather was there to help you escape. I don’t know how I would have survived losing you,” he held me tighter, kissing the top of my head.
“I’m sorry, did you say grandfather?” I asked, wishing I could just dwell on Kiran's sweet sentiments, but instead I found myself unable to move past the next big mystery of my life revealed. Would it never end?
“Yes, you’re grandfather…. Amory.” Kiran paused to look me in the eyes. “Are you telling me you didn’t know that he is your grandfather?” he asked incredulously.
“I had no idea….” I laughed out loud a little. “But I guess it makes sense,” I could now explain away all of the times Amory seemed so paternal, apparently he was just being grandfatherly.
“I’m sorry; I didn’t mean to spoil anything,” Kiran gave me his signature smirk and I swore I fell even more in love with him.
“It’s alright; something tells me he was waiting for me to figure it out on my own,” I returned my head to Kiran’s chest, butterflies flooding my stomach.
“He should know better than to wait for that,” Kiran joked lightly.
I couldn’t help but agree with him. I hadn’t figured anything out on my own yet, what made Amory think I would start with that?
“God only knows what I have left to figure out,” I mumbled.
“Yes He does, but He’s gotten you this far….” Kiran surprised me with his answer.
“Do you believe in God?” I asked, confused.
“Of course. Don’t you?” I pulled my head away from his chest to look him in the eye; for some reason I found it hard to believe he was serious.
“I mean I guess I did when I was human, but now I don’t know what to believe,” I left the closeness of his embrace, feeling slightly embarrassed and walked over to the balcony’s edge.
“That seems backwards to me,” Kiran responded and joined me. We stood silently for a moment enjoying the beauty of Lake Geneva before he continued, “You believed in God when you thought you were human; when you suffered pain and hunger, tyranny and war. But now that you live above that, with unlimited power and unlimited life you doubt that there is an entity greater than you? Someone created all of this, all of the beauty of the earth, all of the fragility of human life and all of the extraordinary existence of us. Choosing to believe in God only when you are surrounded by death and destruction is to truly not know God at all.”
Kiran put an arm around me and kissed the top of my head again. Despite his point, I knew his feelings for me were as strong as ever.
“Am I not still surrounded by death and destruction?” I asked, feeling characteristically defensive.
“No, you’re not. Believe me. I’ve done my homework; you could not have a stronger genealogy. But the rest of us, yeah…. maybe…. But isn’t that where we find our substance? I think there is a certain beauty to death; a macabre exquisiteness that brings meaning to life.”
I stood there gazing at Kiran with so much emotion I felt like I would explode. Avalon was right, I had no idea who Kiran was, but the more I learned, the more I fell madly in love with him.
I threw my arms around his neck and pulled him into another passionate kiss. He gladly reciprocated.  
“Excuse me, sir,” Talbott interrupted, like usual. “It’s time for Eden to go.”
Kiran paused for only a second to wave Talbott away before returning to me. He pressed his lips against mine fervently; lifting me off of the ground and making me forget the world around me. Our magic became an intense force; rising around us with an almost visible presence.
Eventually he returned my feet to the ground and my mind slowly returned to reality. He smiled at me as if holding onto a secret and my heart fluttered with the sweet memories of his mouth against mine.
“You just got here and now you have to go," Kiran gazed at me with all of the intensity of a boy madly in love. "I just had to know that you were all right. I had to see you," he kissed the top of my head sweetly and continued, "Before we join the others, I have something for you,” Kiran led me back into his bedroom and pulled out a black, square, velvet box from his suitcase.
He opened the box to reveal a necklace and pulled out the long silver chain to expose a pendant intricately woven with several black stones placed throughout. He clasped the beautiful, complex accessory around my neck and the stones turned from black to a brilliant shade of blue. I fingered the pendant in my hands, amazed by the color and loveliness of the stones.
“I thought so,” Kiran said cryptically and kissed me on the cheek. “Eden, when we return to Kingsley things are going to be difficult. We won’t be able to see each other or be together, at least not easily. I am going to continue my engagement with Seraphina and go on like nothing has changed. You will have to stay far away from me,” he cupped my face in his hands and I saw the pain in his eyes.
“But why?” I asked, scared and upset.
“I’m so sorry, Love. But you have to go on playing the part Amory created for you. As of now, my father is convinced that you are not your mother. After several interrogations, the most convincing of which was Seraphina’s, he agreed to let it go. She was pretty adamant that you are no one special, especially not Delia Saint. But that doesn't mean he will stay pacified. We cannot draw any unnecessary attention to you. I am determined to keep you to myself. His suspicions are small, but you’ve raised his curiosity and so we have to keep you as far under the radar as possible without making you disappear completely,” he held me closer to him as if to prove his point.
“So I can’t see you at all?” I asked, afraid of the answer.
“No, I will find a way for us to be together, I will. But we will have to be extremely careful. You can’t show that necklace to anyone; but I wanted you to have it as a token of my love.”
“Your love?” I said the words religiously.
“Yes, my love. Because Eden, I have loved you avidly from the first moment I saw you and I will love you completely with all that I am until the day I die,” his eyes had hypnotized mine and I was transfixed by their passion. He grinned sheepishly at me and I realized he didn’t grasp the seriousness of my feelings for him.
“Kiran Kendrick, I love you too,” I whispered, my throat closed and my eyes full of emotion.
He swept me into another passionate kiss and I melted into his embrace. When he finally released me I felt weak from my expended magic. Kiran led me back into the living room, but not before I tucked his gift beneath my plaid work shirt.
Avalon and Amory stood near the door waiting anxiously. Kiran kissed my hand sweetly and mouthed “I love you,” I blushed and joined my grandfather and twin brother at the door.
“Thank you again, Kiran…. for everything,” Amory said humbly before we made our exit.

----

“Scoot over!” I demanded irritably while shoving my elbow into Avalon’s ribs. Sitting between Avalon and Titus on the eight hour flight home was not ideal for anyone. But it was Amory’s great idea of added protection; although in my personal opinion totally unnecessary.
“That’s it!” I declared loudly, and stood up as dramatically as the small coach cabin would allow. “Move!”
Avalon obeyed and slid his knees into the aisle so that I could pass. I walked unsteadily between the rows of seats and passed several members of the rescued Resistance team, until I found Amory staring out his window pensively.
I fell heavily into the seat next to him, not really caring if I bothered him or not. He looked up at me and smiled. I grinned back, pleased that I had the upper hand, if only for a moment.
“What happens now, grandpa?” I asked, barely able to contain my laughter.
His expression turned anxious and then relaxed when he saw my smile. He laughed a little himself and I was glad that at least it didn’t seem he wanted that information to remain a secret.
“When did you figure it out?” he asked, still smiling, but not quite able to look me in the eyes.
“Kiran told me, kind of on accident. He assumed I already knew…. silly him,” I said sarcastically. Amory’s face flushed with embarrassment. “So you’re the last remaining Oracle. You seem pretty alive to me,” I joked.
“For now,” Amory flushed deeper with embarrassment. “That’s a much longer conversation, for a more private setting,” he cut me off when my I opened my mouth to ask a million questions.
 “Ok, but I’m going to hold you to that,” I paused for a moment before continuing, “So really what happens when we get home?” I decided on a different topic that I had just as many questions for.
“Well first we explain everything to Sylvia. That will be our first battle. She has been worried sick. You’re lucky I was able to talk to her yesterday, I hopefully softened the blow,” he gave me a stern, parental glare and it was my turn to blush from discomfort.
“Then what?” I asked timidly.
“I’m not sure; I’m afraid most of this is now out of our hands. For the first time, in a long time, our futures lay in the hands of someone I don’t know what to expect from,” he turned his head to return his thoughtful gazing out the window and I realized he was referring to Kiran.
“But we’re not going to try to kill him anymore, right?” I sounded more casual than I felt. My throat closed with emotion and my hands trembled a little at the thought. Even though I was on the side of the Resistance, I had no idea if it was a place I could stay, especially if they tried to continue with their original plans.
“No, my dear. I could never hurt someone you cared about so deeply. You don’t need to be worried anymore,” he put an arm around me, and continued to look quietly out of the small window.
I sunk into my own personal pensiveness, wondering if Lucan would really leave me alone or if he would hurt me in pursuit of my parents. If they were still out there, where were they? I doubted I could help Lucan find them anyways; I certainly had no way to look for them.  
A hundred questions swirled through my mind, but the questions that kept demanding to be answered first were when would I get to see Kiran again? When would we get to be alone again and when would I feel safe once more in his arms?  
As unlikely as our love affair might have been, loving Kiran was the only concrete path I could imagine. I was wholly consumed with a love that would probably get me killed, but I would never have chosen any other way. I could not have chosen any other way. We were truly destined for each other, fated to be together…. we were star-crossed.


Keep reading for an excerpt from Hopeless Magic, the second installment of The Star-Crossed Series.



I followed Lilly through the other side of the barn and around the large white farmhouse. A small group of other Immortals walked silently with us. All of them were the older generation except Avalon, whom I noticed was allowed more of a leadership role than anyone else our age, including me.
Angelica led our small group behind the farmhouse and down into a storm cellar. Lilly and I followed Conrad, Terrance, Amory and Avalon down a set of worn stone steps. The men all carried fiery torches and as we walked through a surprisingly long tunnel, they stopped and lit suspended torches along the wall.
What I expected to be a typical Nebraska tornado shelter, meant to protect from seasonal storms, had turned into a long, but wide tunnel, leading further and further into the earth. The already cold November night continued to stiffen the frigid air the farther into the passageway we walked.
Lilly’s hand in mine, I could feel her tremble with anxiety. The look on her face was sheer determination, etched with near panicked hysteria. Her already pale skin had turned translucent by fear and her vibrant red curls framed her face in a haze of frizz. I squeezed her hand, hoping to comfort, except I couldn’t help but empathize her same fears.
Eventually we came to a thick stone door. The small group ahead of us mounted their torches into frames already nailed to the walls. Through the dim firelight I could see small markings bordering the outline of the door and then another large symbol set exactly in the middle at eye level: a snake, wrapped in a circle, swallowing its’ own tail.
Angelica was the first one through the door. She put her finger, just below her ear, where her jawbone met her neck and I watched the faint flare of light. I realized she was illuminating the same symbol of the snake eating its own tail, the same symbol Lilly was on her way to receive. Angelica carried the magic in her finger, from her neck to the symbol in the door. She placed her index finger ever so softly on the serpent and I watch with quiet awe as the door glowed in the same color as Angelica’s magic before opening into a circular room.
The door closed behind Angelica and Conrad was next in line. He repeated the same procedure as Angelica, only this time the door illuminated in army green, to resemble the brand of magic he carried. I realized at that moment that I may not be able to keep my promise to Lilly, since it seemed to enter the secret room of the Resistance, one must already be a member or on their way to become one.
I squeezed Lilly’s hand tighter as I watched Terrance and then Avalon both enter the room in turn. Amory turned towards us, his expression pure excitement. He held out his hand to Lilly and she accepted the offer silently.
“I’m afraid you won’t be able to join us, Eden dear. Unless you are also willing to join our humble cause tonight,” I saw the hope in his black eyes and felt ashamed when I shook my head no.
“Then you had better wait out here,” his smile softened into a sadder version of happiness and I was struck with guilt. Some small part of me understood that I could not waver in the middle much longer. Sooner or later I would have to make a choice; I would have to join a cause that would eventually lead to the death of the person I loved with all of my soul, or I would have to turn my back on this cause and alienate myself entirely from the only family I would ever have.
I squeezed Lilly’s hand one more time before letting go and gave her an encouraging smile. She returned my smile with renewed confidence and I suddenly felt envious. Her brilliant emerald eyes shone with sheer determination and something more, something much like victory. Then, Amory was lighting the door and I watched them disappear behind the thick wall of stone.
Can I watch? I spoke to my twin brother telepathically, hoping he would understand my need to be involved. Although I could have easily opened our twin sense and made the decision for myself, I felt obligated to ask Avalon for his permission. I had a hard time invading his privacy unannounced. He, on the other hand, had absolutely no problem spying on me.
As long as you don’t interrupt. Avalon replied, slightly exasperated. I loved my brother dearly, but when he was in super commando leader mode, I couldn’t help but find him more than a little irritating.
I leaned against the cool stone wall in the wide passageway. On this side of the door the torches flickered, casting long shadows on the rough floor. I closed my eyes and melted my mind with Avalon’s, opening my senses with our similar magic. I saw through his eyes, heard through his ears and felt through his senses.
Although my vision was limited to what Avalon was looking at, I could still take in the room. The space behind the thick stone door was smaller than I had imagined it to be. A large, dark wooden chair sat in a circular area, illuminated only by candle light. Hundreds of tiered candles sat on long, low tables circling the rooms. They took up most of the wall space, except where a door was located.
There were four other doors besides the stone one blocking my path. They were wooden, and not made from stone; however, the same symbolic snake crested them as well. A deep pot of sorts sat not far from the lone chair that Lilly had now taken. The large cauldron was full of some type of iridescent liquid and although I couldn’t see any fire beneath the pot, it seemed to be bubbling as if boiling. 
Avalon stared at Lilly intently. I could see the tension in her eyes and she gripped the armrests of the chair tightly with both hands. Amory was asking her a series of questions and she nodded confidently despite the terror I could tell she was feeling.
Avalon was also tense; I could feel that he was afraid she would back out. I could feel him admire her beauty, which felt a little bizarre coming from Avalon, and that he would desperately like her to join the cause. In part, but not entirely, he felt that way because he thought Lilly would have influence over me. I smiled on the outside of the door, wondering if he was right.
“Lilly Elizabetta Mason, you are about to join a cause that stands directly opposed to the Monarchy and King and if you are found out the price is your life. Are you sure you want to give up your rights as an Immortal, your eternal life as an Immortal and your fate as an Immortal, surrendering them all under the cause of the Resistance?” Amory asked Lilly gravely. 
She responded with a strong “Yes.”
“Then Lilly, through any trial, tribulation, torture and trap the Resistance will always give you aid, always give you support and always give you sacrifice. You are, little sister, one of us, wholly, and forever.”
Amory paused to smile benevolently and reassuringly at Lilly before gesturing toward Conrad and Terrance. They moved towards Lilly in slow but swift movements and then began to strap her down with restraints I had not noticed before, attached to the chair.
I stood up straight, overcome with anxiety for my dear friend. Why on earth would they need to strap her down? She looked like she was about to be electrocuted by some old school torture tool, something straight out of a fifties era death row chamber. And although I could see that Lilly was willfully allowing them to tie her to the chair, and through it all she seemed to have significantly calmed down, I could not believe she really understood what she was about to go through.
I began to pace the hallway nervously, doing my best to find a way into that room. If things went badly for Lilly, I refused to do nothing. I did not risk my life to save her in Romania from Lucan, only to bring her back to Omaha and watch her die at the hands of my brother and grandfather.
Calm down. You’re so dramatic. Avalon sent me a thought and I inwardly cringed, realizing I had promised not to interrupt him.
You better not hurt her. I seethed through my thoughts, finding it slightly ironic he was the one calling me dramatic. He rolled his eyes, not only inwardly but physically as well.
Eden, the whole process is hurt. She’s going to be in a lot of pain in just a few seconds and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. Just remind yourself that she chose this path, and this path comes with a price. Avalon’s words hit a nerve and I was suddenly agitated. I knew that he didn’t mean to hurt me, but he was right. She chose this path willingly and there was absolutely nothing I could do about it.
When I tuned back in to the events unfolding beyond the stone door, Lilly was completely buckled down, from the top of her head to the soles of her feet. She looked painfully uncomfortable even if this was her choice. Besides the chair restraints, Conrad, Terrance and Amory had also taken hold of her as if adding to the support of the buckles.
Angelica stood in the corner near the bubbling cauldron of shimmering light. She had put on a pair of long, thick work gloves and held a lengthy, cylindrical glass tube with a bulb on one end and a narrowed point on the other. When Amory nodded his head, Angelica dipped the cylinder into the vessel point side down. She stirred the flickering illumination around until the tube itself seemed to be full of the same mystery; something not quite liquid, not quite light.
When the glass bulb itself began to glisten, she pulled the cylinder out of the cauldron. Angelica walked carefully, methodically over to Lilly, holding the glass cylinder by the point. Once she reached her, she took a long moment to breathe and maybe meditate before pressing the bulb against Lilly’s neck and jawbone just beneath her right earlobe.
Suddenly I understood the restraints. As soon as the glass tube touched Lilly’s skin she let out a blood-curdling scream that engulfed the small room. I covered my ears instinctively, although technically no sound reached beyond the stone door.
Lilly began to thrash aggressively, despite the fact that she had three grown men and numerous buckles holding her down. Her eyes rolled into the back of her head and I could see her seize violently. She continued to scream, loud and menacingly, a sound that would haunt me for a very long time.
Despite Lilly’s struggle, Angelica continued to hold the glass cylinder to her neck, never faltering, never moving. I noticed the light inside the tube begin to drain, and Lilly’s skin begin to shine a shade of shimmering violet. Her entire being was engulfed in the beautiful lilac, shining and glistening.
If my friend wasn’t in so much terrifying pain I would have found the effect absolutely captivating. Unfortunately, despite her beauty, Lilly seemed to be in an insurmountable amount of hurt. She continued to scream and shake long past the last drops of light had drained into her skin.
Suddenly the shimmering lavender intensified into a deep and bright purple, painting everything in the small room with its concentrated color. As quickly as the color grew bright, it diminished into a small snake eating its tale just below the earlobe of Lilly’s right ear. And finally there was silence; Lilly slumped, unmoving in her chair.
I relaxed, exhaling a breath I had not realized I was holding. Apparently my relief was premature however, as only seconds after Lilly had calmed down, she began again with another round of screaming and thrashing. I left Avalon’s head unable to withstand the sight of my dear friend enduring so much pain. I cowered against the wall and let out a choking sob.
The door opened slightly and Avalon slipped through to my side of the stone. His face was etched with the same pain that I imagined mine was, minus the tears. He stood facing me with a mixture of sorrow and exhaustion that aged him for a moment. For only a moment, I didn’t see my sometimes irritating and always overdramatic twin brother; in his place I saw a great leader, and a great man. I shook my head quickly, reminding myself of the here and now.
“Where is she?” I peered around Avalon, expecting the door to open again at any second.
“She has to stay here for a while. She has to recover,” Avalon spoke softly and with compassion.
“What do you mean? We have school,” I said plainly, as if the choice Lilly just made shouldn’t interfere with high school.
“Lilly won’t be able to come to school for a while Eden. You don’t need to worry about her though; she’s in very capable hands,” Avalon began walking towards the exit and I followed, realizing he was right.
“She will be alright?” I asked timidly. I wanted to trust him, I knew I needed to trust him, but the image of Lilly facing so much physical pain would give me nightmares. I could not imagine going through the same torture myself willingly.
“Of course. I’m just fine, aren’t I?” Avalon replied and I held back a sarcastic thought. “Just fine,” was pretty relative. “Besides don’t you have a rendezvous with what’s his name? You better forget about Lilly for now, until that kid isn’t around anymore. Eden, he can’t know anything about her induction, got it?” his compassion had turned into hard lecturing, although I did understand his point.
“I got it,” I replied, confident that it wouldn’t be a problem, but uncertain Lilly’s induction wouldn’t cloud my thoughts the rest of the evening all the same. “And you can use Kiran’s name. Amory’s not going to kick you out or anything.” 
Avalon only grunted his reply. We both knew Amory was not the problem. Avalon hated Kiran with a passion and never missed an opportunity to remind me.
Despite Avalon, I blushed at the thought of seeing Kiran tonight. I hadn’t seen him alone since before we came home, at his hotel suite in Geneva, Switzerland. Our time there was so intimate and special I had been nervous about seeing him again since.
Kiran sent Talbott over late last night to inform me of our date tonight. Well, I didn’t really know if you could call it a date, but we would finally get to be together…. away from school, away from Seraphina and away from Talbott. The horror of Lilly’s induction faded quickly when replaced with the sweet thoughts of our upcoming moments together.
“You mean booty call? I’m coming by the way,” Avalon interrupted my daydreams and I stopped dead in my tracks.
“What?” I squealed.
“Eden, seriously?” Avalon turned around to give me his best chastising glare. “Prime surveillance opportunity. Wouldn’t miss it for the world,” he turned quickly on his heel, leaving me gaping after him. A date with Kiran might be more than a little awkward if Avalon was planning on chaperoning.

Heir of Skies
The Starbright Series
Book One

To Stella Victoria, my star.

Chapter One

	The night had never been darker, the blackness surrounding the car, never so suffocating. Even the piles of snow pushed to the sides of the narrow road, did nothing to break up the oppressive darkness. The Stars above, shone brightly, I was sure of it, but they did so from behind a curtain of clouds that blocked the light from reaching the road. I felt swallowed up by emptiness. 
	I gripped the steering wheel tighter, my knuckles stretching until they gleamed white in the glow of the dashboard and my frozen fingers worked numbly against the cold plastic. The headlights of my old Jeep reached only a few feet in front of me and then stopped abruptly against a wall of darkness. I shivered violently, nestling my chin further into the down of my heavy winter coat and cursed the Nebraska winter for being equally as cold as it was desolate. 
	The farmland rolled away from the winding road, buried beneath several feet of iced over snow in every direction. Trees, planted for the privacy of farmers, lined the way home with empty branches and snowcapped tops. My breath puffed out in front of me, fogging up the frozen windshield and reminding me that the heater to my fifteen year old Jeep Cherokee remained unfixed.
	“Tristan!” I growled furiously into the frigid air. “Why I let you talk me into another movie I will never know!” 
	There was no one there to hear my complaints, or sympathize with me against my best friend, but it felt comforting to make noise since I didn’t even have a radio to fill the silence. Still, receiving not even a groan of empathy from the Jeep, I sat forward and peered into the impossible night ahead of me. 
	I knew these roads; I had each curve and turn memorized. The distance between Tristan Shields’ house and my own was well traveled and practically sacred. Still, out in the country where street lights were for city-folk and the deer and the antelope tended to play, their familiar territory became a dangerous, never-ending expanse of nerves and tension. 
	Even in summer, unless the Stars and moon were bright and friendly, the country roads of the Nebraska farmland became shrouded in a heavy obscurity, the headlights of the best of cars mapping out the only visibility in the heavy cloak of night and beyond those flickering lights the world seemed to drop off the edge of a cliff into nothingness. But now, in the dead of winter, with temperatures well below zero, the night around my old Jeep seemed to have a life of its own, oppressive and angry.   
	I cleared my throat and mentally determined to conquer the creeping feeling of being afraid. I bit down on my lower lip and clutched the steering wheel tighter. My breath came out in shaky puffs of air, reminding me it was more than the roads and the night that curdled the most terrified places of my heart. It was more than the late hour and bitter cold that forced me to shiver and shift my eyes suspiciously in every direction.
	It was the Darkness.
	Not the country night, or the moonless sky. But the real Darkness. The Darkness that moved secretly through this world and threatened every living, breathing creature. The Darkness that slithered in unseen places and survived on death and rotten things. The Darkness that I would fight until my dying breath. 
	But not tonight. Tonight I wasn’t ready. Tonight, I was still only sixteen, and my parents were still off saving the galaxy while I stayed home to finish high school with an elderly woman as my babysitter. Yes, even though I was sixteen. When my parents were off planet they insisted I have a mature adult with me at all times.
	Something moved out of the corner of my eye. I could swear it. Swirling my head around, and keeping a steady hold on the steering wheel, I peered into the still night around me, searching out the moving creature. 
	Nothing. 
	Nothing beyond the snow banks piled in the ditches and the swaying lifeless trees that were becoming sparser as I passed expansive fields blanketed under the white of winter. 
	I turned my attention to the road again and with a numb hand, brushed my bright blonde hair under the brim of my stocking cap. My fingers snapped with electricity and for a moment the cab of my Jeep was lit with the sparks of static. Only a few more miles till home. I could make it. There was nothing to be afraid of. 
	But why did tonight feel so different? 
	So dark? 
	And then out of my peripheral vision I saw it move again. A swift shadow sliding effortlessly through the night, riding the whipping wind like a wave and dropping the frozen temperature several degrees lower. The pungent smell of rotting eggs drifted through the air, faint at first and then stronger. 
	I didn’t have to turn my head this time to confirm. I knew it would be gone before I could look in the right direction. Besides, they only existed in the peripheral, in the slight glances and unlit corners or under beds. 
	I had seen them before. Since before I could talk my parents would tell me about them, explain to me of their existence, warn me of their danger. I saw them everywhere, even during the day I could spot them, because they were everywhere.
	Foot soldiers of a greater evil, sent to Earth, the last remaining inhabited planet, to prepare the way for their master. They were the evil in all things, the tyranny, the oppression, the hunger and violence. The Darkness. The force of wickedness that battled against the forces of good with one purpose in mind, to abolish the Light. 
	I was the Light. And because I was the answer to their destruction I cowered further into my winter coat and braved the bone-chilling cold. 
	It should be easy for me to warm up; even in a car with a broken heater it was the natural reaction of my body. I was born of the Light, of the warmth. And to suffer against the natural elements was difficult enough, but with the extra layer of malevolent chill brought on by their nearness the cold became excruciatingly painful even in small doses.
	Still, they couldn’t know what I was. They couldn’t discover me after all this time. At least not yet. So I breathed in the frosty air, feeling the burn in my lungs and the brittleness in my bones and forced myself to push forward a few more miles.  
	My parents worked so hard to hide my existence and to blend in with normal humanity that no matter how easy it would be to relieve my pain, I had to fight against the elements. I was brought to Earth as a baby, with the sole intention to one day take over as Earth’s Protector. And so my parents had given up their positions as two of the greatest Warriors of their generation to raise an alien infant in the middle of farmland. 
	And it was here, in Western Nebraska, that I waited for the day the Earth would become my charge, my responsibility. 
	But that day wasn’t today. I had years before I was supposed to deal with that kind of duty.
	I shivered against the pressing, ominous feeling they knew who I was and then repeated: years…. I promised myself that; made it my mantra. 
	And as soon as I decided these were regular Shadows, which had no idea I was anything special, another one flittered across my peripheral. I swallowed the lump that had taken up an annoying residence in my throat and felt the passenger’s seat for my cell phone. I thought I laid it out before I started the car, but I couldn’t find it. I blindly felt around my worn upholstery and decided it must still be hiding inside my over-sized bag. 
	I strengthened the grip of my left hand and thrust my right hand into the black hole of all my important possessions, hoping to come out successful in three seconds or less. Defender of the last planet or not, I was hopelessly unorganized. My purse was a cluttered mess of unknown objects and somewhere, hidden in the melee was my cell phone. 
	I liked to believe I was brave. Or at least I would be one day. But tonight, all I wanted to do was call Annabelle, my… for lack of a better word, babysitter, wake her up and let her know I would be home in ten minutes, just to hear her reassuring voice. I thought about calling Tristan too and demanding to know why he thought we needed to watch an entire trilogy all in one night. At this point I was scared and nervous and just wanted to blame somebody.
	Lip gloss. Gum. Floss. Wallet. Candy bar…. for emergencies. 
	Where was my cell phone?
	The road was dangerously icy and my constant shivering did nothing to balance out my depth perception. I sucked in a frozen breath and then glanced down at my purse, hoping to be able to spot the phone right away. 
	Not there. 
	At least not right where I could see it in the one point five seconds I allowed myself to look. I heaved an irritated sigh and turned my eyes back to the road. Apparently that second and a half was way too long because standing in the middle of the road was a giant buck, poised and stilled only ten feet away. 
	I panicked. Somewhere in the rational-thinking part of my brain, I knew I was supposed to hit the animal; that it was safer to collide with the deer than slamming on my brakes in the middle of the night on an iced over country road. But my animal-loving instinct took over and my foot pressed furiously against the brake pedal while my hands jerked the steering wheel, yanking it violently to the right.
	The next few seconds became a blur as my Jeep spun wildly out of control without even pretending to slow down. Belatedly I released my foot and tried to pump the brake but it was too late. The tail end flipped around to the front and then the front flipped around again in a screeching circle of skidding tires. I hit the snow bank at an alarming speed before bouncing off in crush of motion that knocked the wind out of me. 
	As if in slow motion, my passenger’s side rammed into the iced over snow bank and then flipped over what felt like several times until I smashed to the frozen field far beyond the road. My Jeep hit the ground with an ear splitting cry of metal crushed against a rock hard surface. 
	I exhaled in a rush of breath, the seatbelt cutting into my awkwardly hanging neck and waist. I felt unconsciousness threatening to sweep me away as the broken bones in my right hand, where it had been crushed between my body and the armrest in the impact, screamed angrily at me. 
	If I were human I would already be unconscious. 
	If I were human, I would have a lot more to worry about than a broken wrist. 
	I wiggled my feet and tried moving my arms, just to make sure there were no other issues. Then I reached over with my left hand and unbuckled the safety restraint. I fell abruptly against the impacted passenger side door and let out a strangled cry of pain.
	I sat up and rubbed my shoulder that now felt displaced but not broken. Climbing into position I bent my knees and braced my hands, one strongly, the other gingerly, against the car around me and thrust my legs forward into the already cracked windshield. 
	The fractured glass moved against the force of my legs, but it took several more tries before I pushed it out completely. When I crawled carefully through the now gaping hole, the windshield remained intact, but definitely fissured. It hung awkwardly across the sideways front hood, still attached near the driver’s side. 
	I slid down the rusted green paint of my Jeep and landed softly and without further injury in the snow. The night was still outside of the crash, silent and subdued. The snow that blanketed the landscape muffled the usual night sounds and the absence of animals, even winter ones, felt eerily dangerous. 
	Out of the corner of my eye I saw one move. A Shadow. The Darkness. 
	But it wasn’t possible. They didn’t know I existed, let alone that I lived here, in the middle of nowhere. I brushed my fear away and simultaneously readied myself for an altercation. I shouldn’t be afraid. I couldn’t be afraid.
	It was actually my job not to be afraid.  
	These were mere minions besides. And even if I wasn’t prepared to go into hand to hand combat with them, if they really knew who I was they would be more afraid of me than I was of them. 
	Or at least that’s what I told myself while the bones in my hand fused back together and my shoulder jerked into place. The healing process was bracingly painful, worse when the bones went back together than when they broke apart in the first place. But it was over quickly and with a sharp intake of breath, a loud snap of bone meeting bone, and a sickening churn in my stomach I was as good as new. 
	I lifted my head in search of the buck that caused all this trouble to begin with but he was nowhere in sight. Either he was frightened off by my car turning in wild circles just to avoid him, or he never existed in the first place, just an apparition that turned to the smoky wisps of evil. 
	But that would mean a purposeful attack. And that couldn’t be. There was just no way they could know who I was. 
	Unless…. Unless, my parents had fallen. 
	I froze for a moment, my hands clenched at my sides, my chest a shallow cavity filled with a heart that refused to beat and lungs that refused to breathe and played through that possibility in my mind. They had been gone for several weeks, on a mission that specifically required their skill set. I hadn’t heard from them since they left, and so it was entirely possible that they failed.
	That they fell. 
	I gazed into the sky, willing the clouds to move out of my way so I could find them. If they were gone, I would be able to tell immediately, their bright lights would be blank in a sky full of their fellow soldiers. The sky was too overcast though, even with my powerful eyesight and ability to cut through darkness, the clouds were too heavy to see through. 
	I cursed uncharacteristically under my breath and then again when I realized my phone was still somewhere unknown in the dark abyss of my Jeep. As I wedged one of my booted feet into the space of my car, where the hood made room for my windshield wipers, I decided that even if my parents were gone, there was no amount of torture or distress that would have prompted them to give up my location. They worked their whole lives to keep me a secret, to prepare me for the day when I would remain here alone, and on top of that, they loved me. There was no way it was them. 
	I ignored the clustering Darkness as I pushed myself up and through the broken windshield, reaching for my spilled purse, whose contents littered the crushed passenger’s side door. The Shadows weren’t trying to hide anymore; they were coming for me, gathering around me as if waiting for the command to attack. I reached down hurriedly, ripping my coat against the rough edges of the broken windshield, but I managed to gather at least the important stuff into my purse before hauling it back with me and hopping down from the Jeep. 
	I tossed the purse that now only held my wallet and cellphone and a few random items that managed to survive the spill, onto the snowy ground and lifted my head to meet my enemy. They moved around me like a slow tornado of darkness. As separate entities they appeared like slender gusts of black wind, but united they became a solid wall of evil. Even my keen eye sight could not see through them, or my superheated blood feel anything beyond their oppressive iciness. 
	I had never seen so many Shadows in one place. I had never even heard of them organizing themselves into a unified attack. They worked separately and secretly; their purpose was to influence mankind, to spread the Darkness like a disease to every corner of this planet, not to outright attack it. The deer had to be them. And even in that instance, their work was not so much of a surprise. But surrounding me now was something so unheard of that I was more taken aback than actually frightened. 
	The wall of Darkness moved against me, tightening its spaces and obviously trying to threaten me. I remained frozen, unwilling to reveal my identity even in this frontal attack. I wished more than anything that my parents were here, on planet and nearby. But obviously this was a battle I would have to fight or figure out how to outmaneuver alone. 
	One Shadow broke free from the wall and moved against me in an aggressive sweep. It sliced against my thigh before I could react, tearing my jeans where it made contact. My skin burned from the unreal cold that I could feel to the marrow of my bones. The slash spread out its icy tendrils across my leg and moved upward throughout my body in scary quickness. I felt my lungs tighten against the strain of the cold and my appendages go numb from contact. My first instinct was to cry out in pain, but I bit my cheek, willing myself quiet and for the first time thankful that my lungs held no air to expel. 
	I couldn’t see beneath my layers of clothes, but I had been educated enough to know that my skin would be marked with the deathly blue lines that looked like raised, swollen veins from my skin and spread out in fingerlike vines until every inch of my body was covered in them. It was at that point, when contact with the Darkness covered every inch of my body that a human would breathe their last painful, staggered breath and never breathe again. It would take less than thirty seconds, but in that short time was more pain than should ever accompany a soul on their way to the afterlife. 
	The smell of sulfur burned my nostrils and made my ears ring from the pain of it. I wasn’t human. And I wouldn’t die from this contact. But I felt it more strongly than any human ever could. This touch, this evil, was in direct opposition to everything I was. As dark and evil as the Shadows were, I was light and goodness. As painful as their touch could be, mine was healing and soothing.
I made a split second decision, putting the pain aside. I decided, rationally, that I couldn’t stay out of this fight. The wall of Darkness surrounding me was waiting for me to die. If I was human, like I was trying to play off, I should be lying on the ground right now, writhing in pain. Even as I stood against the misery, I knew they already figured it out.
	My parents hadn’t even started with weapons training yet, beyond the casual swing of a sword and so I was left with only one option. Unfortunately it was also the option that would give this Darkness exactly what they were looking for: the answer to my identity. 
	I was a Star.
	And not just any Star. The next Protector of Earth. I was a very important Star.
	As fast as I could, I unzipped my heavy coat and flung it from my arms. I moved into a battle ready stance and let the warmth, the warmth I had hidden deep inside me, bubble to the surface. My golden toned skin met my internal heat welcomingly and it spread across my body as quickly as a wildfire in a drought. Immediately that took away my pain and warmed me completely. I lifted my head skyward, and let the light leave my skin, pouring outward into the heavy obscurity around me. 
	I couldn’t help but smile as my true essence found form in the night. I glowed, literally. Blinding, supernatural, burning light radiated around me until my human form was almost completely hidden. Heat and light left me in waves of self-protection, the Darkness desperately fled from my presence and my light that would cause them as much pain as their cold blackness caused me.
	The smell of sulfur grew stronger for only a moment as my inner light singed some of the stragglers; they shrieked an ear-piercing sound, discordant and inhuman. And then they took to the sky in an urgent escape from a battle they were hardly prepared for.
	I smiled wider; calling back the blinding light into my body and reducing my essence to a slight outward shimmer. I reached down for my coat and slipped it back on, not bothering with the zipper. I didn’t really need the warmth now; the heat that lived inside of me was more than enough to keep me warm, but I also didn’t want to attract anymore Shadows. 
	Even without the Darkness clouding the landscape, with the absence of my supernatural light the night felt extra dark. I couldn’t wait to get home and to bed now that this little skirmish was over, but with my car upturned I needed to call Tristan to come get me. He wouldn’t be happy when I dragged him out of bed, but his grandmother and my caretaker, Annabelle, couldn’t drive at all, let alone come get me in the middle of the night. But I was still trying to blame this whole thing on him anyway, so I didn’t feel guilty.
	Just as I reached for my phone, a single shot of light came careening through the atmosphere and stopped suddenly somewhere high above me, concealed by the thick cloud cover. I lifted my head, expecting my parents and when the light moved into two separate lights I grew even more hopeful. One light dimmed to nothing though, and I couldn’t be sure what that meant. 
That couldn’t be right. My parents wouldn’t extinguish their light before they reached the ground. 
	They couldn’t, it wasn’t possible.
	The sounds of crashing metal as it sliced the air grabbed my attention. I squinted, frustrated with the clouds for the millionth time tonight and searched through the heavy gray for some sign of what was happening. The sky directly above my head glowed in bursts of brighter light like an intense lightning storm. When the sounds of terrified screeching and the horrid smell of sulfur burned my nostrils again, I realized the light was a fellow Warrior. 
	But it was definitely not my parents.
	The sounds of battle continued for several more minutes, as I remained rooted on the ground. I couldn’t join the fight since I was weaponless, so I had to assume it was my side winning by the sounds of weapons cutting through putrid flesh and the pained, high-pitched wailing of Shadows. 
	Eventually the battle died down, the flashes of light narrowing into one form, the sounds of shrieking diminishing. I didn’t know what to expect as the light darted in a fast line to my right and then shot from overhead to just a few feet in front of me. 
	A human would have needed to cover their sensitive eyes from the extraordinary brightness a fellow Star illuminated. But not being human, my eyes were made of the same light and so I just watched on with impatient anticipation to discover who was here to clean up my mess.
	Out of the light, one figure walked forward, dim and obviously not a Star. When he was close enough that I could determine he was a man, an elderly man with snow white hair and leathered skin, I took a step back, unsure what to make of this gruff human looking person apparently with the ability to fly and see Shadows, making him decidedly not human. I shrunk into my coat, having the forbidding feeling I was about to be reprimanded. 
	“Stella Day?” He demanded, stepping directly in front of me. I nodded, unexplainably more afraid of him than the entire force of Darkness. “What in this great, dead Universe, do you think you’re doing?”
	“Who are you?” I deflected meekly. If he came to fight the Darkness, surely he saw me attacked only minutes ago. 
	“Does it matter who I am?” the elderly man huffed. His dark brow drew down over bushy white eyebrows. “I could just as easily be Lucifer himself or any of the Fallen called here by your own stupidity! How could you reveal yourself like that? You gave yourself away! After all we’ve worked for, after all the sacrifices that have been made, you just threw it all away because you were a little inconvenienced one winter night….” He stopped talking to me, or at least stopped looking at me, in favor of mumbling to himself in an angry, aggressive tone. 
	“I’m sorry,” I tried again politely, “Who are you?” 
	“I’m the guy that just saved your life, little Starling! That’s who!” He turned his attention wholly back on me. 
	I took an intimidated step back.
	“Well, not entirely on your own,” a rumbly, amused voice called. “You did have some help.” The light had extinguished itself into its human form, and as he stepped around the angry man to smile disarmingly at me, I took another step back but this time more from surprise than anything else. He was perfect, physically perfect. He was my age, with disheveled dark hair that curled adorably at the ends. His eyes were a piercing shade of honey that would have glowed without his internal light. But now, fresh from battle they pierced through the night and found my eyes with a locking force that took my breath away. His jawline seemed chiseled out of stone and his broad chest still heaved with the exertion of the fight. 
	There was no doubt about it, he was an Angel.
	An actual Angel. 
	My Star Counterpart.
	“No, not on my own, but we wouldn’t even need to be here if it weren’t for her,” the elderly man continued to grumble.
	I knew I should be offended after that comment, but I was so confused all I could do was look back and forth between them. 
	“Where are your parents, Starling?” the old man suddenly demanded.
	“Uh, they’re uh, they’re on a mission,” I stammered, wondering if they would ever tell me who they were. “They’ve been gone for a couple weeks.” 
	“Of course…. then this was a well-planned attack. They’ve been waiting for this,” He mumbled in an “Aha-Moment” kind of voice.
	“Please tell me who you are,” I dropped my voice to hide my desperation. 
	“Oh right, I suppose it’s too late now to go back.” The elderly man turned his full attention on me and for the first time I noticed the color of his eyes were a dull red, as if they shined bright like rubies at one time but were worn down with age or exhaustion. “I’m Jupiter, your weapons trainer, and this is Seth. He’s your Counterpart. You obviously weren’t supposed to meet for years yet, but tonight you decided to push up our schedule.”
	“I didn’t mean to!” I blurted, suddenly feeling very guilty for saving my own life. “They attacked me. They came out of nowhere and they just…. ganged up on me! Honestly, I didn’t have a choice.”
	“Then they must have known already,” Jupiter sighed and lifted his hands to massage his temples with surprisingly delicate fingers.
	“That’s what I thought,” I agreed, finally feeling as though I had been heard. “But wait a second, why are you here? Where is the Protector? Why isn’t she here to save me?” Realization flooded my thoughts with questions that I should have been asking from the beginning.
	“You are the Protector, Stella,” Seth answered gently.
	I opened my mouth to argue but Jupiter cut in quickly, “Sidra is dead. We found her earlier this evening. She was murdered.” 
	“And her Counterpart?” I gasped, not able to completely comprehend the gravity of what they were saying.
	“Nisroc was murdered right along with her,” Jupiter replied in a barely audible voice.
	“So that really does make me….” I couldn’t finish my thought. I could barely hear them anymore as the world seemed to close in around me. My heart pounded out a deafening beat that heated my eardrums and seemed to shrink my lungs. 
	“The Protector of Earth,” Jupiter finished gravely.

Chapter Two

	I stumbled backwards and bumped into my totaled Jeep. Suddenly the effort to stand felt too strenuous and I began to sink down to the frozen ground, wondering if the world would ever stop spinning
	Before I could make it all the way down, Seth reached for my arm and steadied me. His hands were solid against me and I felt the warmth of his inner light radiating through my thick coat. I looked up at him, studying his muscular jaw and angular cheek bones, instinctively leaning in to feel the heat of his light. His eyes were wide and piercing, the concern he felt for me shooting through the darkness and penetrating the numbing haze that seemed to settle around me. 
	We were partners. Counterparts. He was the Warrior and I was the Protector. I protected the Earth and he protected me. We would spend the rest of our lives together, side by side, our good versus their evil, fighting for the lives of the entire human race. And yet we weren’t supposed to meet this young. 
	This responsibility wasn’t supposed to belong to us yet. 
	“Well, stand up child!” Jupiter demanded. “We can’t have the Star of Earth cowering on the ground! There are spies everywhere; it is time to claim your destiny!” This time when Jupiter spoke there was a gleam in his eye, a glint of excitement that I found aggressive, almost dangerous. 
	I felt myself weaken again at the call to my fate. I had known since childhood that one day I would inherit this planet and yet now that I faced the reality of my call, I couldn’t help but convince myself how ill-prepared I was. My parents had trained me in many ways, but the important stuff, the practical training had been pushed to a later date in favor of high school. 
“You can ignore all that destiny stuff if you want to,” Seth murmured quietly into my ear, the low timber of his voice vibrating against my earlobe. “But it only gets worse with time; it’s easiest just to agree with him.”
“Right,” I agreed, feeling only half awake. “I mean, of course. This is the day I’ve been training for.”
“Training? Ha!” Jupiter exclaimed. “From the little stunt you pulled tonight, it doesn’t look like you’ve been doing much training at all! Where are your weapons? Why didn’t you at least use a sword?”
“Um….” I knew there would be no getting around this explanation, or admitting my lack of weapons experience, still Jupiter was making me super nervous. “I don’t have any weapons with me,” I improvised.
“Why not?” Jupiter howled.
“Because, I didn’t think I would need them?” I finished weakly.
“Is that a question?” Jupiter snapped.
“No?” I realized that wasn’t a very strong response either.   	
Seth let out a chuckle, his shoulders shaking with humor. But then he looked down at me as if I was fragile and delicate and I felt something grow between us. Something I couldn’t yet define. Wisps of my golden blonde hair escaped from my bulky stocking cap and moved gently in the wind as if defying the angry cold night, they blew across my face, tickling my nose. 
I stared at Seth, waiting for him to explain the crazy man glaring at me like I’d invited this trouble into my life. Even though I promised myself Jupiter meant no harm…. well, not real harm anyway, maybe just some slight emotional trauma. I saw Seth respond, watched as his eyes changed from sympathy to determination, I felt his protectiveness over me grow into something fierce and powerful, like a physical extension of himself.
There wasn’t love between us. Obviously we just met. But he was my Counterpart and whether it was a supernatural calling to stand beside me and guard me from anything potentially threatening, or if it was his own attraction to our supernatural bond, I couldn’t tell. But I felt the roots of his protection firmly make a home inside my heart. Roots that neither Heaven nor Hell could remove. We were bonded; even in these few seconds of being together the eternal connection was already there.  
“You didn’t think you would need them?” Jupiter spat; his face was growing redder by the second until it finally matched the dullish color of his eyes. “Of course you need weapons! You always need weapons! Surely your parents have gone over that with you.”
	“Well, not exactly….” I started, more afraid of Jupiter than ever. I felt myself lean into Seth for security. I knew he was my destined partner, the one that would stand by me in battle, his very life devoted to keeping me safe. Just being near him was comforting, gave me the courage I needed to come clean with Jupiter. “We haven’t actually gotten to weapons yet.” 
	“You haven’t what?” Jupiter whisper-shouted. His face as tomato-red as possible, his voice sounding like he was choking on rage. “No wonder you lit up like a lantern! Oh, Callisto, this cannot be happening to me!”
	“Callisto?” I repeated and then turned my questioning gaze to Seth.
	“It’s one of Jupiter’s moons,” Seth explained in a calm whisper.
	“He has his own moons?” I gasped.
	“No, Jupiter, like the planet Jupiter,” Seth laughed. 
	“Oh….” I shook my head. I had the distinct feeling I was behind in a lot more than weapons training.
	“So you haven’t been prepared with any kind of sword?” Jupiter repeated and I nodded wearily. “Ok, have you had any kind of training?” 
	I shook my head furiously, excited to answer his question and opened my mouth to reply, but Jupiter cut me off quickly with a clarification, “Physical training?”
	“Well, yes. I mean, my parents and I… Since the whole purpose of being raised on Earth was to get to know humanity and all, well, we decided that I should play sports.” I finished matter of fact expecting to get at least a nod of approval from him, but the look of disbelief that narrowed his eyes and turned his facial muscles to stone caused me to take a step back out of fear instead.
	“Sports? As in…. what do you mean sports?” Jupiter demanded.
“Sports, you know, like, uh, high school sports.” I answered a little less confidently. 
“High school sports?” Jupiter repeated as if it were the most insane thing he had ever heard. “Which ones?”
	“Um, all of them…. Volleyball, basketball, soccer.... In the summer I’m in a running club,” I tried to sound enthusiastic about my experience, but I was positive, at this point, nothing would redeem me in Jupiter’s eyes. 
	“God must hate me….” Jupiter sighed, tilting his head back so that he stared hopelessly into the still-clouded sky.	
	“Jupiter….” Seth warned in a voice that held the first sound of true rationality all night. “We should probably take Stella home. It’s late, and we can discuss the rest of this in the morning.” 	
	After a charged minute of contemplation, Jupiter agreed. “Yes, you’re right.” And then to me, “When will your parents be home, Starling? I will want to discuss most of this with them,” Jupiter’s tone was calmer, more patient, but his dullish eyes were still burning with frustration. Even in the darkness I could see how they flashed with synapses of a brighter red.
I wanted him to be more careful with me, to realize that I was dealing with an overwhelming revelation tonight. Things had spiraled into chaos so quickly that yelling seemed the only way for him to grapple back the reigns of control. But I couldn’t ask him to be gentle or pacifying. It wasn’t his attitude that needed to change, it was mine. I was the one who was cowering, afraid of the future and what tonight meant. Jupiter was right. I should have been better prepared.  
	“Sometime tomorrow night, or the following morning,” I explained, finally taking a big breath at the mention of going home. 
	“All right, that will do. Seth and I will need to stay with you. I’m sure you have enough room for us, especially if you’re staying there alone right now,” Jupiter explained to me as if I wouldn’t naturally come up with the idea on my own.
	“Well, there is plenty of room,” I agreed and then continued carefully, “But I’m not staying there alone. My parents hire a woman to watch over me whenever they leave on a mission.”
	There was another one of those charged pauses where I could physically feel Jupiter reigning in his temper. “Are you telling me there is a human woman staying with you, receiving compensation, in order to…. protect you?” Jupiter’s amazement with the backward way my family operated continued to grow every time I opened my mouth. “Is she a police officer, or part of the military?”
	“Uh, no….” I continued reluctantly, “She’s my best friend’s grandmother.”
	Jupiter couldn’t have responded to that if he wanted to. I watched the red color of his face turn to an eggplant purple and his cheeks puff out as he worked deliberately to keep his mouth shut tight. Next to me, Seth shook into good-humored laughter as he watched his mentor become more and more flustered.  
	“Pick up the car, Seth, we wouldn’t want Stella’s guardian to begin to worry and do something dangerous like break a hip,” Jupiter grumbled angrily, which only caused Seth to laugh harder. 
	I stood in shocked silence for a few minutes, feeling the righteous outrage for one of the most beloved people in my life. When I could finally reply I was just short of outraged, “And how old are you? Seth and I should be just as worried about you breaking one of your hips!”
	“I am not an old human, child. I am in no danger of one of my bones breaking!” Jupiter snapped and then walked around the Jeep to wait impatiently for Seth to join him. 
	“He’s not human? And he’s not an Angel?” I looked to Seth for an explanation; he was just getting his laughter under control.
	“Can’t you guess where he’s from?” Seth smiled down at me. I was really starting to grow attached to the way his eyes sparkled with life when he looked at me, and how he gave me his absolute and undivided attention. “He’s from Jupiter. Before the Darkness took his home, that’s where he lived.”
	“He named himself after his dead planet?” I barely stopped myself from rolling my eyes.
	“Something about humans not possessing the right vocabulary to pronounce his real name,” Seth explained dryly and then answered Jupiter’s incessant demand for help on the other side of the Jeep.
	I jumped out of the way when I realized they really were going to try to right the Jeep and drive it home. What a night! My whole life had just changed in the matter of forty five minutes and as I watched my new tutor and Counterpart flip my Jeep, I couldn’t help but shiver at the reminder of the new path my life would now take. 
	I knew this day was coming. 
	I just didn’t expect it to happen so soon.

----

	I pulled into my long gravel driveway still a little amazed, but mostly amused that Seth was able to right the Jeep and get it running again. The antique rumbled unhappily along the quiet country roads, but it managed to make it all the way home without completely falling apart. Although, I couldn’t even pretend I didn’t hear pieces of my beloved vehicle dropping off along the way.
	And because of the damaged windshield I was grateful for my supernatural eyesight. 
	At least the Jeep was ruined because of a near death experience…. that at least gave me some explanation to offer to my frugal father. 
	I hopped down from the cab and walked quietly to the back door of the old farm house I called home. In my parents attempt to blend into humanity, my father had taken up farming a long time ago. So like most families in this particular middle of Nebraska region, we lived on acres of property, miles from our neighbors and even farther from town. Well, we lived miles from the one stop light, bank and bar we called town. We lived a full hour from real civilization.
	Oh, there was a gas station too.
	That had to count for something. 
	Seth and Jupiter followed me inside the house, careful to remain silent. They had both stayed relatively quiet after the Jeep was righted, the fatigue of battle and the late hour wearing even them down. 
	“I should tell Annabelle you’re here, so you don’t give her a heart attack in the morning,” I whispered. I regretted my phrasing when Jupiter snorted in disgust.  
I led them out of the mud room into the kitchen and turned on the light. Seth’s eyes immediately fell on the refrigerator and he took an excited step forward before stopping himself. 
“Stella?” I turned from the staircase that led up from the kitchen, an old servant’s hall from back when this farm had things like…. servants. “Do you mind if I….?” he gestured to the refrigerator and widened his eyes in anticipation. 
“Help yourself,” I smiled down at him, happy he wasn’t awkward about the new arrangement. His grin spread across his face and his honey colored eyes sparkled with gratefulness.  
I climbed the steps wearily, wondering how I would explain this to Annabelle. Wondering how I would explain it to anybody! I knew what this meant. I knew that the death of the Protector meant it would be my turn to step up. That also meant that Seth would become a permanent, every day fixture in my life. 
I didn’t necessarily mind that, we seemed to have the natural, friendly chemistry that was born between a Star and Warrior. We had been destined to get along before either of us was even born, chosen by the Elders to protect this planet together. We didn’t have much choice, or say in the pairing. Our personalities would complement each other the same way our fighting skills would, the same way our unique, supernatural powers would. 
Still, there was supposed to be years before we met, before I had to face the promise between us. I had a life to live, high school to finish. And as solidly as my destiny was rooted in my heart, so was the desire to be a normal, carefree teenager for just a few more years. 
Stupid evil. Stupid Darkness for ruining my life.
Standing in front of the guest bedroom, I shook my head and squared my shoulders. I was complaining, whining about circumstances that couldn’t be changed. The truth was I wasn’t a normal anything. I wasn’t even a normal Star. I was the Protector of Earth and wanting and wishing were not going to get me anywhere. 
I twirled a loose end of hair around my pointer finger for a few seconds; still trying to find the right frame of mind and then lifted my arms to jerk them across my chest, successfully popping my shoulders. The movement felt good, an old habit from volleyball and something I was positive no other Star in the entire universe practiced. 
Another quick breath and I knocked quietly on Annabelle’s door before turning the handle and letting myself inside. Annabelle had watched me from my first year of life, every time my parents went out of town. She was as much a part of my family as anyone else and the main reason Tristan and I had become such good friends. 
“Annabelle….” I whispered, knowing she was a light sleeper. She stirred under a heavy quilt that she, herself, had made for my mom, and groaned something indecipherable. “Annabelle….” I whispered louder and this time Annabelle lifted her head off her pillow and brushed gray curls away from her face. 
“What is it child?” Annabelle asked, immediately concerned. Her soft, wrinkled face peered at me through the dark, her gray eyes filled with concern. 
“I’m sorry to wake you,” I tried to quickly explain so I wouldn’t worry her. “I’m late coming home because some old friends of our family surprised me tonight by coming to town and I had to meet them so I could bring them here,” I explained, using half lies and rambling. I generally didn’t like to hide any truth, lying was one of those things I just could not stand. I had even explained to Tristan a long time ago exactly who I was and why, at certain times…. I glowed, just so we could continue our friendship without any secrets. “They are staying with us for a while. There are two of them, Jupiter is your age and Seth, his uh…. grandson. He’s my age. Anyway, I’ll let you get back to sleep; I just didn’t want you to freak out in the morning.” 
“All right, child. Your parents should be home tomorrow anyway. Get to sleep now,” she admonished before rolling over in bed. Her robust frame caused the double bed to creak beneath her and as I slipped out the bedroom door I could hear her mutter, “What kind of name is Jupiter?”
I laughed to myself as I made my way back down the servant stairs. I paused in the hallway to adjust the heat, noticing how cold Annabelle’s bedroom had been. My parents and I had to be particularly careful about the temperature of our house when human guests were over because when our powers were not restricted, our internal warmth kept us comfortable. Sometimes, in the winter, it would be several nights in a row before we noticed the frost on the inside of our windows. My father loved how low we could keep our heating costs. 
In the kitchen Jupiter and Seth sat eating left over potato cheese soup Annabelle made for dinner making happy murmurs of approval. I got myself a glass of water before joining them at the table. As much as I longed to find my bed right now, I knew there were still things that needed to be discussed.
“This is so good!” Seth declared, lifting his eyes from the soup to mine, proving how in love with the soup he really was. His golden brown eyes were sparkling and his whole body humming with approval. “Usually we eat…. I don’t know what we eat, but it is never as good as this.”
“You’re certainly not starved, boy,” Jupiter grunted. I laughed at what had clearly been an insult to Jupiter’s culinary skills. 
“Annabelle is an amazing cook,” I agreed, knowing what it was like to not eat this good on a regular basis. Stars weren’t exactly born domestic and although my mom tried to familiarize herself with the kitchen, things usually ended…. interesting. And since we lived so far out in the country, take-out was almost never an option. Although the gas station did have hot pizza. Not good pizza. But most the time it was hot.
Jupiter made another grunting nose, but continued to shovel the spoon from soup to mouth without slowing down. I sat quietly while the two of them finished their late night meal. They stayed absorbed in their soup, so I had the opportunity to study them under light. 
Jupiter was old. Not just by human standards, although I knew the human eye wouldn’t place him later than seventy, but old…. really old. I could tell. I could also feel how other-worldly he was now that I spent some time with him. 
As if the fact that he could fly wasn’t a big enough clue that he wasn’t from around here…. 
My ability to detect the nature of someone’s essence had been with me since birth, but this was really the first opportunity I had to use it other than occasional Shadow that crossed my path. I couldn’t place his exact age, but it was definitely old, hundreds of years old. And he definitely wasn’t human, although other than the dull red of his eyes, he appeared to be Homo-Sapien in every other way. His tanned skin was wrinkled and weathered and his gray hair fell in disheveled short tufts of a bad-hair-cut meets impossible-to-tame-horse-hair.
	Even without ever hearing him talk, I could have assumed he was a tough man, and that had nothing to do with my ability to feel out the foreign. He had deep frown lines, and his permanent scowl wouldn’t invite any stranger into a random conversation. He wasn’t exactly a physically imposing man, just a few inches taller than me and probably barely making six feet, but his very presence was intimidating. I could bet most humans ran from him as quickly as they could, and suddenly I felt a deep pang for the humanity I had come to love. Whatever happened to Jupiter’s home planet, I wasn’t sure Earth deserved him as punishment. 
	Seth on the other hand was the very opposite, and not just in age. He was the kind of guy that strangers would trust to hold their babies or the police would ask to be a witness in a crime even if he were holding a gun and covered in blood. His dark hair was unruly and wild, but his amber colored eyes were inviting and soulful. His smile reached from ear to ear and the angular shape of his face didn’t exactly scream out trustworthy, but it did cast him in such a way any woman would toss caution to the wind and throw themselves at him. 
	I couldn’t help but smile at him. His golden-toned skin, his muscular body, his carefree recklessness…. I didn’t have many feelings for him yet, but one that shone brighter than the others resonated as pride. I was proud to have him as my Counterpart. Already I could tell that I could trust him, and not just in battle. Plus, saving my life once already definitely spoke volumes about our future together. 
	Our, uh, professional future together. Not the other future…. that I wasn’t exactly ready to think about yet.
	“So, when your parents get back, we will discuss finding our own place,” Jupiter broke the silence after scraping his bowl clean and giving a tentative glance back at a Tupperware still half full of soup. “Until then, I think it will be safer if we stay with you. If more Shadows come to find you, it will be better if we’re with you, especially with your…. questionable training.” 
	I smiled at his polite way of referencing my actual lack of training, I felt like that was as nice as he was going to get. I wasn’t embarrassed of my lack of skills though. Even if tomorrow I faced an army of the Darkness, I wouldn’t regret the life I’d lived so far. Experience had to count for something. And I had plenty of life experience. Well, at least sixteen years of it.
	“Will it be hard for you to move?” I looked to Seth, wondering if he was as regretful about leaving typical high school life behind him as I was.
	“No, why would it be?” his expressive eyes turned curious and his spoon suspended itself midway to his mouth.	
	“Oh, I didn’t know if you were leaving behind a lot of friends or something,” I tried to explain without looking at Jupiter, but heard his mocking grunt and couldn’t help but turn to him. 
	“Unlike you, Seth has focused on his training, real training. We chose to abstain from unnecessary human interactions,” Jupiter explained in the most condescending voice I had ever heard.
	Seth set his spoon down, ready to stand up to his mentor. I could see how he respected Jupiter more than anyone else in the universe, but there was also the overbearing instinct to protect me. I knew he felt it because I felt it, like the hottest, most honest kind of liquid truth running through my veins. It was consuming and bonding at the same time.  
Seth shot a warning glance at Jupiter that sent the message he wouldn’t stand for any more. The look of pride and slight excitement Jupiter returned with was surprising, but I wondered if Jupiter had been goading Seth to see if he could get some kind of reaction like this, just to make sure the tie between us existed. Plus, I suspected Jupiter was always looking for a good fight. 
	No other Star and Counterpart had been raised the way Seth and I had. Usually, they grew up together, paired since early childhood from a natural bond. The Elders watched every Warrior child’s training closely and paired them with a Star accordingly. 
But our case was different. Hell, our case was an experiment. As Earth remained the sole planet with sustainable life left in the galaxy, the Elders decided it was time to try a different tactic than the millenniums of tradition that dictated our way of life. They decided Seth and I would be raised on Earth, with humans, immersed in the culture and able to call the planet we protected home. Because of the danger of living not only amongst humans, but also surrounded by the Darkness, it was decided to keep us separated for the sake of secrecy until the time when we would take over the planet together. 
	The Elders had relied on destiny and the natural order of our way to keep the bond between Star and Counterpart intact. It was a risky thing to do. Not meeting each other until the night of battle could have had dire effects, a team not willing to bond, or able to get along. But as Seth gazed across the table at me, filled with the same fierce desire to lay down his life for me that I had for him, I knew they gambled with success. 
	“What about school?” I asked him, pulling him away from his soup again.
	“Oh, Jupiter and I just did that in between training sessions,” Seth shrugged.
	“You were homeschooled?” I gasped, and then slapped my hand over my mouth. “Jupiter, how is homeschooling immersing Seth into humanity?” I couldn’t help but ask, while trying to hide my amusement.
	I wasn’t sure where exactly Seth and Jupiter had come from before tonight, but I decided wherever it was had deprived not only Seth of a high school experience, but some random teenage girls as well. Shouldn’t all high schools have an unattainable heart throb Angel walking the halls? Laughter bubbled over and I dipped my head so I wouldn’t have to explain that concept to Seth.
	“Obviously your parents and I have different methods,” Jupiter replied coolly. “I wouldn’t exactly call contact sports weapons training after all. The ability to dribble a basketball did nothing to save your skin tonight.” 
	I took his point and settled down a bit.
	“We can talk more about this tomorrow, when your parents get home,” Jupiter instructed. “Where will we sleep tonight?” 
	“There is a guest bedroom down the hall for you,” I addressed Jupiter, not really knowing the state of his fragility or old age, even though he did just flip a Jeep. “And Seth, there’s another room downstairs that you can have. I’m told it’s freezing and kind of creepy down there when you’re alone, but hopefully none of that will bother you.” I smiled at him, but he only looked at me curiously. 
	“I don’t get cold,” he answered matter of fact.
	“No, I know you don’t. It was a joke….” I sighed; apparently it was too late at night to be a comedian. “I can walk you down there if you’re ready. And Jupiter, help yourself to more soup; when I get back, I’ll take you to your room.” 
	I stood and Seth followed. I walked to the hallway and opened the old wooden door that led downstairs. My basement had been finished years ago, but it was still an old farmhouse basement. I wasn’t supposed to scare easily; my job expected me to be brave, courageous… to laugh in the face of danger…. required it actually. And usually I did. But even if the cold, dampness of the basement didn’t bother me, there was something about being down there, underground and without direct access to sunlight that did. 
	I opened the guest bedroom that sat off the rec room and turned on the light for Seth. “The bedding is fresh and there are toothbrushes and toothpaste in the drawer in the bathroom. I think they’re all new….” I tried to remember if anyone had been down here recently. Sometimes my parents housed Stars or Warriors passing through, and that’s why there were so many guest bedrooms and such a huge house for just the three of us. “There’s a shower in the bathroom too, with soap and shampoo and all that stuff. The towels are in the cabinet next to it.” 
	“Thanks,” Seth turned to me. He had been eyeing the bedroom carefully, marking a fast escape route through the small window and checking for anything abnormal. Actually, he had been checking for Shadows since I met him. Even though a Star’s house was technically blessed, he didn’t seem to trust anything or take anything at face value. I wondered if he was just paranoid or if some event in his life had hardened this part of him. 
	“I wish I had clothes or something for you to change into. Tomorrow, I’ll go through my dad’s things and see what I can find,” I promised. 
	“Yeah, I won’t need anything till tomorrow anyway,” Seth smiled, his big, wide grinning smile and started to take off his shoes. “Hey Stella….” 
	I looked up into his guarded, careful eyes and suddenly I was nervous for whatever he was going to say. “Yeah?”
	“Listen, we don’t have to…. I mean…. there’s no pressure between us,” he stammered and an instant wave of relief washed over me at the same time my cheeks heated with an embarrassed blush. “I’m not expecting you to like be my girlfriend or anything. I just want to get to know you. You know, be friends first,” he smiled confidently and I mimicked his expression.
	I did know.
	“Oh thank God,” I relaxed against the door jamb. “I feel the same way! No pressure.” I nodded my head enthusiastically and his eyes twinkled at me from across the room. “We’ve got like eight years anyway, right?”
	“Uh, yeah, eight years….” Seth suddenly looked uncomfortable and I instantly wanted to retract my time line. Maybe he was hoping to postpone our “relationship” even longer than that. 
	I almost told him he could have even longer than that but decided to change the subject from awkward to more common ground, “Well, thanks again for tonight,” I moved away from the door, realizing he was starting to undress and I needed to give him some privacy. “You probably saved my life.” 
	“Hey, it’s what I’m here for,” Seth’s eyes turned very serious for a second and then he tugged his shirt off. I couldn’t take him seriously anymore. Golden skin pulled tight against a perfectly chiseled chest. Every one of his muscles rippled with his movements from his thick, gorgeous neck down across every singly defined abdominal muscle. I fought against the urge to stop, stare and ogle him until my eyes glazed over and walked out of the room. 
	I closed the door behind me, laughing again and shaking my head. 
	Mead High School wasn’t going to know what hit it when that boy walked through the doors.

Chapter Three

	The beep of my phone woke me early the next day…. too early. I groaned and rolled over in bed. The early morning sun streamed through the window above my headboard, bathing me in natural warmth; I lay there for a moment soaking in the sun, enjoying the exhilaration of light. 
	I knew the truth about Stars, about the Earth’s sun, I had even met her once. Yet, I couldn’t help but smile into the warming light and breathe in the peaceful morning slowly. Even if that was a comrade up there, a fellow Star in arms, she was still heating this Earth with every bit of warmth she possessed and I decided to enjoy it. 
	My phone beeped again, a reminder of why I woke up. Although I knew exactly who it would be, the only person who would dare text me this early in the day. Not even my parents would risk a text message before eight. 
	Did you get home Ok?
A lot of good this text does now…. I quipped back to Tristan. I wasn’t quite sure how to tell him the truth over text message, best to defer with sarcasm. 
	I’ll assume that’s a yes then. 
	I made it home. “Ok” is still up for debate…. I couldn’t help myself but make him feel a little bit bad. I didn’t really blame Tristan at all for what happened last night, I knew without a shadow of a doubt that what happened was a well-planned attack and would have happened no matter what time I drove home. Probably, the late hour kept potential human drivers from getting hurt or involved. Still… Tristan deserved a little bit of a guilt trip.
	Are you really Ok? Seriously, Stella…. I can come over if you need me.
	Yes, I’m fine. You don’t need to come over. I’ll explain later. Are we still on for a run later? I knew that text message would only worry Tristan further. He tended to be a tad overprotective. But this was a face to face conversation; acronyms and emoticons explaining the events of last night would only lead to more confusion and panic. And possibly to Tristan waging war against the Darkness himself…. 
	Don’t come over…? Someone else over there? 
	Something like that…. Run later? I couldn’t lie to him. 
	That’s it, I’m coming over. 
	Tristan!!!! I will explain everything later, but in order to do that you have to go for a run with me!! Growing exasperated, I used the only tool I had to get his attention: exclamation points. 
	Fine. Yes, a run. Break into the school gym?
	Sounds good. Now, I’m going to go force your grandma to make me chocolate chip pancakes. I tried to turn the conversation light again. 
	I swear you want me to come over there….
	Stop it. I’m still in my pajamas. 
What are you doing to me!?! 
See you at 2. Oh that boy.
	Later.
	I sighed, a happy smile finding my lips. Tristan. He was something else, my closest friend and most exasperating life experience. But Earth wouldn’t be the same without him. I couldn’t wait to introduce him to Seth, especially if Seth was planning on starting school after winter break. 
	School.
	Would I even be going to school after winter break? An uneasy feeling crept into my belly. I hadn’t really felt all that attached to high school before last night, but now the thought of giving it up, the idea of moving on with my life already felt so… final. So… depressing. 
	With another sigh, only this one sounding more disgruntled and angry than happy, I threw the covers off and sat up in bed. With men downstairs, it was probably a good idea to get dressed before breakfast. That would mean a bra. Definitely a bra. Although a part of me rebelled against the idea of wearing anything but sweats while eating chocolate chip pancakes, I didn’t see much other choice. 
	Just like my future.
	Ok, get a grip. 
	I was being absolutely ridiculous about the whole thing. Whatever happened would be for the best, I believed that, it was just easy to forget and I didn’t want to wallow in self-pity. That wasn’t who I was, or who I was born to be. 
	Besides, I didn’t actually know anything for certain and I wasn’t going to get any answers staring into my closet, willing them to appear. 
	With a final, determined decision to face whatever the next step of my life was going to be with a good attitude, I stood up and walked into my narrow walk-in closet. I chose the workout outfit I would wear later in the day, no sense in dirtying more clothes than necessary. And then shimmied into track pants over my red running shorts. Adding a zip up jacket over my nylon tank top, I pulled my golden hair into a loose bun on the nape of my neck without brushing it. 
	Deciding makeup was not necessary this morning, I left my room for the bathroom and a quick wash of the face. Staring at myself in the round mirror, I wondered if I looked any different now that the Protectorship was technically mine. My skin tone was the same flawless bronze that Seth’s was, a byproduct of our natural inner light; even without literally glowing, we still kind of glowed so to speak. The girls at school envied me for my great skin, and I thanked them leaving out the fact that it came with a Buffy the Vampire Slayer kind of destiny. My eyes were still frighteningly pale blue, like the color of really frozen ice, not just the cubes, more like polar ice caps. My eyes were my least favorite feature; they were too pale… too other-worldly. I was convinced I looked like a tanned ghost or the big bad wolf. 
The better to see you with my dear…. 
	Splashing more cold water on my face I wondered if other Stars worried about the shade of their eyes or were embarrassed of their skin tone. Or maybe, born and raised in the lowest level of Heaven and then sent to light up the galaxy and protect the universe, they had never even seen their reflection in a mirror.
	Huh. 
	Either way they were probably not caught up in vanity or lacking in confidence. And with that thought I left the bathroom in search of the traditional Sunday breakfast Annabelle always made for me. Other than saving humanity, eating chocolate chip pancakes had to be my second favorite event ever.
	I bounded down the servant stairs and into the kitchen expecting to greet Annabelle’s happy face and a plate full of steaming hot chocolate chip pancakes, like every other Sunday morning of my life when my parents were out of town. The chocolate chip pancakes were there, but Annabelle’s face wasn’t so much happy as it was terrifying and angry. 
	The whole atmosphere of the kitchen felt ripe with an awkward confrontation on the verge of a cataclysmic explosion and I immediately tensed. I hoped Annabelle wasn’t mad at me, although I worried now that maybe Annabelle didn’t remember me coming to her room last. She would have been very surprised to find a house full of men when she woke up this morning. 
	“Good morning,” I greeted her sweetly. She was at the stove with her back to the rest of the room, rigid as a pole. Jupiter sat at the kitchen table drinking a cup of coffee and reading the Sunday morning newspaper. When she didn’t answer, I tried to encourage more conversation. “Annabelle do you remember that I came to your room last night?” She didn’t respond, or even shrug her shoulder in acknowledgement so I pushed forward, “I don’t know if you had a chance to meet Jupiter this morning, but he is a friend-“
	“Oh, we’ve met,” Annabelle cut me off with more attitude than I’d ever heard from her. She was usually direct and alarmingly to the point, a personality trait that had taken half my childhood to get used to. But we had such a strong relationship now, that I couldn’t imagine what set her off. 
	Jupiter grunted then, a disgruntled snort of disapproval and it dawned on me exactly what the problem was. Annabelle half turned around to say something, but then seemed to think better of it. Shaking her spatula in the air irritably, she focused her attention back on flipping pancakes. 
	“Stella, how many pancakes would you like?” Annabelle asked, her frustration masked with a forcefully sweet tone.
	“Um, four. No, wait, five,” Annabelle loaded up my plate with her perfectly fluffy, deliciously chocolaty pancakes and I couldn’t help myself but call out again, “Wait! Six. I want six pancakes and no more!” I finished dramatically, waving my hand in the air as if Annabelle was the one forcing me to eat so many. 
	Annabelle delivered the hefty plate to the table, along with a bottle of warmed up maple syrup. I eyed my breakfast with a ravenous hunger, my eyes gleaming with gluttony. This time when Annabelle smiled down at me, her expression was real, shaped with true affection and amusement. 
	“Don’t worry,” I explained to no one in particular, in between delicious mouthfuls of carbs. “Tristan and I are running later, so I’ll work this all off.” 
	“Who’s Tristan?” Jupiter asked, already positive he wouldn’t like the answer. 
	“He’s my best friend,” I answered quickly, squirting more hot syrup in between the thick layers of pancakes. “And Annabelle’s grandson,” I added. 
	“A human,” Jupiter grumbled, disdain marking his tone. 
	“What else would he be?” Annabelle retorted from the stove. 
	“A pet,” Jupiter mumbled soft enough that only I, with my intensified hearing could make out his nasty comment. 
	“Jupiter,” I gasped, still not sure what to make of my weapons trainer. He tossed me a look that cautioned not to bother him again and I decided to heed his warning. 
	This time.
	“Stella, were you planning on going to church this morning?” Annabelle asked, turning off the griddle and emptying the spatula of the last perfectly made pancake onto a plate with identical others. 
	“Oh, I meant to tell you, I kind of…. my Jeep is kind of out of commission right now, so I was going to suggest someone else pick you up for church today,” I tried to skirt around the truth, hoping Annabelle just didn’t ask too many questions. It would be hard enough explaining how I accomplished that much damage to my vehicle and then walked away, let alone how the car got righted again and why on Earth I went ahead and picked up my supposed family friends after all that I would have allegedly gone through.
	“Oh, that’s all right, I’ll just have Trenton come after me then,” Annabelle moved the griddle to the sink and immediately started on the dishes. “And if he’s coming after me anyway, I might as well head on home after service. Your parents will be back tonight and with your guests, I really don’t think you’ll need me around today.” A muscle in Annabelle’s jaw twitched, tightening the wrinkled skin around her mouth. I noticed the subtlety and decided not to argue. I hated it when Annabelle left, she felt so much like part of the family, but I also knew Annabelle was a polite woman, proper and gracious and everything she thought a woman should be. Her behavior was super out of the ordinary for her and it was probably driving her crazy. I bit my bottom lip to keep from smiling at this same well-mannered woman just barely holding back her restraint from letting Jupiter have what could be decades of pent up sassiness. 
	“Ok, if you have to go, then you have to go,” I sighed, standing up to kiss Annabelle on the cheek. “I’ll finish these, if you want to go get ready.” 
	“Will you call Trent for me too?” Annabelle looked thrilled at the chance just to leave the kitchen; I could hardly imagine what transpired between her and Jupiter. I wasn’t sure I wanted to know either.
	“Sure,” I smiled and pulled the cellphone from my running pants. I pounded out a quick text to Tristan, explaining his grandmother’s wishes and then waited for a reply, tapping my fingernails on the counter in a measured rhythm. 
	“Is that another human friend of yours?” Jupiter asked dryly.
	“Trent is Tristan’s older brother. He goes to college in Lincoln, but he’s home for winter break,” I explained.
	“You didn’t answer my question,” Jupiter noted.
	I laughed lightly, realizing I hadn’t. I was just used to people understanding everything between Tristan’s family and mine…. between Tristan and me. “Yes, he is my friend.”
	“Hmph,” Jupiter grunted again and then turned back to his paper. 
	“What is that smell?” a groggy baritone voice asked from the doorway to downstairs. 
	Seth leaned against the doorframe, shirtless and disheveled. His black sweatpants sat low on his hips, revealing a thin line of plaid boxers and perfectly chiseled hip bones. His dark hair was a mess of waves that laid across his head in wild tangles, curling into charming semi-circles just at their tips. He crossed his arms and lifted his nose into the air, breathing in the aroma of baked chocolate chips left in the kitchen. 
	His eyes found mine because I was staring at him with a mixture of embarrassment and wide-eyed wonder from the sink. I had seen plenty of boys shirtless before, plenty of good looking, athletic boys. I grew up with Tristan and his brothers who had all been practically shirtless from the day we met, and all of the Shield brothers were hot without exception…. But nothing I had ever seen compared to the Angel standing in front of me. 
	The Actual Angel. 
	I reminded myself that Warriors were born that way. They lived hard, grueling lives and any lesser physique wouldn’t stand a chance against the Darkness. Still, I had to clamp my mouth closed when he lifted one palm to rub at the overnight stubble that darkened his jawline with the palm of his hand. His smile deepened and his honey colored eyes brightened, turning his expression mischievous. 
	I turned back to the dishes, convinced he could read my thoughts. My impure, totally uncalled for, wicked thoughts. And as I scrubbed the griddle clean, I wondered how treacherous it was to have lustful thoughts about my Counterpart before we were even…. uh…. more than whatever we were? I was probably the first Star in the history of the entire universe. Lust being one of the seven deadly sins and all…. I ignored him, or pretended to, as he brushed past me into my square country kitchen. 
I was so not going to be responsible for the fall of mankind because I couldn't keep my adolescent hormones under control, aka keep from ogling the man candy that invaded my house and my life.
	“Are these for me?” Seth asked, reaching for the plate of pancakes. 
	“Yeah, Annabelle made them for us,” I explained quietly, trying to hide the embarrassing squeak in my voice. 
	“Awesome,” Seth muttered and then sat down heavily at the table across from Jupiter. 
	When he used the syrup bottle for an extended amount of time, I couldn’t help but glance over at him. There he sat with the entire plate of left over pancakes, his fork digging in and breaking them apart savagely so he could shovel them in his mouth. There had to be at least fifteen pancakes, stacked gluttonously high on his plate. The maple syrup dripped down over the top of the pancake mountain in glops of sticky liquid and every time he took a bite he made this adorable little moaning sound that I desperately hated or loved, no definitely hated. 
	“Seth!” I gasped, stalking over to the rectangular oak table my dad had made by hand one summer in an effort to be more…. human. Although, I had not personally met another human that whittled their own furniture, I couldn’t fault dad for trying. Besides he was really proud of how much money he was convinced we saved. “I didn’t know you were going to eat all of them! Those pancakes are like gold around here! What am I supposed to eat for lunch now? And for dinner?” I demanded, forgetting all about the way his abdominal muscles folded over each other while he leaned over his plate, shoveling heaping forkfuls of my favorite meal into his greedy, perfectly formed mouth. 
	“Sorry,” he mumbled, with a mouth full of food. His skin was heated and subtly glowing, I could feel the warmth radiating from him and it was like a beacon calling me closer. Obviously I had to resist, mostly because of the pancakes. “You should be more specific next time.”
	I was normally a very easygoing girl, I rarely let things bother me and most of the time could laugh about any situation. Most of the time. Stolen pancakes and no lunch was not one of those times. 
“I think you should put at least half of those back! Do you really need….” I counted what was left of them in my head quickly, “seventeen pancakes just for breakfast?”
	Seth nodded enthusiastically, “Yes, I really do.” He reached for Jupiter’s coffee next, taking down what was left in the cup in one, quick swig. Jupiter didn’t even look up. Grumpy, ill-mannered, temperamental Jupiter didn’t care that Seth had stolen the last few drinks of coffee, because apparently that’s what Seth did. He saved humanity and stole people’s food. My hackles rose even more. The last drop of someone’s cold, bitter coffee was one thing. Annabelle’s coveted chocolate chip pancakes were an entirely different matter.
	 “Stella, he did fight a battle last night,” Jupiter reminded me in a voice that very much sounded like a reprimand.
	“A tiny battle!” I groaned. “Really, I’m not sure we can even call it a battle at all! It was more like a skirmish. Or a…. a…. warm up exercise! I don’t think his one act of bravery last night accounts for eating every single pancake left in this house,” I finished in a grumble. Jupiter and Seth both raised their eyebrows at me as if they could hardly believe my ungratefulness. I decided to push my luck just a little bit further, “Besides…. What if he gets fat? I mean, he is my Counterpart! I should be worried about stuff like that, right?” A blush crept up my neck and flowered across my cheeks. I knew I had gone too far, but what had fallen out of my mouth felt more like unstoppable word vomit than an actual, rational argument. 
	“You’re worried about me getting fat?” Seth moved from his seat with lightening quick speed. I hardly had time to comprehend he wasn’t sitting anymore before he stood directly in front of me, with both of his arms pressing against the counter on either side of me, pinning me in. “Let me assure you, my weight gain is nothing for you to be concerned about.” Seth’s amber colored eyes glowed with focused intensity and the way his dark hair fell across his forehead made me wonder if he was more Fallen than Angel. He reached for my hand, with a dangerously strong one of his own and pressed my palm against his flat, muscular stomach. His skin was hot to touch, and perfectly hard muscle. I shivered with the contact. “These are genetic; I wouldn’t worry about a few pancakes distorting your eye candy.”
	The flush that burned itself into my face, now deepened across my collar bone. I didn’t dare move my hand until Seth took his off mine, and then I retracted my fingers with the speed of my own angelic heritage, causing a smug smirk to break out across Seth’s face. 
	“I get your point,” I mumbled, not willing to back down from this fight. “But I still don’t appreciate the way you came in here and just snatched up all of the pancakes.”
	“Point taken,” Seth didn’t immediately move from the bicep-cage he built around me. He enjoyed watching me squirm. And I did squirm, with shaky breaths and an unfamiliar heat low in my belly and all. But then his eyes turned soft and he held my gaze, igniting the connection that tied us together, the one that I couldn’t even fully understand yet. I was impossibly tiny standing next to him. I wasn’t short, I was even tall compared to a lot of the human girls I went to school with, but next to Seth I felt hopelessly fragile and delicate. I instinctively knew that without him by my side I didn’t stand a chance against even a small army of Shadows, let alone the entire forces of Darkness mobilized against me and this planet. 
	“Seth,” Jupiter chastised from across the room. The tone of his voice reminded Seth that he was a Counterpart- a Warrior. He was supposed to protect and serve not intimidate and bully.
	Seth gave me a good natured, casual smile and then stood up straight. He held my gaze for a few moments longer, letting me feel his dominance like it was this physical thing between us. I shivered. 
	“I’m going to see if Annabelle needs any help,” I choked out, in a tightly strained voice. I broke the hold of Seth’s gaze first, hating that we already fought, that I already made things awkward for my Warrior. I groaned, frustrated with myself and flew up the servant stairs before anyone could object, or remind me what a terrible hostess I was playing. Or even worse, what a terrible Star I was being.
	“Please tell me that won’t be a problem with her training,” I heard Jupiter ask once I was around the corner. He almost sounded amused and so I paused on the stairwell, recognizing that Jupiter rarely felt amused. 
	“That won’t be a problem with her training,” Seth spouted back word for word. The huge smile probably lighting up his face completely evident in his voice. I was sure Jupiter was convinced that whatever he was talking about would definitely be a problem with my training. A nervous chill skittered down my spine just thinking about hand to hand combat training with Seth.

----

	After spending the majority of my day locked in my room, pretending that getting mad about pancakes was completely normal, I decided it was time to face the music…. or face Seth, in this case. And I decided I should probably acknowledge that he actually did fight a battle last night. Jupiter and he had been gone most of the day getting whatever of their possessions they could fly back with and packing the rest of it to have shipped here, but I could hear them down in the kitchen now and knew I needed to confront them.
	I texted Tristan on the way down the stairs, explaining that I would be a few minutes late for our run, something he was used to and probably expecting. I hoped my Jeep would make it into town, knowing I couldn’t risk having Tristan come to my house and meet Jupiter. He texted more questions, but I ignored them. Just like I ignored the feeling in my gut warning me not to do what I was about to.
	Seth sat at the kitchen table with Jupiter, going over something out of an extremely old looking, leather bound book. They peered over it with a kind of quiet reverence, and I could see a haze of dust floating around the cracked pages. Or were the pages glowing? 
	Seth looked up at me when I entered the kitchen and grinned. His smile was easy going and happy, but the look in his eyes seemed to be always calculating, always waiting for something to happen. He was a trained Warrior, a lesser Angel; I couldn’t expect anything else from him.
	“Hey, what are you guys doing?” I peered over the table and recognized the pages of the book written in the old language. I couldn’t read it yet, but Seth seemed to have no trouble. “What is that?”
	Jupiter barely spared me a glance, staring intently at the pages in front of him. His finger moved under the symbols and foreign language with seemingly exact comprehension. I wondered how Jupiter had come to learn the old language, he wasn’t a Warrior, not even a lesser Angel, and I highly doubted my kind went around to other planets teaching the sacred dialect to every species. 
	“It is the Alpha Hieros,” Jupiter answered blandly.
	“The Sacred Beginning….” I whispered, realizing I stood in a room with one of the oldest, most sacred documents in the history of the universe. I stilled, hovering over the table and came to the realization that the pages actually were glowing. They shined with a golden hue, as if they themselves were made of light. “You can both read it?” I whispered, afraid my very breath would distort the pages. 
	“Seth has been…. taught to read in this language, so that after I am gone, he may interpret the text,” Jupiter explained. 
	“And you?” I pressed, knowing without a shadow of a doubt that this book, the history of my people, the account of the war waged between light and dark was shared only between Stars and Angels. Jupiter, no matter what his charge, shouldn’t be in possession of this book. And if it was given to him, for whatever divine purpose, then that was highly out of the ordinary.
	“I was given….” Jupiter paused, looking up at me with eyes that flashed the deepest burgundy, like the color of old wine, before settling back into a muddled burnt maroon, “I was gifted with the ability to read your language, so that it would not become forgotten on this planet.”
	I thought for a moment about his response, and decided that he must be telling the truth because there was no other way to learn the language other than miraculous intervention. At one time, the Earth’s language mimicked that of the Angel’s that walked amongst humanity, as did every other planet created. But over time, and with the destruction of all other life throughout the entirety of space, save for Earth, the language had been forgotten by mankind, removed for the protection of its consecrated words.
	The different races of Earth now held their own dialects and the written text passed down from God Himself, retreated to the heavens. Except for this book. This book was all that remained in the possession of the army that fought against the Darkness.
	I stared for a moment longer as the two men leaned over the text, but when Seth’s eyes drifted back to me, I decided I needed to be polite. He was part of my world now, and it felt wrong to leave him at home while I went off to workout with another guy.
	I shook my head at that thought. There wasn’t anything between Seth and me yet, so I shouldn’t have guilty feelings about being alone with Tristan.
	“Seth, I’m going running with one of my good friends, do you want to come?” I asked casually, leaving out the fact that my good friend was actually my best friend and he was a boy. I had no reason to, and the logical part of my brain told me Seth wouldn’t care either way, not to mention he would find out soon enough anyway. Still, a warning flared in my gut telling me this was a bad idea. “I know you are probably sore or whatever from last night, but I thought you might like to get out of the house and stretch your legs.”
	“Are you running outside?” Seth asked, leaning forward in his chair. At least he had thrown a t-shirt on. But still, his biceps stretch tight as he put his weight on them and I worked to swallow, kind of hating this intense attraction I felt for him. I didn’t even know him.
	“No, we, uh…. we go run at the high school. There is a track above the basketball court,” I explained, smiling casually. I felt another surge of guilt, knowing I was leaving out the part where we had to break into the gym first. I hoped Seth wouldn’t have too much of a moral dilemma with the whole breaking and entering thing. I was positive it went against his angelic nature, but I reasoned that there was much worse trouble we could get into.
	Besides, I was technically just as angelic and it didn’t bother me.
	“That does sound nice,” Seth thought it over for a second. “You won’t mind if I tag along?” 
	“No, not at all!” I assured him. “It will give you a chance to meet someone else that goes to school with us.”
	“And your friend can keep up with us?” Seth looked doubtful. We were supernatural beings after all, and as his eyes dropped to my long, athletic legs, I blushed thinking about our stupid supernatural future together.
	“Well, yes, as long as I don’t turn all Star or anything.”
	“Ok, when are we leaving?” Seth asked, standing from the table and walking backward to the basement door.
	“Ten minutes, does that give you enough time?” I smiled at him again. He definitely had some Fallen in him. Maybe a distant cousin or great grandfather. His eyes danced devilishly and I was convinced no regular Warrior looked as dangerous or as devastating. Warriors were lesser Angels, paired with Stars to protect the universe. They weren’t the beings that served God directly, or carried out His immediate will; Warriors were the army that protected those Angels, and the last remaining planet housing life in the universe. They were the army of Heaven, waging war against the forces of evil. But despite the fact that they were trained killing machines, they were usually all goodness and light, like my dad. But Seth was more than that. Or less? No, definitely…. more. I just couldn’t put my finger on why.
	Seth nodded and then disappeared down the basement steps. I walked into the mud room, digging around for my running shoes, before joining Jupiter at the table. 
	“It’s not a problem if we leave, is it?” I asked Jupiter, realizing maybe I should have asked for permission first. 
	“Why would it be?” Jupiter mumbled from his study of the Alpha Heiros. 
	“I just didn’t know if I’m supposed to ask for…. permission from you?” I mumbled, embarrassed by how awkward this conversation was becoming. “I guess I don’t get your role in my life, yet.”
	“I’m just a trainer,” Jupiter responded curtly. “Not a babysitter. Fly to the moon for all I care, just do not, I repeat, do not engage in anymore battles until you’ve at least been trained with a sword.”
	A little taken aback, I wasn’t sure if he was joking or serious, so I replied with a simple, “Will do.” 
	Seth joined me upstairs a few awkward, silent minutes later in just shorts and a t-shirt. The rough Nebraska winter held temperatures in the low teens today, but I knew without a doubt Seth would not even be chilly. He might have to glow a little bit to stay warm, but somehow I doubted he would care and Tristan already knew part of the truth about who I was anyway.
	What Tristan didn’t know, was that he was about to get a crash course in all the rest of it. 
	“Do you think my car can make it into town?” I asked on our way out the kitchen door.
	“That depends….” Seth studied the crumpled passenger’s side and cringed. “How far is town?” 
	“If I speed, like fifteen minutes….” I answered, and then wondered if speeding would help my Jeep or hurt it. 
	“I’m sure it’ll be fine,” Seth decided, sticking his bottom lip out to concentrate completely on the door that seemed welded shut after last night’s impact. “If not, we can always fly home, right?” He tugged securely on the door handle, which abruptly ripped off the metal frame it was attached to. “Oops….” He mumbled, while tossing the damaged debris over his shoulder and prying the now loose door open. He crawled into the front seat and then had to lift the door and pull equally hard to jam the thing back into place. Not entirely sure it would hold, he gripped the arm rest tightly and decided to just hold it in place with his Warrior strength.
	“Yeah, that looks about right,” I laughed, after climbing into the driver’s seat. I laughed even more when Seth started to glow with the effort to hold the heavy door against the car. “Can’t you just melt it together or something? We won’t be able to use it as an entrance or exit anymore, but I have a feeling this little darling is seeing its last days.” 
	Seth laughed at the way I mourned my car, easily picking up on my sarcasm. Thank God he had a sense of humor! 
I gave him a wry smile, and turned around to make sure there was nothing behind me before I started the car. Seth was still smiling at me, holding the door as casually as he could and I paused for a moment to realize how lucky I was to get Seth and his sense of humor. He seemed fun, and relatively normal, even if he ate ALL of my chocolate chip pancakes. But I had seen Warriors before so duty-driven and task-minded that the devotion of their own Star didn’t seem to have any effect on them. I knew better with Seth. Maybe the Elders had been right in having us raised on Earth, maybe it relaxed us or gave us a bigger perspective. I just hoped we could stay this casual for a while. A very, very, very long while. 
	I coaxed the Jeep to start, literally, with encouraging words and a loving tap against the steering wheel until the engine sputtered to life, protesting it’s every move. Despite the obvious fragility of the car, I thrived on excitement and adrenaline, a side-effect of being born for battle. So I naturally drove like a race car driver across the frozen gravel roads that climbed and dipped over rolling hills, the car sliding and skidding with each turn or curve in the road wildly. It was a little difficult to see through the cracked and wayward windshield but that only increased the excitement for me. 
After a few minutes I slowed down just a little so that Seth could admire the scenery. Even in middle of a desolate winter, the Nebraska plains stretched out under a wide open sky with nothing standing between this gravel road and the horizon. Snow covered corn fields, and patches of dense pine trees blurred in the peripheral as I raced the Jeep through the postcard countryside. 
	I knew these roads intimately, having grown up on them. My dad had been letting me drive since I was big enough to reach the pedals and see over the steering wheel, and on Tristan’s farm I had grown up driving his dad’s tractors or racing Tristan and his brothers on four-wheelers. This land was my home. I gunned the engine, whispering sweet encouragement to the groaning Jeep until just seconds before I needed to turn, then I would expertly pump the brakes until I rounded the country roads with the skill of a NASCAR driver, staying just out of danger, but flirting with the slippery edge none the less.
	Why I couldn’t do that in the middle of the night with a deer standing in the road was beyond me. But everything felt clearer in the light of day. The bright sunshine almost blinding against the crisp purity of the snow pumped energy into my blood, enlivening me, breathing something supernatural into me. And I loved it.   
  	After fifteen minutes exactly, we came to the edge of town, which was simply a bank. I turned right, drove two blocks and turned into the high school. Seth looked around at all the empty space, even beyond the vacant parking lot and I watched as he realized this wasn’t the outskirts of town, this was the town.
	Welcome to Mead, Nebraska; population 571.
	Tristan’s old truck sat idling near the brick school building and when I shut off my Jeep, so did Tristan. I gave Seth a quick glance and reassuring smile, before jumping from my car and racing across the parking lot. I didn’t stop to make sure Seth followed me, although I hoped he did, but my eyes were glued on one thing and one thing only. 
	Tristan Shields stepped out of his white ’98 Chevy Silverado and ran a hand over his closely shaved head. His full lips twisted upward on one side and then his arms opened for his most favorite thing in life: me. 
	I crashed into him with my lightning speed and threw my arms around his neck. I wasn’t sure when we started this tradition, but for as long as I could remember I always ran to Tristan’s arms, even if I just saw him twelve hours ago, even if there was someone else watching. I always ran to him. I always threw my arms around his neck. And I always buried my face against his chest. He was safe to me- Tristan was home. 
	Tristan reciprocated the hug, holding me close to his body, just like he always did. I was warm, hot even, despite the bitter cold of the day. He dipped his head, so that his face rested in the curve of my neck and I shivered from the tickling breath that danced across my skin. 
	“Who’s your friend?” Tristan mumbled, lifting his eyes to meet the Angel Warrior standing behind me.
	I cleared my throat, saying a quick prayer that the two most significant boys in my life would become best friends too and turned around to Seth. “Tristan, this is Seth. He’s…. he’s my Counterpart.”

Chapter Four

	“Nice to meet you, Seth,” Tristan stepped around me, releasing me immediately from his hold and stuck out his hand for the Seth to shake. “You’re Counterpart?” Tristan looked down at me, his brow furrowing, recognition lighting his intelligent green eyes. He reluctantly turned his attention back to Seth and asked, “So you’ll be…. uh…. taking care of my girl, is that right?” 
I cringed noticing the little possession Tristan let slip into his phrasing. I had explained the whole supernatural relationship thing to him before, but I had also explained how we weren’t supposed to meet for years yet. Maybe I should have warned him that I was bringing Seth….
	“Your girl, huh?” Seth shot me a sideways glance before shaking Tristan’s hand. The two boys did their best version of a passive-aggressive manly handshake before taking a step back to size one another up. 
	I twirled the end of a piece of loose hair tightly around my fingertip nervously. I cut off the blood flow and the tip of my pointer bulged red before I realized it and let the hair go. This wasn’t going quite how I had imagined it should. For some reason I wasn’t picking up the vibe that they would be immediate and life-long best friends. 
	“So, are you two a…. thing?” Seth asked bluntly, his eyes narrowing infinitesimally. I bristled a little at the question, right now the only right he had with me was to protect me from everything evil; a human boyfriend, whether acceptable to the Elders or not, was technically none of his business. Still, it wasn’t like Tristan was just any regular person…. I mean, with every muscle on his body cut to perfection, his tall, lanky frame and his breath-taking smile, I knew he could be just as intimidating as Seth and his angelically Warrior self. Although Seth was an actual Angel…. no reason to have a superiority complex. 
	“If by thing, you mean best friends, then yes, we are. Tristan is more like my brother than anything else,” I explained lightly, grabbing onto Tristan’s bicep and shaking it playfully. I looked up at Tristan, craning my neck so I could see him clearly expecting a reassuring smile, the same smile I got every time I explained we were not a couple, but this time the only expression I got in return was a clenched jaw and narrowed eyes. 
	“So why are you here?” Tristan asked rudely. “I thought you weren’t supposed to meet until you both turned twenty-five or something?” 
	“Oh, that’s what I have to talk to you about!” I rushed forward into the conversation, hoping the severity of my situation would distract both boys from whatever weirdness was happening between them. “But you have to be freezing! Let’s go inside, and I’ll explain everything.” 
	When neither boy made an attempt to move, I decided they would follow me if I took the initiative. I led the way around the building to the back of the school where the locker rooms led out onto the football field. Finding the window that led downward into the boys’ locker room, I jimmied the lock, like I had done for years now, and removed the rectangle glass from its frame. I leaned it against the building and then turned to smile at Seth and Tristan who had followed me, like I predicted. Although by the scowls on their faces I assumed they followed a bit reluctantly. 
	“I’ll go first and help you down,” Tristan volunteered. “And you too, Seth, if you need it,” he finished with a challenge.
	“I doubt either Stella or I will need your help,” Seth countered, full of smug confidence. 
	Tristan faltered a little, realizing after all these years that I probably didn’t need his help. I could fly- actually fly. Probably jumping a few feet to a cement floor wasn’t a trial for me. But he never seemed concerned about that before and I didn’t mind if he wanted to be chivalrous. 
	“You’ve never needed my help, have you?” Tristan confronted me in a gentle voice; searching for the truth he knew I was incapable of hiding from him. My eyes glistened against the sun as I looked up at him and I blinked rapidly hoping to keep my Star instincts at bay. Glowing eyes could be unsettling, even to Tristan who had seen them glow thousands of times before. At his direct question, emotion flared beneath my skin, causing it to warm ever so slightly, glowing right along with the rest of me despite my effort to stay completely normal. 
	“No, I’ve never needed it,” I admitted, reaching out for Tristan’s fingers with my own. “But I’ve always appreciated it.” I gave him my most adoring smile, hoping to distract his sour mood. I loved Tristan like a brother and I hated that he felt disappointed. He was used to human girls, raised to be gentlemanly. And I hadn’t lied to him, even if I had an arsenal of super-human abilities, it was still nice to be treated like a lady.
	Tristan held my gaze for a moment longer before exhaling a sigh that told me I was forgiven. He slid in through the half window and then waited for me to join him. When I was halfway through the window, he reached up and held me by the waist so that he could slowly lower me to the floor. The gesture was familiar and practiced and even if he realized I didn’t need his help, it was still comforting that he wanted to give it to me. 
	I beamed at him when my feet touched the floor, turning to face him again and plant a kiss on his cheek. “I’m sorry this is weird,” I whispered quickly, before Seth joined us. “I was so excited for you guys to meet, I didn’t think that it might be…. awkward for you both.” 
	“Stel, it’s fine. I promise,” Tristan smiled back at me, and his eyes told me he was sincere. Whew. “Now tell me what happened, and why he’s here to begin with.” 
	“Ok, so last night, on my way home, I was kind of…. attacked,” I explained as Seth made the jump from window ledge to concrete floor. The boys’ locker room of Mead High School sat below ground and smelled like dirty feet. The old lockers, two half-lockers stacked on top of each other, made tunnels in the dim light leading through a maze of discarded jockstraps and assorted athletic cleats. An even dingier community shower took up one side of the room, encased by a tile wall, with two entrances. A bathroom connected to the showers through a swinging door, but I had yet to find the courage to explore the inside of those stalls. 
	“Attacked?” Tristan stepped forward, instinctively wrapping his arms around me. “Why didn’t you call me?” 
	“I thought about it…. but there was nothing you could do, really….” I cringed, knowing he would hate the truth to the answer. I quickly continued to explain, hoping he would forget that he wasn’t a part of my war, well not in the army sense of things. “Anyway, there were hundreds of Shadows and they came out of nowhere. They destroyed my car and then…. Actually, I don’t know what they planned to do with me, because it would have taken a lot more of them to kill me than that,” I rambled, a character trait Tristan was accustomed to. He waited patiently for me to gather my thoughts and finish. “Anyway, I scared them away with my whole Star-power thing and then Seth and Jupiter, my weapons trainer, showed up and kind of saved the day. They did the actual killing of Shadows, while all I really did was scatter them.”
	I noticed Seth try to hide his smirk when I talked about him saving the day, but it was obvious he was proud of his battlefield accomplishment last night. I glanced over at him and winked, which was something I had actually never done to a boy before and smiled. He should be proud. 
“But you did do an excellent job of scattering them,” he praised me indulgently. 
	“Why did they attack you in the first place? I thought no one knew who you were or that you were here? Do they usually attack people like that? Or, uh… Stars like that?” Tristan asked seriously. Tristan had known the truth about me since we were ten years old. I came right out and told him everything about my origins, my destiny on this planet and my future role in saving Earth from the legions of Darkness one day when we were climbing hay bales on his family’s farm. It had been hard for him to listen to as a ten year old boy, tasked with keeping the secrets of my life confidential. But he had believed immediately, had never doubted that what I was telling him was complete truth. Not just because the topic was raised when he asked me why I glowed every time he teased me and not because he had seen the proof I wasn’t human but because our friendship was everything to him, and to me. Even at ten he knew I couldn’t and wouldn’t lie to him. 
	“No, they don’t.” I replied sullenly, “They knew who I was. We’re not sure how they figured it out, or if someone betrayed us, but they knew. We are hoping my parents will know more when they get back tonight.”
	“So how did you know she was in trouble?” Tristan turned to Seth. I could see the mixture of gratitude for saving me warring with possessive uncertainty. He pulled me back against his body, wrapping his arms around my shoulders. It was a dominating gesture that kind of reminded me of a dog marking his territory. Not that I was his territory, just more like the general area of our small town. I was only a symbol.  
	Seth looked at me warily. I knew my honesty with Tristan was unsettling to him. I was really upfront in general, but especially to Tristan. I knew Seth would never be able to trust Tristan the way I did. Tristan was just a human, and Seth owed him no explanations, but I hoped Seth at least trusted me. 
	“It’s Ok, Seth. I tell Tristan everything,” I reassured him, recognizing his doubts. “And he’s the only human that knows, he’s been sworn to complete secrecy and he won’t tell anyone,” I promised and then exchanged a look with Tristan. 
	Our shared glance only caused Seth to look less inclined to share information with him. But he did eventually explain, “Jupiter and I received a distress call from Sidra and Nisroc, requesting immediate aid. By the time we got to them, though, they were already dead,” Seeing the confused look on Tristan’s face, Seth clarified, “Sidra was the Protector of Earth up until yesterday and Nisroc was her Counterpart. When we found them murdered, we knew our leadership had been breached and so we came straight here to find Stella and make sure she was Ok. We found her easily enough; the sky surrounding her was completely filled with Shadows. “
	“But you had already banished them or whatever? They just weren’t dead yet?” Tristan asked me, wanting to restore some of my credit. 
	“Yes, I scattered them, but I had no idea what I was doing! Seth is really the hero, and he is so much more prepared than me. My training really has been lacking, I’m sure the Elders cannot be happy with me or with my parents,” I lamented, worrying for the first time about the consequences my parents would have to face.
	“Stella, if the Elders were unhappy with your training, they would have sent someone a long time ago,” Seth reasoned. I looked up at him, thankful for his reassuring words and decided he was right. The Elders watched everything, or at least it seemed as if they could see everything. They were such a temperamental, stringent group, and if they were worried about my training, they would have stepped in a long time ago and either replaced my biological parents with dutiful, drill sergeant ones or replaced me with a Star that cared more about brandishing a sword made from Heaven’s Fire than my unnamed prom date.
	Not that I was really all that worried about a prom date. It was still months away, I had plenty of time. 
	“So what now?” Tristan asked, removing his arm from around me to clasp my hand instead. Our fingers intertwined, my palm flat against his and the touch felt so reassuring, so familiar that I had to stifle a sigh. 
	“Now, we wait for my parents to get back and hear from the Elders. I don’t have any formal training, so Jupiter is here now to train me and continue training with Seth,” I sighed, feeling as if the perfect world I had always known was crumbling to pieces around me. 
	“So Seth is staying?” Tristan asked. I ignored the way his voice grew gruff and desolate over the question and chose to hope that once they got to know each other they really would have a strong friendship. 
	“Yes! You don’t really expect me to fight the Darkness all by myself, do you?” I teased. 
	“Obviously not, I was just hoping you still had a little more time before you became all Stella Day, warrior princess on me,” Tristan joked. “Like until after soccer season or prom or something….”
	See? Tristan was already thinking about prom too.  
	“I think I get to finish high school,” I countered, giving myself and Tristan some hope. “At least nobody has said otherwise so far.”
	“So you still have to go to high school and fight evil. You’re life kind of sucks,” Tristan looked down at me with his usual happy energy returning. 
His mood instantly perked up as soon as he realized I would not be plucked from his life or my daily activities. And I couldn’t blame him; if he was suddenly ripped out of my life I would be devastated. We meant the world to each other. He was smiling again when he realized instead of leaving him, I would just be adding weapons training; weapons training as in the kind that actually involved fighting with swords and daggers and fire. And I would not be giving up basketball practice, student council and/or homework. 
	“And be in shape for basketball practice on Thursday,” I whined, agreeing with Tristan’s point of view.
	“Do you want me to call the Shadows and ask them to come back? I could tell them to bring more with them this time. Maybe you want something a little more challenging?” Tristan laughed and I joined in, thankful for the mood change from ominous to denial.
	“I don’t think you should do that just to get out of basketball practice,” Seth said dryly to both of us, his golden brown skin brighter than usual.
	“It’s just a joke, Seth,” I patted him on the bicep and flashed him another charming smile. “Now come on, I want to see what you’re made of! I need to know if you can keep up with me!” 
	They followed me up the stairs and into the gym already buzzing with aggressive energy. This was not going to be a friendly competition. But I decided to let them work out their competitive edges where boys should be competitive, in the gym and on the track. They probably couldn’t really hurt each other while I was around, right? 

----

I didn’t, and couldn’t understand boys. I watched Tristan and Seth race around the track while I finished my cool down stretches, and decided they had to be the most ridiculous species God ever created, both human and Angel. Seth did his best to run with only human strength, but Tristan was fast, too fast for Seth to stay completely honest, human and win.  
In the end, Seth crossed the finish line with a cocky grin across his face and a faint glow to his skin. I shook my head, deciding to save my congratulations for when they did something worth congratulating. 
Tristan sauntered over to me, narrowing his eyes, clearly suspicious of his opponent’s speed. “Did he really win fair and square?” 
“Of course I did! Do you really think I needed to cheat to beat a human?” Seth grunted from a little ways away, although he didn’t quite meet Tristan’s cold glare while defending himself. 
“Stella, tell me the truth,” Tristan demanded, resting his hands on his hips while his chest still heaved heavily from his run. 
“Hey, leave me out of this,” I took a step back, truly uninterested in being thrown into the middle of whatever issue lay between them. “I’m just an innocent bystander.” I flashed Tristan an innocent wide-eyed look and hoped he would move on.
“You’re anything but innocent,” Tristan murmured, taking a step closer to me. 
I backed away, recognizing the glint in Tristan’s eyes and not understanding where it came from. My back bumped against the white brick wall of the gym, while he trapped me with one arm over my head. I stifled a groan, knowing this was Tristan’s way of letting Seth know that he might have won the race, but he wasn’t about to win whatever contest involved me. 
“Tristan, what are you doing?” I asked, a giggle bubbling up before I could stop myself. Tristan’s eyes swept over me, and he ran his free hand over his sweat-soaked shaved head. I knew I should be completely grossed out by him, I mean, he was a mess right now, sweaty and smelly and rippling muscles…. But something about the way the sweat ran down his neck and over the hollow part at the base of his throat caused my eyes to linger unexpectedly. 
“I just want to know if you have plans tonight?” he asked in his most innocent sounding voice. “We still have two free nights of winter-break left and I want to take full advantage of the whole no-homework thing.” His dark green eyes reminded me of the color of grass at night and they blazed with an intensity I had seen before, an intensity that remained between us even before Seth showed up. He dipped his head, and waited for my response. 
I could feel Seth’s eyes on us and couldn’t stop myself from repeating in a low, careful voice, “Tristan, what are you doing?” 
“What do you mean?” He picked his head back up and blinked his eyes like a confused puppy dog.
Which reminded me, “You are not a dog and I am not a tree. This is so not going to work,” I lifted my hands to his chest bare chest and pushed him back. His hands clasped down on mine and held them to him.
“I know that, Stella,” he all but growled. 
My eyes flicked to Seth who stood there bouncing on the balls of his feet, his jaw clenched tight and the glow under his skin burning like hot embers in a building fire. 
“You know that I love you, don’t you?” I turned my eyes back to Tristan and softened my tone. 
“No, I don’t know that,” Tristan complained, it was his usual response whenever I confessed my platonic love for him. 
Even if he didn’t want to hear the truth in my words, I knew I had gotten through to him, that it would only take a few seconds before reality set in. I had always been Tristan’s, ever since we were little. Other boys didn’t ask me out, or even flirt with me. And everyone in our small town accepted whatever was between us was marriage material, even though we both knew there was nothing more to it than friendship. There could never be anything more. And so, I waited for his expression to relax and his testosterone level to drop before I continued.
“I’ll text you later, but I don’t think I’ll be able to do anything tonight. My parents are getting back later and we have to have the whole, ‘what happens now’ talk,” I sighed, afraid of the future conversation and the consequences it would have on my life. 
“Oh that’s right,” Tristan laughed. “I almost forgot the future of mankind now rests on your shoulders.” He released my hands and pulled me into a completely friendly, but disgustingly sweaty hug. I laughed against his chest, thankful he could take everything in stride. “But you’ll text me later?”
“Yes,” I agreed. “Now get off of me, you’re so gross!” 
Tristan let go of me and we gathered our warm ups to slip on before crawling back through the locker room window and out into the late winter afternoon. Seth stayed silent until the two of us were alone again in the beat up Jeep that still needed to get them home. 
“I don’t think I like him,” Seth admitted as he watched Tristan’s big white pickup pull out of the parking lot.
“I don’t know where I went wrong,” I sighed. “I was sure you two would be best friends.”
Seth laughed too at that, a deep, throaty laugh that made me smile even wider. “It probably has something to do with that pretty blonde head of yours.” 
Knowing he was right, but not wanting to admit it, I threw my arm out to smack Seth in the chest. He reached up to block me, and nearly dropped the door that he still held firmly in place next to him, since it no longer stayed connected to the vehicle. We both started laughing and what blossomed between us was more than a new friendship, but a well-rooted trust that was solidly planted in the base of our souls. We were partners now; this world needed us both if it was to survive. And likewise, we needed each other if we hoped for the same fate.

Chapter Five

	My parents were already home and sitting at the kitchen table with Jupiter when Seth and I walked through the back door. The early sunset left the outside world dark by the time we drove home and I couldn’t help but feel chills of the Darkness nearby. I convinced myself that since Seth seemed unbothered, they were in my imagination and nothing more. I had been shaken up the night before, and it was messing with me, that was all. 
	Once inside the kitchen, I left all fears of impending doom behind me and ran for my parents, thankful they were once again home safe from one of their missions. My father stood up first, enveloping me in his strong, safe arms and holding me tightly to him. Micah Day, whose name meant Angel of the Divine Plan, was one of the fiercest Angelic Warriors alive. He stood towering over me at 6’5 and because of his muscular frame and chiseled, god-like face seemed invincible to not just humans, but many Angels alike. He was an intimidating man to meet, and an ironic contrast to many of the other farmers in the area who were aging and overweight from spending too much time sitting on combines and eating too many steak and potato dinners. He did his best to hide his stature by wearing thin-framed glasses and keeping his light brown hair slightly askew, but I knew the Clark Kent rouse only confused humans. 
	“I’m sorry we left you Stella-bean,” he apologized huskily in my ear. 
	I trembled just a little, trying to stop the sob that threatened to explode from me. I hadn’t taken the time to really think last night through, and hadn’t really wanted to. But hearing the fear in my father’s voice sent reality crashing around me, clattering to the floor of my stomach and vibrating through my bones. 
	“I’m Ok,” I promised, lifting my head bravely to meet my father’s pale blue eyes, the same ones I had.
	“I know,” he sighed with the resign of a father that knew this was only the beginning for his daughter.
	“My turn,” Celina Day announced, taking me from my father and into her own loving arms. 
	I was obviously Celina’s daughter. There was no question when we stood next to each other. Our golden blonde hair fell in the same curled-at-the-end waves, and our slightly upturned noses, and full mouths reflected each other like mirror images. Our only striking difference was the color of our eyes, where I had inherited my father’s ice-blue color, Celina’s glowed a deep gold that matched the color of her hair and skin; she masked the oddity of their color with contacts when on this planet, but having just returned from a mission they glowed with the light buried inside of her. She had been a Sun elsewhere in the universe, with a whole galaxy of planets in her charge, before duty called her to Earth and her husband, to raise her baby to inherit the responsibility of the Earth.
	Stars and Warriors were the lowest level of angelic beings. Our base was on the lowest level of Heaven, but our task to protect life kept us mostly away from home. Rarely did a Warrior and Star actually get to spend significant amount of time together, but instead chose to procreate in responsibility to their race. Boys were born Warriors, and girls were born Stars, although the titles merely differentiated jobs and genders, both sexes were capable of the same fetes of supernatural. 
	My own parents had been chosen for Earth because of their great skill in battle, and their relatively human-esque looks. It was important for a Star raised in the human world to look like a human, meaning her hair color needed to be one of the natural colors and textures of Earth and the same with eyes. Since I had blonde hair and blue eyes, I fit the qualifications perfectly; pair my looks with the genealogy of battle-success in my family and I was an obvious choice for Earth.
	Not that I wasn’t still a little freaked out by my future…. but at least the Elders had faith in me. 
	I knew Seth was chosen for the same reason, but his parents had been killed when he was still young, probably in battle. Celina and Micah still had responsibilities to their battalions, and although they were allowed to fight together, they could not stay on Earth for long periods of time without being called back to fight. That was something Seth and I would never experience, we would never be called from this planet, never fight amongst our fellow Stars, never feel the emptiness of space or the thrill of battle formations.
	But we did have hope. Hope that the forces of Heaven would stand against the evil of Hell and win; that our fellow Stars would light up the universe and keep the Darkness at bay and that the Fallen would not get the chance to turn this planet into a desolate feeding ground like every other planet that once inhabited the expanse of space. Only Earth remained. And only Seth and I had been charged to protect it on the frontlines of battle.  
	“What are you thinking about?” my mom interrupted my thoughts and pulled me back to the kitchen. 
	“What it will be like to be the Protector,” I mumbled truthfully. 
	“Sit down, we need to talk about that,” my dad directed, putting a strong hand on my shoulder. I sat down next to my mom, while my dad took his seat at the head of the table. Seth and Jupiter sat silently across from us, waiting patiently for the conversation to begin. “Seth, it’s good to meet you by the way,” my dad reached out a hand to Seth and the two Warriors met with hands clasped tightly against each other’s forearms. “I’m Micah, and this is my wife, Celina.”
	“Pleasure to meet you,” Seth replied respectfully. 
	“We were just talking about your futures,” my dad confessed, looking at Jupiter before continuing. “What happened with Nisroc and Sidra was unexpected. The Elders are…. concerned that there is a spy in their midst. Besides the Elders themselves and Jupiter, no other Warrior or Star knew the whereabouts of their hideout, not even the Stars closest to Earth.”
	“Callisto,” Jupiter spat and it sounded very much like a curse word. “Then it is what we suspected, a spy is the only reasonable explanation,” Jupiter growled. 
	“We cannot be for sure, but yes, it does look like that. It would explain how they found Stella too,” my dad finished gravely, glancing at me with deep concern.
	“So, what is the plan?” Seth asked, in a meek tone that belied the fierceness in his eyes. He lifted his gaze to meet mine and they were etched with concern. This wasn’t how things were supposed to happen, or how the Elders planned our purpose on Earth. 
	“To stay put,” Micah said firmly, which caused every eye to turn to him. “The Elders have decided that to move Stella now would be a sign of weakness. She has not received the fullness of her powers yet, but she is still a threat to the Darkness. If we move now, there is no guarantee they won’t follow us and we have built lives here; this is the fulfillment of the plan, we cannot give up on it now. Seth, you and Jupiter will move here too and we will finish your training together. You might have already guessed this part, but it’s more crucial than ever that you two stay together and learn to fight side by side and protect each other. Until Stella and Seth turn eighteen, the Elders have sent a replacement Star, Serena and her Warrior, Nathaniel. They will temporarily carry out your duties until you two finish high school and Stella receives the last of her abilities at eighteen.”
	“But what about-“I jumped in impatiently.
	“We’ll keep them safe,” my father comforted me, knowing I was asking about the people living near us. “The Darkness knows where you live now, but you will be protected. Serena and Nathaniel will always be near, and your mother and I have been relieved from our posts as of today. We aren’t going to leave you anymore.” My dad’s eyes darkened with determination and I knew better than to argue with him. 
	I worried about my friends, about the innocent people living in this area, but my father was right. They would be protected, possibly more so now than they ever were before.
	“And we will start training right away,” Jupiter offered, but I didn’t think he was trying to comfort me. “Of course, we will have to figure out living arrangements. Surely there is something around here for us to procure. Maybe even in town?” he continued, the word “town” coming out of his mouth dripping in heavy sarcasm. 
	“Absolutely,” my dad agreed, “although you will probably do better to find a place with property. You could use several acres of land to train on. In fact, I know of a place that is for rent not that far from here. I’ll call the owner now, and see if it’s still available.”
	My dad and Jupiter stood up from the table to follow the lead on possible housing. I looked at Seth who was deep in thought and wondered what life would be like now. 
	“Seth, have you ever been to public school before?” my mom asked, breaking the settled silence.	
	“Not properly,” Seth admitted, shrugging his shoulders. “Jupiter taught me at home.”
	“Well, you’ll do fine,” she reassured him. “Mead has a small high school and it’s easy to navigate. I’m sure you’ll have no trouble fitting in. Don’t you think, Stella?” 
	“Nope, no trouble at all,” I bit back a grin. I appraised Seth’s perfect features again and thought about the poor female population at Mead who would have to put up with an Angel among them on a daily basis. 
	“And Stella knows everybody, she can help you make friends,” my mom continued, a small smile playing at the corner of her lips as her thoughts went in the same direction as mine. 
	“That’s because everybody knows everybody,” I reminded my mother dryly. Small town life did not exactly grant anonymity and in a town with little more than five hundred people, it was hard to not get to know everybody. 
	“That’s true,” she sighed as she stood up from the table. “And that reminds me, I’m in charge of the bake sale for this Friday night’s games.”
	“We just got back from a mission,” my dad reminded her as he and Jupiter reentered the kitchen. “Why don’t you take tonight off from Booster Club duties? At least wash the blood off your hands before you attempt an apple pie,” he joked.  
	“I don’t have any blood on my hands,” my mom swatted at her husband, laughing along with him. “And you know they stopped letting me bake a long time ago! I just have to make sure everyone else is bringing something homemade.”
	“From fighting to organizing farm-wives, are you sure you’re ready for this kind of life, Seth?” My dad turned his twinkling blue eyes on my Counterpart, more worried about him dealing with human life than the forces of Darkness.
	“I’m not going to have to organize bake sales, am I?” Seth choked out, half panicked. 
	“Only if you want to,” I laughed. 
	“I won’t. I won’t want to,” Seth assured me, a slow smiling turning his lips upward as he realized my dad was joking. 
	 “Well, if you change your mind, just let us know,” I winked at him, the second wink in my life ever. What was wrong with me! Why did being around Seth make my eyes all twitchy? “Ok, I need a shower!” I announced, stretching my arms over my head. 
	“And we are going to go look at this property,” My dad declared, concluding that our meeting was over. “Do you want to come, Seth?”
	“Do I have time for a shower?” he asked.
	“A quick one,” Jupiter grunted, sounding very parental. “And Stella, you should know, training starts tomorrow morning. You need to be down here by 6:30 and we’ll make good use of your father’s fields.”
	“Sounds fun,” I replied, not really sure if I was excited or terrified. A part of me longed to learn how to wield weapons and answer the innate call inside of me to fight, but the other part of me, the part that was raised in a human world and was already wary of Jupiter’s gruff demeanor, wondered exactly what I was about to get myself into. 
	“It will be fun,” Seth encouraged me, noticing the apprehension work its way across my forehead. “Weapons are the best part of this whole thing.”
	“I’ll take your word for it,” I smiled down at him, feeling relieved that Seth would be there with me. 
	I walked upstairs putting aside my fears for tomorrow and sent a quick text to Tristan telling him he could come over after all. I had expected more information to be covered in our meeting, but I wondered if my parents and Jupiter kept it short because there wasn’t much more information than what we covered. 
	A spy had worked their way inside the Council of Elders before, but not in a very long time, several dead planets ago if I remembered right. It was hard to imagine now though, with all of the security precautions and the way the Elders kept tabs on their current army, how a spy could slip past their impenetrable wall of defenses. It would have had to be someone embedded deep inside their ranks for hundreds, maybe thousands of years. And they would have had to be very patient to wait all this time. 
	I wondered why now though? Why would they attack Sidra now? And if they killed her, why hadn’t they gone after me the same way? Even if they were unsure if I was the next Protector, a human life meant nothing to them, why hadn’t they just killed me to be safe?
	There were more questions than there were answers, and I had to trust the Elders to get to the bottom of this quickly, even working with a spy amongst them. I shuddered at the thought of not feeling safe anymore. Could I trust a compromised board of elderly Angels? I didn’t have much of a choice, but suddenly their lack of interest in how I was raised became a concern. Maybe it wasn’t so much that my parents were doing things right after all, but a concentrated effort by the spy among the Elders to keep me unprepared. 
	A few deep breaths later, I decided there was nothing I could do about my past training, but there was something I could do tomorrow and that was to get caught up as quickly as possible. I trusted Seth and Jupiter was growing on me, so all that was left was for me to throw myself into my training and trust the God-given genes and instincts I was born with. 
	Shutting my mind off from my Star duties for the night, I showered quickly, relishing in the heat of the water and then blow-dried my hair. I had just thrown baggy sweatpants and a red long-sleeved volleyball t-shirt- courtesy of Mead High- on when there was a tap on my window. I finished getting dressed by pulling on some long wool socks, some hard-soled slippers and some mittens before climbing out my bedroom window onto the flat roof. Tristan was already sitting down on top of a flannel blanket he brought from his house. I sat down next to him and leaned back on my elbows. 
	“Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight,” he teased softly, as we snuggled up next to each other for warmth. 
	“Stop it right now,” I warned, unable to keep the smile off my face.
	“What?” Tristan asked innocently. He was dressed almost identically to me in baggy gray sweatpants and a red, Mead hooded-sweatshirt. He had a black stocking cap pulled over his shaved head and thick gloves that he used when he went snowboarding on trips to Colorado.
	“At least it wasn’t Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,” I admitted, warming us both up with my inner heat that radiated softly from me, even when I wasn’t glowing. 
	“Everything’s going to change now isn’t it?” Tristan asked, the tone of his voice changing dramatically. He was rarely serious except on his respective sports fields and I couldn’t stop myself from looking up into his forest green eyes and wanting to falsely reassure him.
	But I couldn’t. I could never lie to him. 
	“Yes, everything is going to change,” I recalled my own thoughts only a few minutes ago and settled deeper next to him. “The Darkness has never launched an attack like that before, at least on Earth. We are suddenly playing with a different rulebook; I’m not sure what will happen next.”
	“I meant, between us,” Tristan murmured. I glanced over at him and the lines of his forehead had tightened. I knew it stressed him out when I talked about my future, he worried too much. But now he was stressing me out talking about our present.	
	“Why would things change between us?” I asked, pinpricks of anxiety lifting the hairs on the back of my neck.
	“Stella, we can’t stay best friends forever. You have bad guys to fight, and I have farms to…. farm,” he explained sarcastically at the way his life sounded stacked next to mine.
	“We can stay best friends forever,” I replied seriously. “Or are you unclear with what “BFF” means?” I nudged him with my shoulder and he laughed. “Obviously we need those necklaces.”
	“What necklaces?” 
	“You know those ones you give to your friends in elementary? Like it’s usually a heart broken in two and one side says “best” and the other side says ‘friend.’ And you give it to your best friend so that everyone knows where you stand.” I explained.
	“No, I have no idea what you’re talking about. I don’t think guys are ever supposed to give each other necklaces.” He shook his head at me, a little bewildered.
	“Well, you don’t just give them. You also give them back when you decide you don’t want to be best friends with that person anymore. It’s a very emotionally involved process,” I sighed, remembering how serious elementary life was once upon a time. I wondered if I would feel the same way about high school in a few years.
	“That sounds mean,” Tristan observed seriously.
	“Well, girls can sometimes be mean,” I admitted.
	“I would never give your necklace back,” Tristan assured me with mock-seriousness. “If you gave me a necklace, I would keep it forever.”
	“That’s because you’re not a girl,” I agreed.
	“True.” Tristan reached down and put my hand in his. “So nothing’s going to change?”
	“Nothing,” I promised. “We will always be best friends.”
	A pause hung in the air between us. There was both promise and prophecy in that statement and I took the moment to reflect. We sat huddled next to each other, I was trying to keep Tristan as warm as possible without lighting completely up. We sat staring at the wide open sky, like we had on so many other nights. I could name all the constellations, even though I referred to them as battle formations and I could name almost all the closest Stars by name. 
Tristan could sit by me for hours listening to everything I could tell him about the world beyond human comprehension. I wondered if he was the only human on Earth with this secret knowledge and then wondered if he was crazy for taking me seriously. But he would never doubt me; he cared about me way too much.
As a friend. 
The world stood gazing at the sky, naming age-old constellations and seeing only balls of gas and light spread across the expanse of the universe. I saw fellow fighters, protecting the last remaining vestige of life. Stars were spread across the universe in endless beacons of life, warding off the Darkness that crowded every remaining space. Where the light could not or did not touch there was Darkness. Humanity saw the physical properties of space, and I saw the metaphysical, a completely different, separate but the same, spiritual world. The blackness of space was not all emptiness, but an ancient evil that would annihilate Earth as willingly as it had all the other planets and claim victory over the solar systems.
As long as there was life, there would be Darkness. And as long as there was Darkness, the Light would protect that life with everything it possessed. The life on Earth would never be left to fight the Darkness alone.
“Ok, so tell me more about the Darkness,” Tristan broke into my thoughts. “Tell me what to expect.”
“What to expect?” I thought about his question, how to explain it to a human for a minute before responding. “It’s everywhere. Not just in the night, but everywhere. The Darkness is the evil that invades mankind and tries to consume the last of life from this universe,” I explained ominously and Tristan’s eyes grew a little wide with my regurgitated- from everything my parents taught me- response. “You understand the concept of evil, well that is the Darkness. They are synonymous. I don’t know a better way of explaining it to you.” 
“So that’s what you fought last night, like pure unadulterated evil?” Tristan asked and I nodded. “So those Shadow-things, that’s what the Darkness is?” he tried to understand. No…. he tried to comprehend. 
“Yeah, they’re part of the Darkness. When I say that, I mean it more as a concept I guess. So there are the Shadows, they are literally…. shadows. They can do small amounts of destruction and what not, but they aren’t super dangerous unless they arrive in flocks like they did last night. And then there are the Fallen. They are Angels, or were once Angels…. It’s like, Ok, you know the story of Lucifer, and how he was cast out of Heaven and a third of the Angels were sent with him, right?” 
“Like, from the Bible?” Tristan clarified.
“Yes, right, from the Bible,” I agreed, glad I didn’t’ have to go over that. Tristan went to church with Annabelle most of the time, but I didn’t know how well he listened. “Ok, so those Angels that make up his followers were the original Fallen. Lucifer is obviously the main bad guy, but over time he has added a lot more to his collection of bad guys.”
“You mean Angels still fall from heaven?” Tristan asked, deciding he couldn’t take any more of this seriously. He trusted me, but I knew this was weird. 
“Yes, absolutely. Like you, we have free will. Even if we’re born as an Angel, it doesn’t mean we can’t become part of the Fallen,” I said solemnly. I had heard too many stories of Angels being brought over to the dark side to know better. “My dad says that every species is called to both the light and the dark, to goodness and to evil, it’s how we live our lives that decide who our hearts choose to follow.” 
“Deep, Stel,” Tristan teased, nudging me with his shoulder. 
“My dad said it, not me,” I nudged him back. “Anyway, the Fallen are the Angels that choose to serve Lucifer. They look just like Angels, even can behave like us, but obviously they’re evil.”
“Creepy,” Tristan shivered exaggeratedly. “So not even you can tell the difference?”
No one on Earth would guess I wasn’t human unless they saw me glow. The thought that the same kind of species walked around Earth bent on destroying every last living thing completely undetectable to the human eye raised the hairs on my arms, and churned my stomach uneasily. 
“Well, I can tell that they’re not human. I have this like supernatural sense that lets me know when something is different. But if they were acting normal, or good, or whatever then you couldn’t necessarily tell that they were Fallen,” I explained, thinking again to the spy who had infiltrated the Elders. 
“Ok, what else?” Tristan shifted, laying back against his blanket and opening his arm for me to snuggle into. 
I cuddled closer to him and said, “Um…. so Lucifer is like the main bad guy, but he has a universe of evil to run, so there are other lesser Angels that do his bidding on planet.”
“So they really are trying to destroy Earth. This isn’t like a movie, this is real?” Tristan smiled cynically. 
“Earth is the last planet with life; the Darkness has taken all the others. If Earth falls, the Darkness wins.” I finished matter of fact. 
“You’re pretty important, Stel,” Tristan leaned in and pressed his lips against the top of my head. 
“Ugh, don’t remind me,” I sighed, leaning into him and relishing in his comfort. I laid my head down in the crook of his arm and took comfort in the rhythmic rising and falling of his chest. I used the bubble of warmth and security that was Tristan to try and repress the insecurities bubbling up inside of me. 
“If anyone can do it, it’s you,” Tristan squeezed me and pulled me closer to him. 
“Tristan, I’m sixteen. I haven’t even picked up a sword yet! How am I supposed to protect all these people from all of the forces of evil?” I tried to swallow them, but my fears fell from my mouth before I could stop them. I was supposed to be courageous and confident…. insecurity was only fuel for my enemies.
“A sword? Stella that is so hot. Like Princess Leia hot,” Tristan smirked, deflating the tension buzzing around my head and lessening those disabling fears for a few moments.
“Oh, my gosh, shut up!” I groaned, elbowing him in the ribs. 
Comfortable silence fell between us and the rest of our time was spent watching the Stars overhead. There was a lot to worry about, a lot to think about for both of us, but together it seemed like we could conquer it all.

Chapter Six

	“Morning, sunshine,” Seth called to me as I trudged my way through three feet of snow to meet him.
	I mumbled something incoherent in reply and pushed my boots through the thick snow to meet Seth and Jupiter in the middle of one of my father’s fields. I was warm enough with my inner light creating a haze of warmth around me, but I still clung to my thermos of hot chocolate as if it were an indispensable life-line.
	Jupiter stood in the middle of the field, hands poised in an intricate and very involved Tai Chi pose. His eyes were closed and his face relaxed in deep meditation. His legs held a wide stance and his outstretched arms progressed slowly in precise movements and in perfect sync with his torso.  He paid me no attention. 
Swords of all different shapes and sizes lay littered on top of the snow. Seth stood, with barely contained energy, in athletic shorts and a cut-off t-shirt. His biceps glistened against the morning sun with the warmth of his glow illuminating him in a soft haze. He clenched and unclenched his fists excitedly and bounced on his toes as if weapons training were the most exciting thing in life to him. 
I joined Seth, still recovering from little sleep the night before. I didn’t doubt I would work myself awake but training made me nervous. I knew I would learn how to use all of the different weapons and sooner than later a sword would feel like a natural extension of my body, but I was late getting started. Seth had been using swords forever, and he was an obviously skilled fighter. I pictured him as a toddler with little baby-sized daggers instead of rattles or stuffed animals. I on the other hand, had a fantastic jump shot, a killer spike and I could occasionally bend it like Beckham, however that wasn’t much to use against the Darkness, unless of course I challenged them to a game of Horse.
This day had been a long time coming’ but with the start of today was some seriously added pressure in that I only had a year and a half to learn everything there was to learn about being the Protector of Earth and become the skilled fighter I was supposed to be…. destined to be.
That wasn’t a whole lot of time.
I looked out at my father’s fields that rolled on for acres. The sun was just rising over the eastern hills and casting long shadows on the crisp and untouched snow. My footsteps followed Seth’s and Jupiter’s but other than our boot prints, the only other indentation made in the vast purity of white were animal tracks near the edges of the trees that lined the property. 
I decided there had never been anything more pure, more clean…. more wholesome. The ground glistened against the rays of the sun, sparkling like diamonds in the light of the morning. This ground, even though frozen, felt like me, symbolized my cause. A shudder trickled down my spine as I thought of how the Darkness would destroy this, take this unpolluted beauty away from Earth and swallow the goodness whole. 
Less importantly, I also wondered how training this morning would affect my father’s planting come spring.  
“Let us begin,” Jupiter called from where he stood with eyes still closed and palms still outstretched.
“Are you ready for this?” Seth asked me, his smile widening impossibly at the corners of his full mouth.
“Of course I am,” I groaned dryly, not willing to give in to my fears, but clearly not ready for any of this. “You’ll go easy on me right? It’s my first day and all,” I reminded him, hoping for some sympathy. “Plus, I’m a weak, fragile female. You don’t want to be a bully.”
“That’s true,” Seth conceded. “But I don’t like to lose.”
I laughed, believing him. “Me either,” I confessed, taking the challenge. 
“Seth, why don’t you take the broadsword,” Jupiter instructed. 
“Ah, man,” Seth grumbled. “You know I prefer the cutlass.”
“Which one is the broadsword?” I asked, taking a few steps forward to examine the weapons collection glinting brilliantly against the snow.
Seth picked up a sword, medium-sized in length and with a heavy hilt. He held it out for me to take and I nearly dropped it, not expecting that kind of weight. I caught my awed reflection mirrored in the shiny, deadly blade as I lifted it with both hands. I handed it back to Seth and then took a step back automatically when he began to swing it around his body as if getting to know the weapon in some intimate way I didn’t quite understand yet. His wrists rotated with easy, fluid movements, slicing the air with practiced clarity.
“And which one is the cutlass?” I asked out of honest curiosity.
Jupiter pointed to a longer, thinner sword that thickened at the end and rounded to a half moon point. I stared at it for a moment, trying to place why it seemed familiar. 
“That’s a pirate sword!” I exclaimed when the movie-marathon from the other night was recalled in my mind.
“Argh,” Seth grunted, sending me a sideways glance and an amused smile. 
“Stella you take the two-handed claymore and we’ll start with some basic technical movements,” Jupiter instructed, not even pretending to move forward to help me figure out which one he was talking about.
I winced while examining the collection in front of me. I hadn’t even realized, prior to five minutes ago, that so many different types of swords existed, let alone that they all had a different name. I had held my father’s battle sword before, but that was more like the one that Seth held now. Micah’s sword was a piece from heaven though, brandished in the lowest level and meant for the wars fought in other realms. His glowed with heavenly light, the same way the user did and was tasked with defending its Angel Warrior until the death. 
These swords were manmade and meant for practice and fighting battles on Earth. They would do the job that my father’s would, if I was ever called to fight with them, but they weren’t nearly as cool. After all they didn’t glow.
And to a Star, glowing was like the ultimate ability.
I took a tentative step forward, toward a sword with a hilt made like a cross. The blade rounded like the end of the pirate sword only from hilt to tip like a long crescent. Watching out of the corner of his eye, Seth cleared his throat, and tilted his head discretely to the left.
“That, young Starling, is a shamshir, and not what I asked you to pick up,” Jupiter reprimanded me, noticing my hand drop to my side at Seth’s warning. Jupiter bent down and picked up a sword with the same style of hilt, but with a blade that was straight like Seth’s. I had a hard time telling the difference between Seth’s broadsword and my two-handed claymore at first, but then I noticed the weapon I held was a little smaller and maybe easier to handle for a first-timer. 
Or for a girl.
Or maybe both.
Jupiter went on to explain what I already instinctively knew, “This sword is a bit lighter than Seth’s but will match up well when it comes into contact. Although keep in mind that it’s shorter than his, so you will need to give yourself some space. You will need to grip it with both hands, even if it’s lighter than Seth’s, it still has some weight to it. You’ll need both hands to maneuver it properly. At least in the beginning.”
I started to realize how heavy it was just while Jupiter was talking. Being a Star, I had access to supernatural strength, but I wouldn’t come fully into my powers until after I turned eighteen. My glow intensified as I let the inner-Star kick in and help wield my weapon. 
I gripped the leather-wrapped handle with both hands and held the sword in front of me, staring it down as if I could will its power into my abilities without having to struggle through the hard work and blood, sweat and tears part. But nothing happened. The doubled-edged blade stared back at me waiting for me to make the first move, not the other way around. 
Seth stepped forward, holding his weapon in front of him and lowered down into a crouched-ready-for-action position. I mimicked his pose, sinking back into my thighs, but staying alert on the balls of my feet, letting instinct lead the way. A smile played at the corners of Seth’s mouth, and his eyes twinkled devilishly. I couldn’t help but get distracted by the perfect lines of his jaw and the way his shoulders flexed with his readiness. It didn’t seem fair that I should have to train with an Angel…. maybe there was an uglier version of a training partner available? 
“Seth, make first contact, but tread carefully for now,” Jupiter instructed. 
All I had time to do was swallow my anxiety and brace my body in preparation for the hit. I flexed my arms, bracing for the impact before reaching my sword out to meet Seth’s in a swift, aggressive motion. Pride would not let me just hold a weapon and wait for the hit to come. Seth met my blade in the air, a little shocked by the force from my end and our two deadly weapons connected with clanging clarity. 
I stepped back with one foot, stabilizing my body while internally I felt like I was wobbling right along with the metal in my hand. I was shocked at how jarred I felt after just one hit, it was as if the hilt of the sword connected straight to my bones and felt the full strength of Seth’s swing. 
Still, I couldn’t stop the smile from spreading across my face as I realized how good combat felt. I liked to believe, being a Star, a lesser Angel, that I was made up of only good things. But the instinctive thirst to swing my sword again whispered otherwise. Blood thirsty wasn’t a word I was ready to throw around just yet, but I was created for battle, destined for war, I could learn to love this new aspect of my life. 
Easily.
Before Jupiter could instruct me further, I took the initiative and parted the locked weapons, noticing with satisfaction that Seth had become comfortable and had to adjust by taking a quick step forward. I raised my hands again and met Seth’s blade in the space between them with crashing finality. Seth was quick to recover and an almost criminal expression lit up his face. 
I stretched my Warrior instincts further and met Seth blow for blow, the quickness in my step and swiftness of my hands attributed to my supernatural origins. Our swords clashed between us as our feet made arching circles in the now disheveled snow-laden field.
I knew I had limitations. Beyond a friendly back and forth, I wasn’t prepared to make an all-out attack on Seth and the muscles in my shoulders and arms already started to burn with the unfamiliar movements and weight of the weapon in my hands. But it felt good to get a sense for the sword and I ached for the time when it would be second nature. That is until Seth stepped forward as if to strike at me and then at the last minute leapt into the air, flipped over my head and landed with his sword at the base of my throat. He stood close behind me, pressing me against his body with his sword loosely at my neck and his arm wrapped around my stomach.
Stunned and in jealous awe, I dropped my sword and raised my hands in the air. 
“You win!” I squeaked. The heat of his body pressed against my back and I relaxed my head against his shoulder, promising that it was just to get further away from his sword.
“Ah, you give up too easily,” Seth laughed in my ear, with a low, husky chuckle. He removed the sword from my neck and released me so I could pick up my discarded blade.
“Only the first time,” I promised back.
“It only takes one time to get yourself killed,” Jupiter ground out grumpily from his place a few yards away. “Again,” he commanded.
I readied my body again, and this time when Seth’s sword came at my head, I was quicker to defend myself. I let natural instinct take over and met his blows time after time with matched strength. I could tell he was going easy on me, letting me find my way around a battle field, but the feeling of power and strength was intoxicating, even at a beginner’s level.
Jupiter would stop us occasionally to critique my stance or hold, or technique and every great once in a while to reprimand Seth about his own performance. But for the most part, I learned what worked for me through trial and error. Expert skill would come with practice and use, but basic technique was something I had been born with.
Seth moved around me with the talent of a trained Warrior. His feet danced across the frozen ground, even buried up to his shins in snow. His sword moved easily from one hand to the next just as effortlessly as when he used both hands to wield it. The power and strength in his arms seemed to be endless, and the muscles in his arms from shoulder to wrist flexed with each movement he made and promised to be a serious threat when put to real use. He could jump, and flip and maneuver out of danger in a catalogue of acrobatic moves that made me excited to continue my training and just the tiniest bit jealous. He had to be the best of his kind for his age. I had no doubt. I had watched my father train before, in the same ways that we were now, and I knew that Seth shouldn’t be as good as my dad was for his age. I knew Seth shouldn’t already rival my father for skill.
But he did.
And he was shining magnificently with the effort of it.
Human boys could always be just as attractive as Warriors on the surface, but when Seth radiated from the core of his being the true power he held inside, there was something so brilliant and intoxicating about him I found myself way too distracted and way too often staring at him; I could only describe him as beautiful. His already golden skin shined with warmth, there was a glow of light surrounding him and the pupils of his eyes lit up with the thrill of the challenge. 
We worked like that for hours, so I could get acquainted with the huge arsenal of swords. Jupiter let me get the handle on the difference in a double-edged blade and a single, or a two-handed sword and a single without too many impatient outbursts. I was a bit clumsy, and more than a little slow, but I was getting the concepts and the movements. Seth was an easy partner to work with; he knew the weapon so intimately that every one of his calculated movements was thought out to allow for my beginner’s instincts. He was careful with me, instructive but also protective. I admired that about him, his willingness to teach me and not just train with me, but his inability to put me in harm’s way. Although there was a fight inside of me that hungered for a little danger.
“You have a long way to go,” Jupiter interrupted a back and forth battle between the two of us that had gotten competitively aggressive. 
Seth and I slowed our forward attempts and backed away respectfully. I caught my breath, and wiped my wet brow with the back of my hand. I’d been using all of my supernatural strength to stay in step with Seth, but still he seemed unbeatable. Even now, only one bead of sweat trickled from his hair line down his temple and I inwardly cursed him for remaining so perfect. He probably didn’t even feel the uncomfortable burning in his shoulder blades or the Jell-O-like feeling of his arms.
“But she’s not as bad as you expected her to be,” Seth chimed in, his eyes glinting mischief at me.
I didn’t know whether to be offended or elated.
“No, she’s not. But she’s not as good as I wanted her to be either,” Jupiter scoffed.
That time I knew exactly how to be offended.
“This practice is good for you if and when you face a Fallen. They are like you, they are flesh and blood and will need to be killed the same way you would destroy a man. Hand to hand combat will be very similar to Seth, only they will not be nearly as nice or forgiving. They will expect a skilled fighter and when you are presented to them as the opposite, they will murder you,” Jupiter explained and his words hung in the cold, still air like a death sentence.
“They will not get close to her while I am around,” Seth growled from across the circle we had been working in. His most basic instinct was to protect me and I breathed a bit deeper knowing that Jupiter’s warning came with a clause. The Fallen would murder me if they could get to me.  
Jupiter made a gruff grunting noise and changed the subject, “Shadows however, are not flesh and blood; not even when they manipulate our eyes. They are and will always remain part of the Darkness. Fighting them is less of a thrusting, side-stepping affair and more of a constant swinging of your sword. If you make contact with them, the only way to successfully destroy them is to slice them in half at the place where their life’s blood beats. I would call it a heart, but to attribute them with a feeling organ is to give them far too much credit.”
I waited quietly for Jupiter to continue, but after he remained silent with his eyes locked on me I decided he was waiting for me to demonstrate what I hadn’t realized were instructions. “So, like this?” I asked while swinging my arms back and forth in front of me. I quit when I realized my motion seemed more like Zorro marking a tree with his initials than an Angel putting evil to death.
“No, not like that,” Jupiter shook his head, clearly discouraged.
“It’s more like this,” Seth offered. He had exchanged his broadsword for the cutlass he was apparently fond of and took a step forward into the circle of tousled snow we made together. 
Seth swung his arms around his body, both hands gripped firmly on the hilt of his curved sword, in effortless, beautiful motions that reminded me more of a dance than a fight. His arms swung overhead and behind him before he brought them powerfully but efficiently to his side and then back and then to his other side. His wrists and hands always stayed relaxed; he made the movements look effortless, look easy. He moved his feet in quick, easy steps, kicking up snow in short bursts of blizzard white-outs that he would step through thrusting his sword forward at the same time.
I consciously closed my mouth, afraid that it hung open in awe of the intricacy of his skill. Seth never stopped moving his sword; it flew in every direction with precision and ease, he tossed it around behind him and over his head and back and forth catching it as easily as if it were a baton and he was a majorette. Only like a manly version. His forehead was furrowed, wrinkling in between his thoughtful eyebrows, his biceps stayed flexed and his feet danced around the snow as if his steps were well-rehearsed and choreographed. His eyes glanced up at me once, and they twinkled with excitement and concentration. 
“Oh, so that’s what you meant,” I remarked a little out of breath when Seth slowed down and ended his performance.
“No, that’s what I said,” Jupiter corrected me, not even trying to mask the tone of irritation that accompanied his words.
“Shadows can come at you from every way, and depending on the situation there can be hundreds of them attacking you all at the same time,” Seth explained more gently. “They do not have fear or restraint, so they will not stop. It is one constant action of attack. That is why your sword cannot stop moving either. Did you notice how I swung the sword in every direction, even behind me although I couldn’t necessarily see what I would be hitting?” I nodded my head. “That is because I don’t have time to find them, I just have to instinctively know that they are either there already or they will be shortly. The sword cannot stop moving. You must make every single swing a kill shot, or their attack on you will drive you mad or be the end of you,” Seth finished seriously and all I could do was swallow the lump in my throat and stare at Seth as he demonstrated the movements again.
“Every shot has to be a kill shot?” I asked tentatively, wondering if it was possible to get that good. Ever.
“Only if you want to live,” Jupiter chimed back in. I turned my attention to him and bit my bottom lip to keep from retaliating something equally as sarcastic. “The difference between Shadows and Fallen though, are that Shadows are not natural beings of creation. God did not create them; they are a byproduct of evil. Therefore most thrusts of a sword will slide right through that vital organ, as long as you make contact. It is possible to swing too high or too low, but as long as you are swinging you are going to stand a good chance of staying alive.”
“Well, there’s that,” I mumbled, readying myself to attempt the movements.
I gripped my weapon, the one that looked like a samurai sword…. a katana; I loved how it felt in my hands and the weight that was distributed over it. I began to swing it out in front of me, flicking my wrist around trying to mimic Seth’s relaxed movements. My actions felt awkward and ill-timed and when I attempted to swing the blade behind me things turned downright dangerous. More than once Jupiter and Seth had to jump out of the way or risk becoming a discarded Shadow among the remains of my pretend pile of enemies.
Shadows were supposedly the easier of the two enemies, but I was pretty certain I stood a better chance against the Fallen. At least I didn’t have to worry about hundreds of them advancing on me at once from every direction.
Or did I?
I wasn’t actually sure. I hadn’t even heard of a Star getting into an on planet battle with the Third. But I supposed it was possible, if enough of them were organized against Earth.
I stopped for a moment to realize there were enough of them to organize against Earth. Earth was it, the last planet with life, the last possible place for the Darkness to feed off of save for Heaven itself. So why wouldn’t they be organizing themselves to attack the planet?
Starting with the one Star sworn to never leave, to protect its inhabitants until there was nothing left to protect.
My pause caught the attention of my teacher and he stopped midsentence in instructing me to “try not to clomp around like a clown but learn to stay on the balls of my feet.” Moments ago I wanted to make a joke about Seth being a ballerina, but now all I could think about was that I could be the last Star to take a stand against the entire army of Darkness.
Or I would live a very, very, very short life and the Elders would send someone else after their careful mission failed.
Either way, I needed to focus.
I shook out my head and my eyes found clarity. I looked up at Jupiter who watched me for a second before returning to his lecture. Something passed between us, something deep and connecting. He understood a part of me I didn’t realize was so visible to others until that moment. 
Fear.
I felt fear. And I knew I wasn’t supposed to. 
Yet it was as if Jupiter was defying all of the history between humans and Angels. There was something in the look he gave me that was proud, that reveled in my ability to be anxious for my future. It was a wise look. A determined look. And even if he never spoke to me politely again, after that moment of realization, I felt like I understood him a little bit better too.
“Try it again, Stella,” Jupiter commanded, completely back to his old impatience and even older methods.
And I was fine with that. I knew Jupiter was what I needed in a weapons trainer; he was what had to be put in my life. I didn’t have time to be coddled, or given time to feel sorry for myself. I had a planet to protect. It was time to buck up and face the music. 
I just hoped I had time to learn my part before I faced it head on.

Chapter Seven

	I could feel all eyes on us as we walked into Mead High School on the first day back from winter break. Openly curious students watched us approach my locker with unmasked interest. I knew it wasn’t entirely for me, but the gathering crowd couldn’t keep their eyes off me and my new friend: Seth. They looked back and forth between us, two Angels appointed the duty of walking high school halls until graduation; at which time our fellow students would be off to college and we would battle the forces of Darkness. I sighed and wondered if they could see the other-worldliness transparent between us now that there were two of us. 
	Seth seemed completely oblivious to the attention he drew, students and faculty alike assessed him as though he were a new piece of equipment added to our school’s inventory and not a new student with potential feelings. I wondered if he was nervous for his first day of school with humans. He didn’t seem to be, and on the surface had no trouble fitting in with his relaxed jeans and long-sleeved gray polo. The ends of his hair curled in golden tendrils and he walked with his head held high and beaming with confidence.
	I twirled the end of a strand of hair around my finger, knowing there would be backlash for my association with the gorgeous new kid in school, starting with the drooling female population. I didn’t know if females school-wide would hate me for our bizarre relationship or stalk me…. but I knew without a doubt Seth would bring me all kinds of trouble.
	“Thanks again for coming back to pick me up this morning,” Seth broke my thought train as I unloaded my backpack into my locker. I had to keep shoving things back in it; I was suddenly super embarrassed with Seth watching the tragic disorganization that was literally falling out of my locker. 
	“Really, it’s Tristan you should be thanking, he’s the one who drove,” I replied, wondering if Seth was more nervous than he let on, since this was the fourth time he thanked me for a ride. “I won’t have basketball practice every morning, but at least this next week since coach wants us ready for our upcoming games. She thinks we get lazy over winter break. But we’ll probably have to carpool with Tristan for a while, until my dad decides what to do about my car situation.” 
	“Hopefully, I’ll get my own car too, soon,” Seth leaned back against the adjoining lockers and looked out into the sea of students who still seemed to be watching him openly. “Then you can ride with me.” 
	“Hopefully Jupiter is a little more charitable than my father,” I grumbled. The Jeep had been officially totaled, after my dad assured me Seth couldn’t keep holding the door on with his super strength while driving through town. A further discussion of not needing the door really at all had also been negated. But with the death of the Jeep, I knew it would be a long time before I could reinstate my vehicular freedom. Dad wasn’t known for buying things…. like anything. He usually preferred to make it.
	And even with his imaginative cheapness, I didn’t think he was quite cut out to make me a car.
	“Where we were before, I didn’t need a car, there was plenty of public transportation to get around on. But we also lived in a city…. like a real, populated city,” Seth explained further and I turned to ask him about what Boston was like, before a bouncing brunette with stylish straight bangs, and extra-large turquoise feather earrings interrupted our conversation.
	“Excuse me,” she sung, waiting for Seth to move out of her way. She had a little more tact than the rest of the student body in that she didn’t openly stare at Seth as though he were an animal caged in a zoo, but her lightly freckled nose crinkled in curiosity and her hazel eyes brightened with impatience.  
	“Oh, sorry,” Seth apologized, watching the girl’s ponytail bob from side to side as she waited. 
	“Hi, Pi,” I turned toward my female best friend and smiled at her. I knew Piper would have a million questions for me, starting with Seth and ending with where was Tristan, but I also trusted her not to blurt them out immediately.
	“Hey, Stel…..” she prompted, waiting for an introduction. “Who’s your friend?”
	“Piper Cassidy this is Seth…. Seth…..” I froze realizing I didn’t know the last name Seth went by or even if he had a last name. I panicked for a second while trying to rack my brain for the information I wasn’t sure if I had ever been given.
	“Seth Smith,” Seth finished, flashing his charming smile at my bemused best friend.
	“Seth Smith,” I echoed with confidence, biting back a laugh at the simplicity of his “taken” last name. “He’s an old friend of the family. He and his…. grandpa just moved here. Seth, this is my best friend, Piper.”
	“Nice to meet you Piper,” Seth extended his hand so Piper could shake it. “Stella you have a lot of best friends,” he commented curiously. 
	“Yes, she does,” Piper complained. “But none of us hold a candle to Tristan.” Piper said Tristan’s name as if it were a communicable disease and I watched Seth’s eyes light up in appreciation. It was obvious he immediately liked Piper. Great… they could make an “I hate Tristan club.”
	“That’s not true at all! You and Tristan hold equal candles.” I defended myself to Piper, closing my locker with extra emphasis. “And I only have two best friends. I like to keep things fair and honest, gender speaking, so I have one of each,” I smiled at Piper, knowing this would get on her nerves.
	“Oh, is that why you keep Tristan around? You’re an equal opportunity employer?” Piper pressed, rolling her eyes.
	“Exactly,” I laughed. “Seriously though, Piper’s always been jealous of Tristan because he was my best friend first.” I explained in good humor to Seth, but inwardly cringed. The rivalry between Piper and Tristan was nearly as old as we were and something I tried to balance daily. 
	“I’ve never been jealous!” Piper squealed, lifting a wrist covered in silver bangle bracelets in defense. “It’s not even a fair competition. You’ve known Tristan since you were in diapers. I had to wait all the way until kindergarten before I could step in and by that time he had wormed his way deep inside your generous little heart and refused to leave.” Piper was a mix of trendy bohemian and small town politics. I knew my friend would love to dress in peasant skirts and bold prints all the time, but she kept things conservative to balance her farmer heritage and sport’s star status. Today she wore a tight-fitting vintage Mead High School volleyball t-shirt that was probably her mother’s, a short, frayed denim mini skirt and thick black tights. The outfit itself was something any of the girls at school would wear, but no one else would pair it with shin-high tan furry boots, that looked like the needed to be brushed on a daily basis, two wrists full of sparkly silver bangles, bright feather earrings and a hoop nose ring. I felt boring standing next to her in black leggings and a turquoise sweater dress. I tried to imagine my simple grey Uggs with fur on them, but decided to let her have the glory of wearing small animals on her feet.
	“Poor Piper,” I sympathized, hugging my books to my chest and gave her a sympathetic smile. 
	When all I got in return was an irritated eye roll, I put my arm around my friend’s shoulders that stood almost exactly the same height as mine. Piper laid her head against mine and stuck out her full bottom lip in a pretend pout. Seth laughed with us; and I could tell by the way he looked back and forth between us that he was glad my friendship circle extended beyond Tristan. Boys.   
	“Hey,” Tristan joined us, flanked by his closest guy friends and rival athletic studs. I leaped from Piper’s side straight into Tristan’s arms, wrapping my arms tightly around his neck. He hugged me closely to him, whispering in my ear. “Hey, Stel.” His deep voice rumbled against my hot skin and I nuzzled closer, relishing the familiar feel and smell of him. 
I waited for three more seconds before stepping back and nodding to Tristan’s male best friends. Together the three boys dominated all sports and carried the most votes in popularity. But Tristan was king jock among them, he walked the halls with a confidence and carelessness that only those truly at ease could carry.  
	“Well, speak of the devil,” Piper mumbled, punching me in the shoulder and turning back to her locker. “I don’t get greetings like that.” 
I bit back a smile, knowing she would kill me if I hugged her like that and potentially messed up her hair.
	“Seth, this is Rigley Merrit,” I introduced Seth to the boy on Tristan’s right; he had deep, reddish brown hair that curled wildly at an unkempt length. His face was dusted in matching freckles and his boxer’s nose crooked to one side. He was a Mead athlete, born and raised, with high school boy biceps and a thick neck. But his freckles and pale green eyes kept a boyish look about him that I knew most girls could not say no to. He knew it too. “And this is Lincoln Chase,” I continued, introducing Seth to the other boy who had perfectly clear skin that grew lightly pink with any kind of attention. Lincoln was shorter than Tristan and Rigley by a few inches, but still an obvious athlete. His pale blonde hair was stick straight and hung across his eyes in a way that amplified his shy and reserved look. And as dangerous as Rigley could be, Lincoln was quiet and careful. “Guys, this is Seth, he just moved here,” I finished the introductions and waited for them to all acknowledge each other in turn. 
	“Are you headed to Government?” Tristan asked when not much had been made out of the consecutive handshakes. 
	“In a minute, I’m going to help Seth find the office first,” I explained.
	“Oh,” Tristan said surprised. He rubbed his hand over his shaved head and looked down the hallway a little lost. 
	“Save us a seat?” I prompted, knowing I was interrupting our daily routine. Tristan was still adjusting to Seth’s sudden appearance in my life, but I didn’t feel bad about making him walk to class on his own. It was just one class. 
	“Sure,” Tristan replied, not at all wanting to save us both a seat.
	“Tristan and Stella aren’t walking to class together?” Piper turned from her locker, dramatically pretending to be appalled with the situation. “What is happening to the world?” she cried out, holding her Government books up toward the ceiling and shaking them with mock outrage. “How will we ever go on?”
	“Piper, I missed you over winter break, how was Breckinridge?” Tristan goaded Piper with heavy tones of feigned sincerity. Deep down they loved each other…. or at least that’s what I promised myself when she turned snarky and he turned pretend polite.
	“It made me slow and lazy,” she admitted moodily, referencing practice a half hour ago and repeating our coaches exact words. 
	“You’ll catch up,” Tristan promised encouragingly but Piper only rolled her eyes and waved at us before marching off for class. There was nothing she hated more than when Tristan played nice. She refused to like him and preferred him to make it easy for her to hate him.
	“See you guys later,” I waved at everyone too, taking an amused Seth by the shirt sleeve and dragging him toward the school office.
	“Your best friends hate each other,” Seth commented when we turned the corner, clearly enjoying this revelation.
	“They don’t hate each other,” I tried to plead a useless case I had been fighting since grade school. “They just don’t always see eye to eye.” 
	“It’s just so unexpected,” Seth continued, the shock ringing in his voice. “The way you worship Tristan…. I just thought…. I mean I thought everyone loved him.”
	“Everyone does love him!” I quickly defended. “Except…. Piper….” I admitted, trailing off. “Piper just doesn’t like to like anything that everyone else likes and that includes Tristan….. and I don’t worship him! We’re just…. best friends.”
	“So I’ve heard, at least a thousand times since I met you,” Seth answered a little put off. “And I only met you a week ago!”
	“Whatever,” I laughed Seth off and opened the glass door to the school office.
	Three secretaries sat working busily at retro desks behind a light wood partition with a long gray peeling countertop. The entire office screamed late 70’s, even the secretaries in their polyester skirts and thick, tan nylons. I smiled at the three older ladies who had been working in this same school for as long as anyone could remember.
	“Mrs. Sadler, this is Seth Smith, he’s a new student here and needs to check in with you,” I explained sweetly, approaching the long counter with a trailing Seth.
	The three secretaries paused their work, fingers hovering over computer keyboards to gawk at the new student as blatantly as my classmates had. Mrs. Sadler, a woman in her late sixties recovered first, adjusting her thick framed cat-eyed glasses and pressing a hand to her graying French twist carefully. She stood quickly and walked to the counter with an unsure smile plastered to her overly made-up face.
	“Seth Smith?” she questioned shyly. 
	“Mmm-hmmm,” I answered in awe that this secretary was as unnerved as everyone else seemed to be by Seth. Mrs. Sadler was notorious for her quick temper and lack of patience, especially when it came to the student body. I had worked very hard to stay under her radar, but I was positive Seth wouldn’t have to try nearly as hard as I did to get away with late arrivals and absences.
	“Pleasure to meet you, Seth,” Mrs. Sadler practically giggled.
	“Thank you, you too,” Seth replied, giving her that big smile that seemed to work on every single female in the galaxy.
	“Let me just see if I can’t find you your class schedule, alright?” Mrs. Sadler continued to coo and then walked back to her computer. 
	I turned my back on the voyeuring secretaries and leaned against the tall counter. “Most of your classes will be with me; this is a really small school. There are only thirty-two of us in the whole junior class.”
	Seth nodded, his amber eyes piercing mine with gratitude. I wondered if he was anxious to get out of the awkwardness of the office and onto class, or if this whole experience was an unwanted nightmare. School was never something he had to think about before. Jupiter always tutored him, and with only a year and a half left before he could focus completely on Warrior-training, he probably hadn’t thought he would ever need to worry about it. But with the change of circumstances and his unwillingness to leave me by myself, high school and him would soon become old friends.
	Mrs. Sadler stumbled through finding Seth’s papers and then walked him in circles explaining them to him so many times. By the time she finally released us for class she had to write us a pass because the bell rang several minutes ago.
	“So this is high school?” Seth asked on our walk to Government. I had been right, we had most of our classes together, except during the period where I went to choir, Seth opted for weight lifting.
	Shocker.
	“This is it,” I agreed. “Super exciting, right?”
	“So far,” Seth nodded. 
	“Actually, I really like it here,” I admitted, dropping my voice lest the rest of the student body hear my confession and believe I was delusional. “Everyone’s really nice and we all seem to get along. The community is really small, but we’ve all known each other since forever so we didn’t really have any other choice but to like each other.”
	“Well, that’s a relief,” Seth laughed again. I didn’t know what his preconceived notions of high school were, but a small farming town was nothing like what they aired on TV and I thought he would feel better knowing that.
	I showed Seth to Government and introduced him to our middle-aged, frazzled teacher, Mrs. Trinker. Her short hair stuck up frizzy and unruly, and at least one side of her blouse was always untucked from her too-tight pencil skirt. Mrs. Trinker acknowledged the both of us kindly before letting us find our seats by Tristan and Piper, who despite not getting along always sat next to each other in an effort to share me. I ignored the hateful glances between them; just thankful Mrs. Trinker at least seemed immune to Seth’s charm.
	The rest of the morning followed in the same pattern. I helped Seth move from class to class, introducing him to the monotonous tones of scheduled high school. Seth seemed to actually enjoy school, he really liked learning from different teachers and everyone was really nice to him, especially the girls. 
	By lunch, I decided Seth was adjusting well to school and the other students seemed to be adjusting to the phenomenon of having a new student grace the halls and the blinding attractiveness that wasn’t found in the average male. Or at least I hoped so. The sooner the student body moved on from ogling Seth, the sooner I could feel better about unleashing him on the human population.
	“Does everyone at this school play basketball?” Seth asked, sitting down across from me with a heavy, full tray of food. Even in the dim lighting of the cramped cafeteria, I could see I failed Seth in explaining the do’s and don’ts of school lunch. I liked to eat too, but I could not understand three helpings of mystery loaf and instant mashed potatoes from the cafeteria buffet line.
	Maybe I should have warned Seth about the menu.
	“Pretty much,” Piper answered. “Everyone at this school plays every sport. There’s nothing else to do in this one-horse town.”
	“You don’t even know what that phrase means,” I laughed tossing a French fry at Piper’s face. She swatted it away and then picked it up and reached across me to dip it in her ketchup/mayo mixture and pop it in her mouth.
	“So I’m going to be the only one in the stands for your basketball game tomorrow night?” Seth asked, scooping up a bite of meatloaf with a healthy topping of mealy mashed potatoes and neon gravy.
	“No, there’s some art geeks and band nerds that will be there too just because there’s nothing else to do,” Piper offered sarcastically.
	Seth didn’t know any better so he relaxed while shoveling his fork in his mouth. 
	“Piper, if you weren’t so afraid of disappointing your parents you would be one of those art geeks!” I defended Piper’s social status insinuation. 
	“Not true!” Piper rebutted. “I just simply can’t deprive the world of my fantastic three-pointer!” 
	“Or your game-losing ability to foul out when we need you most,” I offered helpfully. Piper stuck out her tongue at me. “Besides, even the smiley faces you try to draw look evil.” 
	“Bleh!” Seth interrupted our giggling practically spitting out his last bite of food. “What is this?” he asked after forcing himself to swallow.
	“That is mystery meat,” Tristan explained, sitting down across from me and squeezing my hand familiarly with his hand. “And Stella should have warned you not to even bother with that….” Tristan eyed Seth’s plate with the first form of sympathetic camaraderie I noticed from him and my heart swelled just a little with the hope of a future friendship between the two boys. 
	“I didn’t know he was going to take three helpings of it!” I argued, holding up my plate of French fries and offering them to Seth.
	“The color of the gravy should have tipped me off,” Seth grumbled while Rigley and Lincoln joined us at the table next to Tristan. Our table had a very strict, unspoken rule and that was that boys sat on one side of the table and girls sat on the other. Seth was breaking the rule by sitting next to me, but being the rebel I was, I couldn’t make myself care. It was weird we still segregated ourselves, but such was small time life. Most traditions stuck around and this was something we started in kindergarten back when the opposite sexes had cooties.
	“Do you have a thing for radioactive sauces?” Rigley asked, eyeing Seth’s plate with everyone else.
	“Apparently,” Seth muttered. "Where are those chocolate chip pancakes when you need them?” He grabbed a fry off my plate, shooting me a grateful smile.
	“Do not bring those up if you want me to share my fries,” I warned.
	“Oh no,” Tristan gaped. “You didn’t eat her pancakes did you?” 
	“You ate her pancakes!” Piper chimed in, offering a horrified expression and a jingling hand over her heart.
	“I didn’t know they were such a big deal!” Seth held up both hands in surrender, laughing.
	“Which is why he was forgiven,” I conceded valiantly. “This time….”
	“Careful Seth, once when I spent the night and Annabelle made them for us, I took one too many thinking it was perfectly fine to be, you know…. hungry,” Piper explained dramatically, “and Stella didn’t talk to me for a week. Not until I made my mom drive over to Annabelle’s and beg her to make a special batch for Stella just so she would stay my friend.” Piper waved her fork around while she told the story and her lips pursed together in an expression that promised she was serious.
	“She’s lying to you Seth, don’t believe her,” I swore dryly and then added as a warning, “But seriously, don’t take my pancakes again.” 
	“Hello, Tristan,” a sickly sweet voice called from the other side of Piper. “Is this a new recruit for the basketball team?” Bree Henry asked innocently.
	Ugh. Bree Henry. Not that I completely disliked her. I couldn’t even if I wanted to. My position on Earth required me to love all of humanity…. But if I had been allowed just one human to place outside of the love I had to unconditionally give to this planet, she would definitely be my first choice. 
	“Hey, Bree,” Tristan replied casually. “This is Seth. Seth this is Bree.” Tristan made an uninterested gesture between the two so they could be considered formally introduced and I swallowed my irritation. 
	“Hi Seth,” Bree cooed, flipping her highlighted hair over her shoulder. “So you are another one of Tristan’s recruits?” 
	Both Tristan and Seth laughed at that. “I’m not a recruit,” Seth explained shooting Tristan a sideways look. “I’m not even here to play basketball. I’m just a regular student.” He shot Bree his charming smile and I had to take a sip of my water to keep from making a face. If only we shared a telepathic communication…. I could have assured him, she wouldn’t take much effort to charm at all. 
	“I don’t think there’s anything regular about you,” she purred with that gross voice she was always talking to Tristan in. 
	Rigley snickered across the table and Piper and I held back our laughter. I wanted Seth to form his own opinions about Mead and make his own friends so that he didn’t always feel like he was tied to me, but I might have to warn him about the biggest flirt in school. 
	Like about not becoming her friend.
	And calling her a “flirt” was very generous on my part. 
Seth shifted uncomfortably under Bree’s penetrating stare and gave me an uncertain glance. “So are you another one of Stella’s best friends?” he asked innocently.
	 Bree and I both let out a strangled laugh at the same time. She turned to stare at me for a second, malice thickening the air between us. I smoothed out my face and returned her glare with my sweetest smile, knowing I wasn’t taking the high road. She loathed when I was nice to her, kind of like Piper and Tristan. She preferred outright honesty and the fact that she made me her rival since the first day of kindergarten was not a secret. But, saving humanity and all, I was not really in a position to just come right out and say exactly how I felt about her.
	“We’re, uh, friends,” I replied, shifting my gaze to Seth’s because I knew Bree’s reaction would be vile. 
	Tristan, Rigley and Lincoln burst into laughter at that and Piper, who had somehow not incited the same hatred in Bree as I did, shook her head like she knew better. 
	“If by friends you mean we go to the same school, happen to be in the same grade and unfortunately have to see each other daily….” Bree made a disgusted sound in the back of her throat and ripped open her lunch bag with extra force. “Then yeah, we’re friends.” 
	Yikes. So obviously not best friends.
	“So who’s going to Lincoln’s after the game tomorrow night?” Rigley moved the conversation forward. Seth shot me an unsure glance and then went back to his radioactive lunch. Making high school enemies was so not on the list of acceptable Star-related activities…. 
	“Oh I’ll be there,” Piper replied dryly, “with bells on.”
	“Really?” Lincoln spoke up for the first time, his clear skin turning pink with the question.
	“Yes, really,” Piper nodded enthusiastically, “with actual bells on.”
	Lincoln looked back down at his sack lunch a little dejected, but didn’t offer a response to Piper’s sarcasm. I noticed the hint of disappointment in Lincoln’s demeanor and tried to salvage the situation.
	“Are your parents out of town again, Lincoln?” I asked, investigating the reason behind a Friday night, after-game party. Weekend parties were not an uncommon affair in Mead, there wasn’t much else to do and most of the kids had older siblings more than willing to provide illegal-underage refreshments for a price. But a party in someone’s actual house was kind of uncommon. Usually, Friday night was spent with a circle of truck beds backed up around a bonfire. Those were easy to avoid. A house-party was a special occasion and not so easy to make excuses for.
	“Yeah, Rigley refuses to waste an opportunity,” Lincoln replied, still staring at his lunch.
	“So you girls going or what?” Rigley asked bluntly.
	“I’m going!” Bree offered enthusiastically. “Liz and Kendall are too, as long as Kendall and Eli are still together…. Chances are they’ll break up before Friday night and then she won’t want to go. But there’s also a good chance they could break up and get back together before then too-“
	“Anyway,” Piper cut her off before we could hear anymore scenarios that involved Kendall’s possible attendance. “Let’s just count them all in for the party until we hear differently, k?”
	Bree rolled her eyes, but didn’t continue speculating about any more high school romances.
	The table fell silent for a moment before Tristan added, “Not everyone is going to be drinking, and you can bring Seth.” Tristan nodded over to Seth who had somehow managed to eat most of the lunch on his plate. “It could be fun,” Tristan added softly to me.
	“Maybe,” I conceded, wondering how Seth would react to a bunch of drunken teenagers pulling small town shenanigans like Tipsy-Cow-Tipping on a farm in the middle of nowhere.
	“Depends on if we win or lose,” Piper decided.
	“Which way?” Lincoln tried again and I had to hold back my smile at his obvious interest in Piper.
	“That depends too, my friend,” Piper answered noncommittally and then got up to throw the remains of her lunch away.
	Something moved across the ceiling…. something long, thin and black. A wisp of charcoal smoke moved with purpose; I saw the Shadow out of the corner of my eye, like a dark cloud in my peripheral. I whipped my head around to catch the demon in action, but it already disappeared before my eyes could find it. And then again, from the other side of the cafeteria, a puff of evil that slithered along the wall, a sadistic snake shape that slipped away to nothing before I could focus on my enemy.
	“Are you Ok, Stel?” Tristan asked, as he watched me whip my head back and forth, my golden skin turning pale.
	“Fine,” I turned to give him a reassuring smile and when I did the Shadow was back on the ceiling, paused and unmoving as if watching me. 
	I turned my head slower this time, sure I would miss the apparition, but there it stayed. The black tuft of smoke discolored the white tile and sent the faint smell of sulfur burning my nostrils. Goose bumps raised the hair on my forearms, and a sickening, nauseous feeling settled in the pit of my stomach. The Shadow didn’t move or flinch as I stared back, and although it did not have eyes per say, the head of the demon seemed to watch me intently, as if egging me on…. daring me to react. 
	I watched the Shadow for a second before turning to Seth to get his attention. He already saw it though, and stared intently at it. I felt his knee bounce up and down furiously as he tried to restrain his Warrior instinct and go after it, his entire body tensed with the effort not to go to battle. I wondered if there was a sword or dagger hidden in his casual outfit, a school sized one for school sized incidents. 
	Eventually the Shadow faded away, into the ceiling and the room returned to normal. The behavior was strange though, and I couldn’t help but wonder if the night when Seth appeared in my life, when Sidra died, if the nature of this war hadn’t changed in some way…. some terribly epic way that even Jupiter wouldn’t be able to prepare me for. 
	Shadows were supposed to influence evil from a distance. They were called Shadows for a reason; they were never seen, only glimpsed at. And they were never out rightly threatening, only influential manipulators. 
	My gaze fell back to Seth who was watching me closely as though my life were in immediate danger. His brilliant eyes glowed with his supernatural power and the warmth of his skin had picked up hues of gold. I smiled at him reassuringly, hoping to remind him he was in a room filled with humans, but it only softened his intensity a little.  
	Something was going on. And we needed to figure out what. 
	Preferably before my game tomorrow night.

Chapter Eight

	“Hey, great game!” Tristan stopped me on my way to the locker room. The varsity boys’ team waited against the gym wall to start warm-ups while the varsity girls’ team cleaned up the rest of our discarded water cups and towels and cleared the gym floor.
	“Thanks!” I gasped, still breathless. I wiped my still sweaty forehead with the back of my hand and placed both hands on my hips completely exhausted without the benefit of my supernatural powers. “They were good.”  
	“Not as good as you,” Tristan smiled smugly, like he personally had something to do with our win. He moved a basketball back and forth casually in his hands and kept his intense gaze on me. His gaze was always intense lately, as if he had to watch me constantly or I would disappear into thin air. Sometimes his over protectiveness would get on my nerves, but this look, this new look wasn’t so much platonically possessive as it was…. I didn’t really know what it was. I felt my blood heat under my skin and found the need to defuse the moment with humor.
	“Well, that’s a given,” I boasted sarcastically. “But seriously, they were tough. How is their guys’ team?” 
	“They’re rated number nine this year. They started out the season slow, but before break they killed Scribner-Snyder, who is rated higher than us…. so we will see. Lincoln and I have some tricks up our sleeves though, I think we’ll do pretty good tonight,” Tristan smiled confidently, glancing over at his opponents who were filing out of the visitors’ locker room in an adrenaline surging warm-up routine.
	“Of course you will,” I promised encouragingly. “Watch out for number seventeen though, his sister played middle too but she kept taking these random three-pointers and catching us off guard.” 
	“I saw that,” Tristan agreed, his eyes narrowing in focus. “Piper looked pretty pissed about it.”
	“That’s because Piper is super possessive about her three-point record, even if they’re on the other team. Trust me, I haven’t even tried to take one since junior high,” I noticed the rest of my team had disappeared into the locker room and were probably waiting on me for the after-game pep talk from Coach. “I better go. Good luck though! I expect to be acknowledged after every good shot. Tonight I’m thinking I want a 360 dunk, while you…. bark like a dog.” 
	I laughed at our pre-game tradition. Before every one of our games, I came up with ridiculous scenarios and if they were winning by a lot Tristan would try to incorporate them into the game in his own tamed down version. In his last game he had performed a tap-dancing jig while trying to throw the ball inbounds and then clucked like a chicken during a set of free throws shot by the opposing team. His teammates thought he was crazy and his coach only tolerated his antics because he was so good at winning games.
	“What is with all these sounds now? It used to just be fancy moves! Next week I’m going to have to sing opera or recite the pledge of allegiance,” he shook his head at me, but was laughing and I knew I had already won. 
	“Those are great ideas!” I agreed energetically and gripped his bare bicep before moving around him. “I’m going to remember those.”
	“Hey!” he called before I could walk away. “Lincoln’s party tonight? What do you think?”
	“Throw in some opera in the second half and I’ll go,” I negotiated, wondering if this party was a good idea, but Tristan seemed to really want me to go. 
	Tristan shook his head at me and then took off onto the court when the official warm-up music came blasting through the gym speakers. I paused to watch as he led his team out, dribbling a basketball in a wide arc before running toward the backboard and tossing the basketball hard against the Plexiglas screen so the guy behind him could jump up, catch it and repeat the move down the line.
	Something like pride bubbled up inside me as I watched Tristan maneuver around the court and command the attention of his team. He wasn’t a Warrior, but he was a truly gifted human athlete and he was mine. 
	Well not mine. 
	He could never be mine. I belonged to a destiny that didn’t include high school boys, or best friends…. or really anyone else besides Seth.
	But right now he was my best friend. And if he wanted me to go to Lincoln’s party tonight I really couldn’t tell him no…. even if there was a nagging feeling in my gut that warned me something ominous hovered overhead. 
  	I shook out my knotted, sweat-soaked ponytail and bounded into the locker room, ignoring my instincts and trying my best to focus on Coach Litz’ victory speech. 

----

	“I think I could play that sport,” Seth mused as we walked into Lincoln’s farmhouse that was full of rowdy teenage life. The party was extra lively after two winning varsity games and the first week of school after winter break being over. Lincoln’s parents were some of the wealthier farmers in the area so his house was only a couple years old and sat on two thousand acres of land. 
	“I think you could too,” I agreed, knowing as an Angel he could really do anything he wanted, including varsity basketball.  “The hardest part of the game is staying human. I mean, initially that’s the hardest part of the game and then after that it depends on where your strengths are.”
	“I can see why you use these sports to train though, they seem very…. invigorating,” Seth offered, sounding more like Jupiter than himself.
	I laughed as the rest of our group gathered around us inside, “Make sure you report that back to Jupiter for me.”
	“What about Jupiter?” Piper asked, pulling her long dark hair over her shoulder. Her copper bangles jingled around her wrist, matching the bronze beadwork of her hot pink, stylish tunic.
	“It’s big, right?” I replied vaguely, changing the subject.
	“Super big, weirdo,” Piper laughed sending me a curious look. 
	“So this is what underage drinking looks like?” Seth asked while taking in the wild teens in front of him that had turned Lincoln’s living room into a dance floor. Lincoln sat perched on the top of the staircase leading upstairs watching with restrained horror as Rigley’s party turned destructive on his parents’ expensive home. 
	“Well, this is what small-town underage drinking looks like,” Piper explained with obvious tones of disgust. “When it’s cold outside at least…. in the summer we prefer cornfields and bonfires. It’s so much more high class.”
	“Where do you guys get the alcohol?” Seth asked, not necessarily judging but clearly interested. Red plastic cups were passed between students who drained them of their contents and then hurried back to the kitchen for more. 
	“The creek,” Tristan spoke up for the first time. He had been unusually quiet as he watched the festivities unfold from the doorway to a dark sitting room. I kept my eyes focused on Tristan, knowing that if I looked beyond him I would see outlines of couples in positions and situations that I would never be able to erase from my memory.
	“The creek?” Seth asked, unsure if he heard correctly.
	“Yeah, Rigley and some of the other guys keep their booze in a cooler, tied up down by the creek on his dad’s property. The water keeps everything cold,” Tristan explained as if it should be obvious.
	“That is the most hillbilly thing I have ever heard,” Piper sighed and Tristan grinned at her.
	“Where do you keep your booze?” Seth asked Tristan directly, his honey colored eyes flashing with the challenge. 
	“I don’t have any booze to keep,” Tristan replied casually, but his own green eyes hardened in response. This was an unspoken argument over my virtue and I recognized it immediately.
	“Someone should go console Lincoln,” I changed the subject and gave Piper a suggestive glance. “Just promise him we’ll help clean up everything tomorrow.”
	“Why do I have to go?” Piper whined, tipping her head back so that her straight bangs flopped to the side. 
	“Because your butt looks hot in those jeans!” I shouted over the music, smacking her directly in the discussed area.
	Piper shot a hateful glance over her shoulder and then stomped through the middle of the makeshift dance floor in her knee high Muk-Luks. She sat down next to Lincoln with an unsatisfied plop and gestured at the house. I smiled at the way Lincoln’s cheeks pinkened and the way he tried to brush his stick straight blonde hair out of his eyes. They were adorable. If only Piper would admit it.
	“So what do you do at these parties if you don’t drink, Stella?” Seth asked, assuming correctly that I wouldn’t partake in underage drinking. Not that I was trying to be stuck up about it or anything, but the fate of the Universe and all….
	“Oh you know, this and that, sometimes I drive kids home, sometimes I get to hold hair back when they’ve had a little too much to drink and sometimes I try to talk them out of ridiculous stunts that usually involve Rigley trying to jump off something extremely high in order to prove his manhood,” I shouted loudly over the music that increased in volume with the popularity of a recent pop hit.
	“And sometimes you dance,” Tristan reminded me by reaching for my hands and pulling me to the dance floor.
	“And sometimes I dance,” I called back, giving Seth a smile before turning to Tristan. 
	We moved to the middle of the living room and joined in the merriment. His hands moved around me as they had for years, it was casual, a friendly activity that we’d done since we were old enough to starting coming to these things. Or at least it used to be…. something in Tristan’s eyes reminded me that things had changed, and not just in my life, but in our relationship. 
	The upbeat pop song turned into something slower, sexier and Tristan’s movements matched the beat. A flutter spread its wings in my stomach and I let Tristan lean in and hold me to him. He pulled me closer still, splaying one hand across my lower back. I stumbled forward into him, surprised by his boldness, and the heat of his hand cementing my body to his. I looked up into his emerald green eyes and realized this was exactly where I wanted to be.
	Tristan’s other hand came to rest on the side of my neck, palming my throat in his huge hand. He held me possessively, intimately and kept my chin tilted toward his face the just his thumb. I shivered under the feel of so much of his skin touching mine. His full lips parted for a second, his tongued swiped across his lower lip and I followed every part of that movement as if hypnotized. Eventually I turned my gaze back to his and he met me there, paralyzing me in his stare.
	He gazed back for a moment, as if he was as transfixed to me as I was to him. The rest of the dance floor faded away and an unfamiliar kind of confusion settled over me. There was something in that look that I didn’t or couldn’t or wouldn’t understand. I was hyper aware of every place his body touched mine, and especially of his strong hand holding me against his body. His fingers pushed against my back, melting me to him. His hard, firm abs were pressing against my own stomach, my chest against his chest. My thighs and hips against his…. I could smell him, feel him…. kiss him….
 As quickly as we fell into the bewitchment, we fell out. Tristan let me fall away from him, taking his hand off my back and grabbing my hands instead. Sensual turned to platonic and our bodies moved numbly to the beat of the song. His face turned from penetrating to playful and he flashed his warm smile at me, letting me know we were still safe as friends.
	And I inhaled again, not realizing I had stopped breathing.
	My eyes floated to Seth, like I was searching for punishment for the brief moment between Tristan and I, but Seth wasn’t looking at me. A surge of something unfamiliar settled in my chest as I noticed Bree Henry hanging on his arm. She was talking fast and flipping her hair in the flirty way that usually got her attention. But then I relaxed when I realized he wasn’t looking at her either, or even paying her any attention at all. 
His eyes had found something more interesting to watch. My gaze followed and I inhaled sharply at the scene. A dark circle of Shadows swirled around the ceiling watching the party down below. They were mostly obscured by the dark room, but Seth and I knew what to look for. An involuntary shudder slithered down my spine as the numbers of Darkness grew overhead. They whipped their bodies in excited movements, switching their back ends as if they were tails, reveling in the debauchery and drunkenness. 
	This was not my first party and I had witnessed the power of Shadows to manipulate and encourage teens under the influence before. But never had I seen such a collection of evil, save for the other night when they attacked me. Usually they appeared in partners or groups of three or four. Not clustered groups of twenty and thirty at a time, feeding the atmosphere with their dark presence.
	Their slithering, black bodies weaved back and for across the ceiling, spreading their malevolence and evil in a thick cloud of angry dissension. The tension in the atmosphere settled on the dancing crowd slowly, filling my nostrils with sulfur and death. I choked on the intensity of the evil, watching as the crowd turned from their victory party to angry shouting and physical violence. Two boys from my class shoved each other aggressively, while others around them shouted their approval. Even Tristan turned from me to watch the fight destroy Lincoln’s living room with a sinister smile twisting his expression.
	I moved to Seth’s side, desperate to fix the situation. The deadly blade I concealed against my thigh burned and itched with the desire to be used. Seth’s infuriated gaze settled on me and with a nod of his head, I followed him silently out the door. 
	“What do they want? I’ve never seen them like this before!” I demanded breathlessly. 
	The clear Nebraska winter sky sparkled with Stars from one horizon to the next and the ice cold air was a fresh and cleansing. I looked desperately upward at the Stars overhead as if they could feel my fear, wanting nothing more for them to collectively light up together and banish the Darkness from this planet forever. Death by a million suns seemed perfectly befitting for the evil lurking around this planet…. If only there was a way to protect humanity at the same time. 
	I knew there was an infinite battle to fight, a war that would go on until the end of time, but those were my friends inside, they were people I loved and cared for. The Darkness just made this personal. 
	“I think they’re taunting you….” Seth confirmed what I feared.
	A loud crashing sound resounded into the crisp, frozen night and I shuddered from all the possibilities that could be taking place inside. 
	“We need to draw them outside,” I announced, turning from Seth to unsheathe my blade modestly. It was smaller than ones I trained with before, just convenient enough to hide under a mid-thigh denim skirt and black leggings. Although I realized now how impractical the skirt was if I intended to take this fight to the sky.
	“Are you ready to fight?” Seth asked calculatingly from a few feet away. His eyes narrowed against me and I knew he was trying to decide if I was ready to face them or not. 
	“Are you ready to let this continue?” I countered, gesturing with my chin toward the sound of increased violence and mayhem. 
	“Are you comfortable in the sky?” Seth’s eyes blazed into golden beams of light and I noticed his hands twitching with the anticipation of battle. 
	“I’d do better on the ground,” I admitted. I could fly, or at least I had flown before, but never in battle, never when the lives of others depended on me. Never when my own life depended on my ability.
	“Ok, I’ll draw them out and herd them behind that line of trees. I’ll be right behind them, but you’ll have to initiate contact. I’ll use light to get them out of the house, but hold off with yours until the very last second, otherwise they’ll scatter. Except that….”
	“Except that what?” I prompted, afraid I already knew the answer. Another crashing-breaking sound echoed into the still night around us and I jumped from the nerves skittering around my quickly heating blood.
	“Except I have this bad feeling that they came here specifically for you….” Seth turned to me, placing a strong hand on my arm and squeezed. His golden eyes shimmered in the darkness and his body had a haze of light reflecting off the snow. “Stella, there are not enough to kill us inside the house, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t more…. out there. Remember everything we’ve gone over in training. Do not get distracted; focus on the constant movement of your sword. Relax your wrists.”	
	I struggled to swallow but managed to nod my head so that he knew I understood. 
	“Ok, I’ll meet you behind the trees,” Seth smiled warily as if he had fought a thousand battles before tonight. “And Stella?”
	I sucked in my bottom lip and waited for more instructions. 
	“I’ll be there to protect you. No matter what, I will be with you,” Seth squeezed my arm again and then jogged up to the house.
	With the confidence I had in Seth I somehow willed my feet to move away from the house and toward the tree line. I sucked in a deep, frozen breath and picked up my pace through the snow covered field. Lincoln’s property was big enough that if we could get the Shadows behind the tree line, we would be out of sight from the house and the party that was quickly growing aggressively violent and out of control.
	I picked up my pace and willed my jitters under control. I knew bravery and courage stirred my blood, but this was my first battle, the first time I would use my powers in an offensive attack against the Darkness. Adrenaline surged in my heart and suddenly excitement pounded in my pulse, beating against my eardrums and throbbing in my throat. 
	I was a born Warrior, bred for this purpose. The Darkness belonged under my submission and the evil that haunted my friends deserved retaliation. 
	Behind the tree line I breathed deeply, quieting the brilliant glow of my true nature and readying myself for the attack. I focused on blending into the obscurity of the dark night, not that I wanted to be invisible, but the temptation to glow with the brightness of the sun pricked at the back of my neck. I closed my eyes for a moment, letting the frozen night settle over me.
	I flung my arms across my chest, popping both of my shoulders into place and then I readied my stance and steadied my sword. I swung it out in front of me, letting my hands remember the fluid motions I had been practicing and then stilled so that I would be prepared for what would come next.
	The first shrill cry sounded from near the house and I felt the presence of Darkness move toward me like black lightning. Another screech piercing the quiet night and the hairs on my neck stood straight as I waited. Quickly the scent of sulfur and burning flesh filtered over me and I barely had a last moment to prepare myself before the shrieking Shadows appeared like a hundred bats startled from a cave. 
	They swarmed over me, breaking the tree line and poised for attack. Their thick ranks obscured the night sky so that I was wrapped up in utter darkness. There were obviously more Shadows waiting in the tree line than there were inside Lincoln’s house, because I was surrounded on every side by hundreds and hundreds of demons. I froze; frigid, bone-deep fear paralyzing every part of me. 
Until I saw the bright, golden light following them; Seth, the only light cutting through their thick blanket of black, the only physical thing that broke up the Darkness. His pure, unadulterated light was like a symbol of hope, like a single lighthouse on a stormy sea. I pulled myself together, grasping at whatever courage lay beneath the palpable layers of fear and released the inner most part of me. Suddenly I was as bright and shining as Seth, I was the goodness and light that violated everything the Darkness was. In that moment, I became the Star I was born to be. 
	The Shadows that were swooping down at me instantly retreated from my light and I burned them, but only for a minute. The same way their ice cold evil tore at my flesh, my light injured them igniting the scent of more sulfur, more dead, rotten flesh. Soon the little demons braved my burning glow and moved through the air to attack me. I twisted my wrist into a constant unbroken motion of attack, stepping forward through the snow and lashing out at the evil surrounding me. 
	I connected with the first Shadow in a sickening slice of demon flesh. The Shadows moved lithely through the air, so I expected their skin to be more wispy or…. cloud-like. But my weapon connected with actual flesh and as the blade sunk deeper into the Shadow, I was sprayed with fowl smelling black goo. I shuddered violently, wiping at my face before lifting my sword again. The Shadow I struck did disappear into the night once it was successfully destroyed but hundreds more had filled its place and I had to work to focus on anything but the rotting smell of slime covering my arms and face. 
	I swung out in dance-like movements, fluid and fast. I realized now why a longer sword was more practical, but worked with what I had. Seth was across the field, his battle-ready body radiant in the night and moving nimbly with his efforts to kill. The inhuman screams squealed with each demon’s life and the temperature of the winter night dropped drastically lower with their evil presence affecting everything around them. 
	I was not without injury as the Shadows attacked from every angle, and every direction. Their ice cold tendrils cut away at my flesh from behind and my back felt as though I had been given forty lashes medieval-torture style. The backs of my legs felt too exposed to the Darkness as well, as they were sliced and cut. The coldness of Evil seeped through my blood as my injuries remained untreated, but the warmth of the light inside me stayed the damaging effects and the adrenaline coursing through my boiling blood helped keep me focused and alert. 
	A guttural sound came from across the field and my eyes lifted off my attackers to Seth as he fought skillfully from a few yards away. My arms swung out in imperfect and awkward but deadly motions as I watched him kill one demon after the other. His sword was smaller than normal too and so he was sprayed in the decaying ooze of evil, the black tar-like blood spotting his ethereal glow as he lit up the sky around him. 
	I turned back to my opponents as they lessened their attack, their efforts futile against our light and our swords. Even as they attacked us the light from within us singed and burned at their flesh, likewise my own skin, and blood felt iced over and slow from the damaging effects of their deadly flesh against mine. Still I fought on, counting each demon’s death as a victory. 
Even though there had been hundreds of them, they never stood a chance against us; but blinded by bloodlust and Darkness they attacked relentlessly and now they lay at our feet fading into nothing, their sticky black blood spatter speckling the melting snow. 
	With one more, awkward plunge I finished off the last of the Shadows near me. I dropped my arm to my side and winced when the reality of pain settled in my muscles and bones. It wasn’t an effort that would go down in history books but I had survived my first fight. And I would live. 
	Seth still battled a dozen of the last of the Shadows and I decided to suck it up and help him, although he was much more practiced than me. His blade swung around him without pause or hesitation in beautiful graceful motions, never letting one Shadow passed his defenses. His sword instinctively knew when to whip around his back or plunge forward into the air surrounding him. My mouth dropped a little at the master-level of skill he seemed to command. He was my Warrior, my Counterpart and nothing would get passed him. 
	I gave a heavy sigh, not wanting to give up watching him to throw myself back into battle, and took a step forward when something caught my eye. I swung my head to the tree line that hid our battle from the humans inside Lincoln’s house. In the obscurity of darkness I thought I saw two shadowy figures watching us. I stared longer, waiting for the apparitions to disappear and if they had been Shadows they would have. But these figures stayed perfectly still, taking in our skill and watching Seth as he finished the last of the evil off. A gray, fuzzy hue surrounded them and it was the only reason I could see them through the tree cover. A shiver of anxiety worked its way from my toes to the nape of my neck and I had just decided to pursue them when they stepped back out of my visibility completely. 
	I hesitated, watching a glint of gold through the thick forestry. It wasn’t a blinding glow or even a substantial light, it was the dim gold of light that had been hidden for a very long time; maybe it never shined correctly. 
	It was the indistinct glow of a Star.
	That meant the gray haze was from the Fallen.
	And they were watching us.
	But that didn’t make sense because a Star wouldn’t be with the Fallen unless they were in battle. And the Fallen wouldn’t just watch as Seth and I destroyed so many Shadows, they would engage us. Or run. 
	I had to have imagined it.
	I turned my head back to Seth as he finished off the last of the Shadows near him. Their eel like bodies littered the snow at his feet, oozing sticky piles of slime on to the melting piles of snow around them before disappearing from this world to be banished to Hell for the rest of eternity. 
	“Did you see them?” I tilted my head toward the trees, finally feeling the Darkness completely retreat. Seth and I were alone.
	“See what?” Seth asked as he wiped the dirty blade of his sword against his thigh. 
	“I think there were people watching us. Maybe Fallen. There was some light when they left. It wasn’t bright, but I saw it,” I explained, hoping he believed me.
	“Interesting,” Seth sighed, closing the distance between us. Up close I could see the splatter of thick, black blood across his chest and shoulder blades. His hands were coated in the heavy sludge, and his face was speckled and smeared, but his clear, golden eyes were shining brilliantly, brighter than I’d ever seen them. Other than that, he looked relatively unharmed and his expression flashed with the pride of victory. “We should find your parents and Jupiter immediately. I’m sure they will want to know what happened.” 
	I nodded weakly. 
	Seth took another step forward as if unsure of himself and then pulled me into a hug. “You did good, Stella,” he whispered proudly in my ear. “It’s overwhelming the first time, but you did really, really good.”
	I tried to speak but winced instead from his arm across my back. Seth instantly let go, turning me around and lifting my sweater away from my body. I wanted to feel embarrassed, but my back felt completely shredded, as if the skin was just barely hanging on. The backs of my legs, too, felt like they had been sliced by thousands of razor blades from my Achilles heel to my thighs, the numbing cold of evil inundating my veins and leaving me stiff and frozen. 
	“Let’s get you home,” Seth said seriously and my stomach clenched at the level of concern in his voice. 
	“Is it that bad?” I asked, ready for the truth.
	“What the stench? Oh yeah, it’s pretty bad,” he smiled, lightening the mood. “And you look really gross; I can’t even tell what color your hair is anymore. Plus, you have a few paper cuts on your back that might need to be looked at.”
	I forced a smile, thankful for his candid nature. He smiled back, but the apprehension was still obvious in his eyes. 
	“Were you this bad in your first fight?” I winced, hoping for some camaraderie. 	
	“Oh no, I’ve barely ever gotten a scratch,” his smile turned wicked and if I had any strength left I would have punched him. “But I’ve generally used bigger weapons than your little baby sword.”
	“It’s the only thing that would fit under my skirt!” I protested, my breath wheezing out unstably. I sucked in a sharp breath when I let my weight lean into Seth; the pressure of his arm against my torn apart skin was almost too much.
	“Maybe it’s time to get a bigger sword,” Seth mused, gently slipping an arm under me. “And a longer skirt.”
Chapter Nine

	“You need to go to the High Council,” Jupiter argued from the kitchen table. I lay on my side, listening to the grownups heated and muffled discussion of tonight’s events from my bedroom. “They need to start an investigation immediately. There is a spy in their midst and your daughter’s life is at stake…. the future of this planet is at stake.”
	I cringed, hating that my parents had to defend the orders they were given. They weren’t staying on planet to put me in more danger; they were staying near me to protect me until I could efficiently protect myself. But Jupiter wasn’t seeing their perspective; the possibility of a traitor hiding amongst the elders was dividing the argument down the middle.
	But my parents had been ordered to stay. There was nothing they could do and no need to argue. I couldn’t offer my opinion though since I had been ordered to stay in bed, healing salve applied to each wound and sore. I bit my bottom lip to keep from shouting my opinion down at them.
	I was their daughter, but heavenly orders came first. Every Star and Warrior understood that this call was greater than us, greater than our familial responsibilities. Obeying orders was our first priority.
	Except what if our “call” had been compromised?
	What if our orders were coming from the traitor?
	“I have already sent word. For now we cannot leave Stella alone!” my father answered Jupiter’s demands with a raised voice, completely out of character for him. If you were not part of the Darkness, he had unending patience for you. And if you were part of the Darkness…. well, then you usually didn’t last long enough to see his temper elevate. Jupiter was on the rare receiving end of a deadly Warrior who had lost any last modicum of tolerance.
	“Sending word is no longer good enough!” Jupiter argued. “You need to make sure, no…. you need to stand over them until a course of action is decided! Staying here is only going to continue to put Stella and Seth in danger. They are…. they are…. what is that phrase…. they are standing turkeys until we do something! I would go there myself if it didn’t mean I had to die first!”
	“Ducks,” my mother offered sweetly. “Sitting ducks.” 
	A long silence followed her correction and I imagined Jupiter staring her down from underneath his bushy white eyebrows, seething with irritation. I took the opportunity to try and shift into a more comfortable position, but I ended up pulling at the bandages covering my back instead. I clutched at the sheets around me and winced from the movement. 
	In the morning, my back would be healed, or so I was told. But it was going to be a very long night. Even my veins hurt.
	“Maybe we send the children home, until they have fully trained,” Nathaniel, the temporary Warrior offered. 
	Serena and Nathaniel had been called to account for their absence during our fight from my parents and Jupiter who had been furious with them. They were the stand-in Protectors until we were properly trained and should never have left us to the battle tonight alone. Their instincts and powers should have alerted them to our fight, should have cried out to them to come to our aid, but they unexplainably heard nothing.  
	Granted they had a busy night, fighting off Shadows all over the world that seemed to be acting up in a way of a decoy. But they still should have felt our need and the concentrated effort of so many Shadows in one place. The silence they experienced was eerie and very unsettling. Unless the married couple was a part of this traitorous conspiracy, something was going on that none of us nor the Council in Heaven could fully understand.
	I swallowed the lump in my throat and tuned out the angry replies from both my parents and Jupiter at the suggestion Seth and I retreat to heaven. I found myself stuck on Nathaniel’s words though, “home.” I had never been to the lowest level of Heaven where every other Star called home, so it didn’t feel like home to me. In fact, the idea of hiding away in what might as well be a different dimension and leaving this farmhouse, my real home, sounded awful.
	“At least they all agree,” Seth smiled sarcastically as he slipped into my room otherwise soundlessly.
	“Yeah, it sounds like it,” I croaked out weakly. 
	Seth leaned against the closed door, with his hands behind his back looking uncomfortable surrounded by the girlyness of my room. I forgot I was eavesdropping for a moment as he stood there staring at me, his honey colored eyes settling on mine in a mischievous way that sent a shiver over the core of my body.
	It didn’t help that he was shirtless and wearing his low-riding sweatpants that made his hip bones pop out provocatively. I smiled to myself wondering how such a representation of all things good and wholesome could look like that much trouble all packaged up and ready to bring out my daddy’s shot gun. 
	If he was not my Warrior, now would be the time to start worrying about my suddenly questionable virtue…. 
	But he was my Warrior. And therefore I knew I had nothing to worry about from his full, masculine lips or the way that his eyes twinkled as if pushing all limits and boundaries were innately in his nature. 
	His skin started to warm and glow, and when I refocused my attention on his eyes I realized it was because of the way I was staring at him. 
	Objectifying him….
	What was wrong with me?
	I chose to blame the fact that he was an Angel. 
	“Sorry,” I mumbled, feeling my own cheeks heat with embarrassment. “Uh, so it’s not going well down there?” I changed the subject and averted my eyes around the room to find something else to look at…. anything else.
	“There are too many opinions,” he explained, sliding down the door into a sitting position on the floor. He stretched out his long legs in front of him and crossed his ankles. I avoided the way his stomach muscles folded over each other and the attractive color of light emanating from him in soft waves.
	I completely avoided it.
	“They all want what’s best for us,” I decided, feeling something stir inside of me…. something like a war between gratitude and teenage rebellion. “And suddenly they can’t trust anybody else. This is a first for them.”
	“What do you think is best for us?” Seth asked, his amber eyes turning to gold. 
	“I want to stay and fight, to train here and show the Darkness we are ready for this war,” I answered quietly, but with the gravity of every one of my convictions. 
	“That’s what I want too,” Seth agreed confidently. “And that’s what we’ll do.”
	Seth stood up, and reached for the door handle. He would inform the grownups of our decision and then, because I trusted him implicitly and because I instinctively could feel out his decisions, he wouldn’t give them an option to argue. 
	“Seth?” I stopped him before he left. He turned his head and waited patiently as I gathered the courage to ask my next question, “What do you think their plan is? I mean…. the Darkness? What are they trying to do?”
	“Kill us,” he answered simply. 
	I took a moment to swallow and let his words settle over me. 
	“Then only their tactics have changed,” I decided. “But so have ours.” 
	“Exactly,” he smiled at me, a fire lighting his face and destiny electrifying his being. 
	Ultimately it didn’t matter how the Darkness tried to destroy us, our call, our goals…. our fate didn’t change. We were born and bred to fight evil and protect this planet. And that was exactly what we were going to do.
	My phone buzzed next to me on the nightstand and I reached for it as Seth closed the door behind him on his way downstairs. Under normal circumstances and if it was anyone else I would have let voicemail bother with it, but Tristan’s familiar picture stared at me and his number scrolled across the bottom of the screen.
	“Hello?” I forced a strong voice into the receiver and hoped he couldn’t tell something was wrong.
	“Where are you?” he demanded, not sounding happy. “Are you Ok?”
	It was completely quiet where he was, no background noise or music or anything. I decided he was either standing outside Lincoln’s house or he had already hopped inside his truck.
	“I’m fine….” I lied, well, it wasn’t exactly a lie. I would be fine. There wasn’t anything for him to worry about. Although it was the first time I’d ever willingly left Tristan out of the truth. A sick, uneasy feeling churned my stomach but I knew this was necessary. “Things were getting kind of out of control there, I thought it would help if I got out of the way,” I offered, hoping he would leave it at that. 
	“Things did get a little crazy,” he relented, the sound of disappointment clear in his tone. “So you’re at home?” 
	“Yeah, in bed actually….” 
	“Want some company?” his voice turned low and husky and I knew he only meant on the roof outside my room, but that didn’t stop the warm tingle from spreading across my belly.
	“Mmmm… not tonight,” I sighed. “Hey did you see Piper before you left? Was she Ok?” 
	“Yeah, she was Ok,” Tristan laughed, and I decided I did not like his tone.
	“That sounds ominous,” I pried. 
	“It’s not any of my business,” Tristan replied, pretending to be a gentleman but I could hear the amusement lacing every word.
	“You better spill it, Tristan David Shields,” I growled, not in the mood to play games. 
	“It’s not a big deal, it’s just that, well some people make war and some people make love,” he laughed again and I had to stop myself from inviting him over just so I could slap him. 
	“What does that mean?” I screeched. 
	“You better ask Piper,” Tristan sobered, sounding sincere. 
	“Is this about Lincoln?” I demanded, my face flushing with the idea of what she could have been manipulated into doing tonight by the influence of the Shadows. Not that teenagers didn’t come to these kinds of decisions all the time on their own, but Piper would have needed an extra push tonight. Maybe not even Piper…. Lincoln would have needed an extra push! They barely knew each other in that kind of way and Lincoln was way too shy to suggest something like that to Piper on a whim. “Just give it to me in movie ratings.”
	“Definitely PG-13,” Tristan answered back immediately, probably to reassure me more than anything. “It was worse than a Disney tween musical, but they were still on the stairs…. in front of everyone.”
	“In front of everyone?” I groaned, hating the Darkness even more for Piper’s sake. 
	“Uh, yeah….” there was no sugar coating left and Tristan knew that.
	“What about you? Did you get into any extra trouble?” I was afraid of the answer. 
	“Who me?” Tristan barked out a laugh. “You should know me better than that.”
	“Mmm-hmm…” I sighed, and then rubbed my eyes. “I do know you, and that’s exactly why I’m worried!” 
	“Goodnight, Stella,” his voice dropped to that rough timber again and I couldn’t stop the smile that spread across my face. 
	“Goodnight, Tristan,” I replied softly, hanging up the phone and laying my head back against the pillow. Oh that boy….  

----

	Sunlight streamed in through my windows and rested over me in a blanket of comfort and warmth. The daylight energized me, gave me strength again and reminded me that this planet was still surrounded by an entire Army of light. I stretched my arms above my head and felt the pull of too-tight muscles and the still sore scars that painted my back. But I was better, the cold, numbing feeling was gone and the light inside of me pumped with my blood giving me natural warmth and security.
	A knock at my door had me reaching for the covers and pulling them up to my neck. I shifted to a sitting position in bed, and smiled as Seth flung the door open not even waiting for my response. 
	“Hey,” he wore that wide grin I was growing used to. He leaned against the door frame, holding a tray of food in his hands. “So…. I thought you could use some comfort food to finish the healing process.” 
	He walked toward me and a jilt of excitement jumpstarted my heart into an excited frenzy. “Are those chocolate chip pancakes?” I squealed. 
	“Yes, but don’t get too excited,” his smile wavered and I paused at his rare display of insecurity. “They’re not Annabelle’s or anything, but I tried. Although I may have gone overboard with the chocolate chips….”
	Seth set the tray on my lap and I took in the almost black, thin, circles…. circle-ish breakfast items and had to bite back a smile. He had attempted to gussy up the dish by adding fresh strawberries and a glop of whipped cream, but underneath the garnishes were dense, black oblong shapes that kind of gave me the shivers when I thought about actually digesting one of them. 
	“Seth, this looks…. uh, this looks great,” I smiled up at him, still bleary eyed from sleep, my voice raspy and hoarse. 
	He tipped the bottle of syrup my way and his smile grew. I couldn’t disappoint him so I obliged by pouring a copious amount of syrup over Seth’s “creation” and dove in. Seth stood next to my bed, rocking back and forth on his toes, bouncing up and down with barely contained energy.
	“Well, what do you think?” he asked, while I still chewed through my first bite. 
	“Um….” I stalled, swallowing the excessively rich, disturbingly thick bite. “It’s really…. really…. chocolaty!” I finished enthusiastically, trying to make it sound like a compliment. 
	“I know it’s not like Annabelle’s, but I-“ he started fidgeting, and his nervous mannerisms were in such contrast to his perfect face and usual confidence that I couldn’t let him worry about them any longer. 
	“I love them!” I declared, cutting another huge bite off with my fork. “Seriously, Seth, this is exactly what I need to finish recovery. Thank you.” 
	His charming smile became self-assured again and his skin let off that soft glow that told me he believed me. I shoved the overly large, overly sweet bite of pancakes into my mouth and made a moaning sound to solidify my point. 
	I decided on the second bite that I could eat at least half the pile, and make it worth his effort. They weren’t…. bad…. they were just really, really sugary, and dense…. and not very pancake like at all. They were more like edible bites of a cement pastry; but it was possibly the most adorable gesture ever. 
	“So you’re feeling better?” Seth asked, his eyes narrowing into speculative slits. 
	“For the most part, yeah. I mean, I’m a little sore and tight, but I don’t feel like death anymore,” I smiled up at him, cutting another bite and popping it energetically into my mouth.
	“Good….” Seth mumbled, although it didn’t sound like he was all that thrilled. “Because Jupiter wants to train again. I told him you probably weren’t up for it, but he is being pretty stubborn. But if you’re still sore, then it isn’t a good idea and I can tell him he will have to wait another day.” 
	I could feel how concerned Seth was for me in more than his expressive eyes and glowing skin; there was this connection between us, like an invisible cord that tied us together. I could feel his concern, deep in my bones. I could sense his anxiety over my injuries, his fear over pushing me too hard. It was all there, all between us. We were bonded and because of that I knew I had to get out of bed and train. As comfortable as I was with Seth and as flattered by his concern, I knew I had to become a better fighter so that I could erase these emotions for him. He couldn’t do his job of protecting me properly unless I could do my job of not getting killed. 
	Plus training meant I had a legitimate excuse not to finish the entire plate of pancakes. 
	“No, it’s Ok,” I replied confidently. “I need to train, Jupiter’s right. The Darkness isn’t going to stop and so I can’t either. I was sloppy and slow last night, and I can’t ever be that unprepared again. They know by now who I am and what I’m capable of…. or really, what I’m not capable of. Next time they send their spies, I want to send them away terrified.” I smiled up at Seth and pushed forward all of my courage. What I was saying was true, but I wasn’t sure if I believed it was possible yet. 
	“We will,” Seth assured me. “Serena and Nate are going to train too, while they’re still here. It will be a good opportunity for us, since neither of us have really had hand to hand combat with another Angel.”
	“What? Are you saying you don’t count fighting me as real hand to hand combat?” I gasped, pretending to be offended.
	“Not when I go so easy on you,” he gave me an impish grin and moved to the door.
	“That stops today!” I yelled at his retreating figure. 
	“I know,” he called back, but I could still feel his anxiety over me as he made his way down the stairs.	
	I shook my head, and pushed the tray of food off me before climbing slowly out of bed and ambling over to my closet. I was wide awake now, but my body still felt the aftereffects of battle. I stretched nice and long and then picked out some workout clothes that would let me move freely. By the time I had thrown my hair up in a ponytail and made my way downstairs, Serena, Nathaniel, Seth and Jupiter were all waiting for me. 
	“Finally,” Jupiter grumbled. He turned his back on me and walked straight out the back door. He carried two oversized canvas, black bags with him that folded in half, coming together at the handles: the sword bags.  
 	“Good morning,” Serena smiled slowly at me. I had met her briefly last night and was surprised at her other-worldliness then; in the light of morning her sharp, angled features and ethereal complexion were even more staggering. Serena was from a post outside of this galaxy, but was making Earth her home until I turned eighteen. She had long, flowing orange hair and startling blue eyes, the color of the ocean around a coral reef. Her skin, which was clear and porcelain, radiated light without much effort at all and her willowy frame towered over me gracefully. To me, she was clearly an Angel and humanity would hardly know what to make of her should she meet them. As far as blending in went, she was an odd choice, but her skill and experience on the battlefield preceded her. I wondered for a moment why they were handing over Earth to me so soon, when she was clearly capable for the job.
	“Good morning, Serena,” I smiled, pathetically intimidated. “Good morning, Nathaniel.” 
	“Nate, remember?” the Warrior corrected, offering me his hand. Nate was a lot like Seth in looks, with dark, unruly hair and a severely muscular face. But where Seth had shades of mystery and mischief, Nate was all goodness and light. His gray eyes sparkled like granite and his matured frame boasted plenty of scars from the battle field. 
	“Right, good morning, Nate,” I corrected, smiling a little more easily. He wasn’t quite so intimidating, but it wasn’t his shoes I was going to have to fill. 
	We all turned and followed Jupiter out the door, even though he was halfway to our training field by now. We were silent as we trudged through the snow in Jupiter’s wake and I had to wonder if Seth was as daunted as I was. I glanced over at him, but all I got in return was a cocky smile and a playful elbow nudge. 
	Nobody wore coats or even seemed to be effected by the near zero degree temps. By the time we reached Jupiter, he had already spread out the weapons across the field. I almost laughed, realizing he had clearly just picked up the different swords and tossed them randomly as far as he could. He was tossing swords! I cringed to think of any poor woodland creatures that got in his way.
	“We will continue to train with swords and introduce other weapons later, as I see fit. But right now, since Stella is struggling with the basic skill of protecting herself, I think this is our top priority,” Jupiter instructed gruffly.
	I flinched at his frustration with me and then centered myself, remembering why I needed to push myself. Jupiter was right, I had to get better. And he was pushing to make me better.  
	“Let’s start Star against Star, and add more opponents as time progresses,” Jupiter instructed and I realized at some point this morning he expected me to be able to fight all three of them. 
	Gulp.
	“Stella, Serena choose your weapons,” Jupiter waved his arm across the expanse of the field, while Nate and Seth stepped out of the way. 
	Serena flipped through the air and landed twenty feet away, gracefully picking up a long, thin sword before her feet touched the ground. She turned back to me with a glint in her bright blue eyes that I was honestly scared of. And then she raised her sword defensively. She poised her body for the fight like a tigress on the prowl, her long sinewy body stretched and ready.
	Double gulp. 
	Schooling my daunted and very intimidated thoughts, I backed away from her, finding a katana sword to match her nodachi. Her sword was thinner but longer, I was hoping I would have more control with the shorter version of the Japanese style of sword. I raised my katana in a similar pose to Serena, more mimicking her than moving comfortably into position. She looked like more than fighter, more than even a Star, she looked like the goddess of battle. Her orange hair whipped out behind her as if on fire and her eyes shone with the brightness of a sun, even in the daylight. Her body tensed and she waited for me, her muscles flexing in anticipation and her eyes narrowing against me, her opponent. 
She was a Warrior.
	I was a seventeen year old girl that felt awkward holding my heavy weapon.
	I tried to mimic the grace of her stance, but my foot sank lower in the snow than I intended it to and I stumbled a little before recovering. We faced each other from across the field, neither one willing to go on the offensive and give up our defensive position. 
	“Serena, you attack her,” Jupiter commanded when he realized we could wait each other out all day. I saw only a moment’s hesitation before she obeyed.
	Going against every instinct, she crossed the field at a flat out run and leapt through the air, with sword strong above her head. She was not holding back. Not at all…. 
	And for a second I really thought she would kill me. 
	But then my blade was moving before my brain told it to and I responded out of pure instinct to protect myself. I met her sword with a crash that resounded deafeningly, and then I moved swiftly…. gracefully even…. to the side so that I could swing at her again. 
	The clang of swords was loud and piercing against the quiet of the winter morning, but blow after blow I met hers with a force that surprised even me. I shut off the thinking part of my brain, the part that was raised in a human world with human reactions and let the supernatural nature I had repressed for far too long take over. 
	I started to feel like I had the upper hand, if only for a second, but for that tiny moment I was swinging first, doing more than just reacting; I was attacking her. 
	Out of the corner of my eye I could see my inner light encompassing my body, even in bright daylight. Serena and I lit up the field with blinding brightness. Her features blurred the more ingrained in battle we became, but her sword stayed silver and strong, slicing the air and aiming for me. The snow melted at our feet, exposing the dirt and remnants of last year’s crops. 
	She let out a battle cry that sent chills of fear racing over my spine, before flipping into the air to deliver the final blow. At the last second, I leapt backward into a flip of my own and midair…. mid-flip….. I connected with her shoulder pushing her to the ground and landing next to her on one knee with my sword at the base of her throat. 
	I stared at her for a long moment, wondering where I learned to do that and thankful for the way my hand paused. In that moment, I wasn’t training, or fighting a fellow Star, I was defending myself and the force of which I planned to press my sword into my opponent surprised me…. scared me a little. 
	“Good,” Serena whispered in between heavy breaths and then smiled up at me from under my weapon. “That was very good.”
	Still stunned from my win, I backed away slowly, giving her breathing room and removing the threat of my katana from her throat. I stood up, shoulders heaving from exertion and pulled in my light so that I wasn’t a baby version of the sun. Seth stood next to Nate smiling as proudly as he could and I got the distinct impression he was trying very hard not to cheer for me. Nate too was smiling, but more like he was relieved for my sake than anything else. 
	Jupiter, on the other hand, was not smiling. Jupiter eyed me from across the field skeptically, like I had just cheated somehow or Serena had gone easy on me. If she had, I couldn’t tell…. 
	“Again,” Jupiter announced, grinding out his consonants as if it pained him to watch this. “Nate, Seth you attack too. We can never have a repeat of last night.” 
	I swallowed the anxiety that came with three skilled attackers when I felt like I had just given everything I had to win against one. But I picked up my katana and then found its sister half buried in the snow a few feet away, deciding I could at least try to match the number of weapons coming against me. 
	“This will feel more like how the Shadows attack,” Jupiter announced as if for my benefit. But I knew whatever his methods were Jupiter would push me and push me and push me until I was perfection…. until I was the Warrior that could protect the Earth effectively. Or until I broke and it was clear the High Council had either made a mistake or had been tricked into picking me.
	I wiped at my brow with the back of my hand and readied myself to meet my attackers. A chill swept over me as they crossed the field. A strong enough foreboding feeling that I lost focus for a moment and looked around. There was something out there, something hidden in the dense tree line. The distinct feel of evil seeped into my blood and warned me that we were being watched. 
	But as soon as it came, it was gone and I was left in confusion. The other three Angels still advanced against me, not giving anything away. I must have imagined it…. I must have confused my anticipation for this battle with the dread of more Fallen spying on me. 
	As the four of us connected in fight, I let instinct take over again and lead the way; still I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched.
	Or that an evil presence lurked somewhere so unseen they could be invisible to even us.

Chapter Ten

	“Good morning, Piper!” I sang as I sidled up to my locker and noticed she had her cute little brunette head shoved further inside the cold metal shelves than normal.
	She mumbled something incoherent that sounded like a string of curse words and tried to actually crawl inside her locker. I deposited my backpack and winter coat on a hook inside my own locker and then grabbed a handful of her hair and yanked playfully back.
	“Ow!” she squeaked while swiping at my hand. She eventually pulled her head out of hiding and glared at me. 
	“Piper, what happened Friday night?” I leaned my shoulder against my locker and crossed my arms to let her know I meant business.
	“Oh, Stella,” she cooed, reaching out for my hair. “You look so pretty today! I love it when you wear your hair down….”
	“Stop it!” I slapped her hand away and gave her a more poignant glare. “What happened? And why were you trying to crawl inside your locker?” 
“I was planning on just staying in there all day actually…. but fine, if you want to stick your nose where it doesn’t belong….”
“Stop stalling! What happened?” I demanded, lowering my voice so that the surrounding hall full of students wouldn’t tune into our conversation.
Although I was assuming most of them had witnessed whatever she was about to spill.
“Well, first of all, this is all your fault, Stella Day!” her hazel eyes narrowed on me. “Where did you go? Why weren’t you there? How could you have let this happen to me?” 
“Calm down Pi, and just tell me what happened,” I whispered a bit desperately. 
	Piper looked at me for one more second and then gave me a decided nod. She gripped my wrist in her hand, her painted black fingernails digging into my skin and her silver stack of bangles clanking loudly as she pulled me dramatically into the girls’ bathroom. She let go of me abruptly and then walked over to the mirror to primp her straight bangs and make sure we were completely alone.
	“Ugh…. he…. we…. I kind of made out with Lincoln on Friday night,” she confessed in a dejected voice that let me know exactly how ashamed she was. 
	“But you like him right?” I prompted, hoping to take away some of her post-make-out guilt. I silently cursed the Shadows again and vowed to become the best fighter ever just to protect my friends from slightly-tipsy-post-win-public-make-out-sessions.
	“I don’t know….” she grumbled, turning around and leaning against the line of sinks. “I mean, I wasn’t really sure before Friday night exactly how I felt about him or us. And even when he kissed me, I kind of decided that I did like him…. but not enough to grope him in public! I don’t know what is wrong with me! I’m such a mess!” She let her head fall dramatically into her hands and shook out her hair.
	“Wait,” I demanded, taking a step forward and gripping her shoulders. “You groped him? In front of the entire high school?”
	“It’s awful!” she cried out. “I don’t know what came over me! And now he won’t even look at me!”
	“Well, you probably stole his innocence….” I mumbled and then sucked in my lip, realizing I wasn’t helping the situation.
	“I can’t help it, Ok?” she bit back. “These small town boys can’t handle me. I’m too much woman for them!” 
	I burst out in laughter at Piper’s expense. She was usually overly dramatic, but at least this time she had a reason to be. I sobered though when I realized she wasn’t completely to blame that night, but had to carry the guilt of her manipulated actions on her own. I wished for the first time in my entire life that she knew the complete truth about me and I could share what really happened Friday night with her. 
Usually Piper was my reminder of everything good and innocent about humanity, my escape from the weight of my destiny. I had never shared my secret with her and had no intentions of destroying her rose colored glasses of the world any time soon. But today, watching my best friend flush deep crimson from the reminder of the other night, I wanted desperately to tell her that her actions weren’t entirely her fault.
	“Lincoln’s so shy, Piper. I’m sure it doesn’t really have anything to do with you! He’s probably just still trying to figure out what happened,” I offered, trying to console her. I turned my attention to the mirror and huffed at my blonde hair. Star or not, the static cling from winter was doing all kinds of science experiments on my head. 
	“Ok, that’s the thing!” Piper declared as the first bell rang. We gathered our books and headed toward the door. “He knew exactly what was happening while it was…. happening,” she lowered her voice to a whisper on the other side of the bathroom door. “But now it’s like I’m the bad guy!”
	Up ahead, Tristan and Seth stood awkwardly next to each other by my locker. We worked our way through the scattering crowd to get to them. Tristan and Seth were definitely the most gorgeous things in the entire city of Mead, possibly the entire state of Nebraska, even more possibly the complete universe…. but it was hard to take them seriously when they could barely stand the sight of each other and held pissing contests like they were trapped in the third grade. 
	“He’ll come around,” I assured Piper, dropping my voice to meet her pitch. “And if not, you didn’t really like him anyway, right?” 
	“That’s not what I’m worried about,” she pouted.
	I turned to give her my full attention before we reached the boys. “Then what are you worried about?”
	“I just don’t want to be labeled a super slut for one mistake at one party,” she finished, and it was then that I saw the real fear in her eyes. For as little as Piper cared about high school drama and the small town politics that sometimes surrounded us, she really did put pride her in reputation. She had created an image for herself and it was different than everyone else, but it was the image she created, she had control over it.
	“The first person that even thinks you’re a super slut is going to have to deal with me,” I threatened in a growly voice. 
	“Yeah, because you’re scary,” she rolled her eyes, but I saw the light behind them rekindle. Humanity was funny; as long as humans didn’t feel alone they seemed to be able to face anything. 
	Maybe it just wasn’t humanity though. My future had seemed pretty bleak and impossible until Seth showed up. Maybe every kind of species did better working together.
	“Who’s scary?” Tristan asked pulling me into a hug. His arms went around me with decidedly less fervor than usual and I realized it actually felt kind of awkward with other people watching us.
	“Stella,” Piper replied, nudging me in the arm with her elbow after I stepped away from Tristan. “She’s my muscle.” 
	“You’re muscle?” Seth questioned, leaning toward Piper attentively.	
	“Yeah, you know, like if I need to beat someone up? I’ll just send Stella to take care of them,” Piper replied very seriously. 
	Seth stayed silent, taking in Piper’s comment. I could tell he was trying to decide if she was serious or not and at the same time figure out how much I had told her.
	“Yeah, because Stella really looks like she’s muscle material,” Tristan laughed, rolled his eyes and covered for the uncomfortable silence that had fallen from Seth. “She has the scrawniest arms I’ve ever seen.”
	“Shut up!” I squealed and then punched Tristan in the arm for good measure. 
	The second bell rang and we were all officially late for class. Piper and Seth turned toward around and fell into easy conversation, while Tristan and I followed behind them. I looked over at Tristan ready to say hello properly when I noticed the faint shades of blue and black under his right eye. 
	“What is that?” I demanded, reaching up to press on it. I should have brushed at it nicely, played the attentive and concerned friend, but something about the evidence of Tristan in an actual altercation made me really angry and even angrier when I realized he kept it from me. So I pushed on it kind of hard.
	“Ow!” He laughed, pushing my hand away. “What was that for?” 
	“You should have told me you got into a fight!” I accused him, stopping short of the door to government even though we were already late. 
	“And you should have told me you left the party early to go to one of your fights or whatever they’re called,” he accused right back, his crystalline green eyes narrowing angrily at me.
	“What?” I asked surprised, dropping my voice again. “How did you know?” 
	“This, right here,” he lifted my hair back and ran his finger down the side of my neck slowly. “You didn’t have that before you left Friday night.”
	“Stella, Tristan,” Mrs. Trinker called from inside the classroom. “You can finish your conversation later or in detention, you choose!” 
	Tristan traced the faint scar with his thumb, staring at me for a moment more. I knew he wasn’t happy with me for keeping the truth from him, but all I could do right now was concentrate on not  concentrating on his thumb on my neck. Mrs. Trinker cleared her throat impatiently from inside the classroom and I broke away from the trance of his gaze. 
	I cleared my throat and focused on Government, which was really difficult. But if I had any chance of making it through today I needed to push any thoughts of the Darkness far away and forbidden thoughts of Tristan’s fingers on my skin even farther away….

----

	Lunch was awkward. Like really, really awkward…. 
	“So Rigley, excited for your college visit this weekend?” I asked casually, hoping to break some of the tension. 	
	Rigley had been more quiet than usual because he felt bad about Lincoln’s house getting nearly destroyed Friday night. Lincoln, who was usually quiet, hadn’t said a word to anybody because he was mad at Rigley and because of the tension between him and Piper. Piper was completely absent from lunch today. Tristan was taking turns glaring at me over his ham sandwich and talking to Bree, which I found completely annoying so I was returning his glares with ones of my own. And Seth sat next to me, taking in all the drama like he had front row tickets to a Jerry Springer show. 
	“Uh, yeah, sure,” Rigley answered, pushing his bag of chips around the table idly. “I’m not really sure what the point of it is, but my parents want me to go, so….” he shrugged his shoulders as if he could care less.
	“Why don’t you want to go?” Seth asked.
	“Well, it’s just that I know where I want to go already, but they want me to ‘explore every option,’” Rigley explained, using his fingers for air quotes. 
	“And where do you want to go?” Seth pressed.
	“UNL obviously, but they want me to see if I can get an athletic scholarship at a smaller school,” Rigley shrugged his shoulders again and went back to his chips. 
	“You can’t get an athletic scholarship to UNL?” Seth asked. I smiled at the way the University of Nebraska at Lincoln’s abbreviation came unnaturally off his lips, when everyone else in the room had been dreaming about that school since infancy.
	Rigley answered Seth with a short laugh and an enthusiastic shake of his head, “Yeah right, I’m no Tristan Shields.”
	“Shut it,” Tristan threatened. 
	“UNL is a huge university,” I explained gently to Seth. “They have a very competitive athletic program, especially in football.” 
	“So you either have to be really good,” Rigley continued, “Or have older brothers that can sweet talk you a spot onto the team.” 
	“And which one are you?” Seth asked Tristan honestly, although the air around our table suddenly became thick with tension.
	“A little of both,” Tristan half-growled. I was the only one to notice the way the tips of his cheekbones reddened with embarrassment at the mention of his future career and the way his torso shifted uncomfortably. Tristan hated being compared to his older brothers, and hated it even more when people insinuated that they were the only reason he could play for the Huskers.  
	“So what do you think you’ll do?” I asked Rigley, hoping to defer the coming storm. “Your choice or your parents’ choice?”
	“They’re the ones footing the bill,” Rigley answered, lifting his shoulders as if he didn’t have a choice. “But I’m hoping they see how badly I want UNL and give up their dream of a college athlete for a son.” 
	“It must be nice to have parents so invested in your future,” Seth offered. 
	I turned to look at him, having never heard that tone of voice before. He stared at Rigley seriously, as if he were contributing the best kind of truth and something twitched inside my heart, something I hadn’t thought of in a very long time. 
	“Why? Your parents don’t care where you go to school?” Rigley asked, laughing a little to defuse the heaviness of the moment.
	“My parents are dead,” Seth replied casually, doing a shoulder shrug of his own. The glow from inside him was completely silent as he looked back down at his school lunch. His eyes were a soft shade of honey, but nothing extraordinary shone from them, no sign that he was a different species or called to something great. 
	I reached out instinctively and gripped his arm, wishing he had confided in me earlier. I heard Rigley offer something like, “That sucks…” but it was all I could do not to openly weep at the table. I knew his parents were dead, but we had never talked about them. I wanted to kick myself for how callous and self-absorbed I had been. Just because every moment of our free time was dedicated to training, didn’t mean I shouldn’t try to learn something personal about Seth. Ugh, he must think I’m completely vain. I didn’t even know how his parents died!
	But then that pang in my chest reminded me of a memory of my childhood…. My parents weeping over lost friends, a mission gone wrong…. another traitor. 
	“Yeah, but it was a long time ago,” Seth recovered; doing the casual-male-shoulder-shrug again that seemed to dictate ninety percent of male conversation. I was still reeling though, hating myself for not knowing this before, for not taking the time to get to know Seth better. He was my intended, and already my Counterpart and I had kept things coolly distant between us.
	“It’s alright, Stella,” he whispered, leaning into me and offering me that charming smile that melted every female in a fifty yard radius. His glow was back and there was light behind his eyes again so I loosened my grip on his bicep. “It really was a long time ago.”
	“I just…. I don’t know what happened,” I mumbled weakly, my eyes brimming with tears. 
	“Because I didn’t tell you,” he reminded me. “We’ll talk later.” He let his forehead lean against mine and for a brief moment there was only the two of us in the entire world. I inhaled deeply, breathing him in and letting his clean, fresh snow scent wash over me. 
	“Ok,” I agreed. I pulled back a little to stare up into his liquid amber eyes. He was an Angel, perfect, good, full of light…. But there was more to Seth, more to him than any other Angel I had ever met. Shades of mystery and trouble, something different and unnatural for Angels, pulled me into him. Maybe the answers were in his story, in whatever happened in his past. 
	The bell rang and we all got up to empty our trays or throw away our trash. Not at all excited about my Anatomy class; I took my time separating the items off my tray. 
	“Hey, take a walk with me?” Tristan asked softly from behind me. 
	I turned around and knew before I even looked into those forest green eyes there was no way I would ever say no to him. “I’ll be late for Anatomy,” I tried weakly.
	“I have a pass from Coach, I’ll just add your name to it,” he lifted his eyebrows waiting for my eventual cave. 
	“Where are we going?” I asked without much hesitation at all.
	“I just have to run down to the equipment storage room and grab some of the old practice jerseys. Coach sent the ones we usually use to be mended, so we have to wear moldy, shredded ones until we get the other ones back,” he explained as we left the crowd of exiting students and headed toward the stairs to the basement. 
	“Mmm… important mission,” I noted dryly. “Obviously Coach Donovan is very concerned about your academic career.” 
	Tristan laughed, a deep throaty sound that made me smile. “Yeah, I don’t know why he’s having me do this right now for him.”
	“Well, I’m glad he is,” I confessed. “Anatomy might be the most boring class in the history of school.” I groaned as we made our way down the dark, creepy steps that led to the equipment storage rooms, locker rooms and boiler room. The locker rooms were on the outer sides of the basement, close to the stairs and accessible from the gym, the interior of the school and the outside doors that led to the football fields, but once you passed the locker room doors the basement of the high school became a maze of hallways and rusted metal doors, dimly lit and a perfect set for a B-rated horror movie. 
	“I’m glad he is too,” Tristan murmured, turning on the hallway light at the bottom of the stairs. The long florescent lights sputtered to life but didn’t let off anything much more than a dim, stuttering flicker. 
	“Ugh, I hate it down here,” I admitted, leaning closer to Tristan.
	“You’re not scared, are you?” Tristan teased, pinching my side. I jumped from his hand, but then he reached his arm around my back to reassure me and I leaned in closer, craving the comfort of his closeness. 
	“Tristan, my job is to protect this planet from everything scary, of course I’m not scared,” I scolded him, but my voice came out breathy and unsure. Ugh, basements gave me the creeps.
	“Are you ever going to tell me what happened Friday night?” Tristan paused at the door to the equipment room, playing with the keys in his hand. I leaned against the wall to wait for him, but he leaned in with me and suddenly we were standing very close together.
	“Are you ever going to tell me what happened Friday night?” I turned the question on him, brushing my fingers gently under his bruised eye. 
	“No,” he whispered leaning in closer.
	I didn’t know what changed between us, whether it was Seth’s arrival or the threat of me leaving him, but Tristan had changed. He seemed more determined about our relationship…. more protective.
	Yes, he definitely seemed more protective of me, but it was more than that. He seemed- hungry.
	As I looked up into his half-lidded eyes, his long dark lashes giving him a sexy quality I usually tried to ignore, I saw how starved he was now. How ravenous he was for me. 
	“I don’t like this, Stella,” he confessed seriously, his deep baritone voice dropping to a husky tone that sent shivers all over my skin. “I don’t like that you’re a part of something I can’t be, that you’re out there, risking your life and fighting bad guys and there’s nothing I can do about it. I want to protect you. I want to be the one fighting with you.” His gaze had frozen me, speared me against the wall and one of his hands had somehow landed on the curve of my hip, burning through my thin sweater with the heat of his body and weight of his words.
	“You can’t protect me,” I reminded him in a raspy voice that I had desperately wanted to sound authoritative. “I have to do this. It’s the only reason I’m here.” 
	“I know that….” He ran his free hand over his shaved head and looked down the hall for a moment. “And it’s killing me,” he sighed, his voice breaking in the softest, most desperate way. His free hand came to rest aggressively next to me on the metal door, making it echo down the hallway. I jumped at the sound, inching us closer together. 
	“Tristan….” I breathed, wanting to say a million things, remind him of a million different reasons we had never crossed the invisible line between friendship and more, but my lips stopped working at his name.
	“That’s not all that’s killing me,” he sighed, closing the last few inches between us. My body pressed against the wall again as his lean, muscular frame rested against me. His right hand gripped my waist, pulling me into him and his left hand moved slowly to the nape of my neck, tipping my head toward him, towards his lips.
	I was helpless to stop him. There was a voice screaming inside of me that this was wrong, that Tristan and I could never be anything more than friends and we should never even entertain the idea. We had gone our whole lives without crossing this line, and now was definitely not the right time to start blurring boundaries. If we did this, there was no going back…. and that terrified me.
	Still, there was another voice not nearly as panicked, but just as solidly confident, an old voice, one that had lived there for as long as I could remember that urged me forward, whispered to me how long I’ve wanted to press my lips against Tristan’s and feel how soft they are, how I’ve wanted to be held in his arms as more than a friend, but as something he cherished…. even longed for.
	Something he desired.
	Tristan’s gaze fell to my lips, and his eyes turned starved. His tongue swept over his bottom lip as he prepared himself for something I wasn’t yet ready to admit to myself was actually happening. A shudder, hot and trembling, worked its way over me. I gave up the weak battle I had been waging and leaned into him, ignoring whatever reason was left.
	He hovered above me for a seemingly infinite amount of time, caught in indecision. The air crackled around us, ignited with sparks of a deeply buried desire and the whispered reminders that what we both wanted, what we both were desperate for, was absolutely forbidden. What would happen next would change our relationship; there would be no going back, no pretending that nothing happened. But it would also change us…. completely.
	To kiss Tristan meant going against everything I had been born to achieve. It meant going against my parents, and the High Council and…. Seth. Still, the guilt and reasoning that had held me back before weren’t strong enough to affect my will now as I lifted my hands against his chest, feeling the frantic beating of his heart underneath his thin t-shirt. In that moment, I was more than willing to pay the consequences; I was willing to risk everything to taste Tristan’s lips against mine just once.
	I probably should have been scared of how strongly my feelings seemed to suddenly burst forward for him. 
	But instead of fear, something much more like clarity settled over me. 
	And then something moved to my right, something in the shadows of the basement. I told myself to ignore it, to deal with it later. This was more important than anything else. 
	“What was that?” Tristan jumped, suddenly startled. He looked to the corner I had suspected the Shadow to be lurking and stepped back a few feet. 
	I peered into the darkness with him, trying to get my bearings again. My head was spinning from what almost happened between us. I trembled from the excitement of the moment and left over fear from what could have been a very stupid decision. Had we really almost kissed?
	My breathing was coming out in short, ragged breaths and I forced my vision to focus on the illusive Shadow. 
	“Um, you saw that?” I asked in a small voice I hardly recognized.
	“What was it Stella?” Tristan asked in a low growl. I noticed for the first time that he was breathing hard too and although he had put quite a distance between us, he seemed as disoriented as I was.
	“A Shadow,” I explained, not able to find a reason to tell him anything but the truth. “It’s part of the Darkness, like the infantry part.” 
	“That’s what it is though, right? It’s an actual shadow?” he asked, finally gaining some lucidity.
	“Yeah, kind of.” 
	“I’ve seen them before,” he admitted, turning to look at me for the first time since he almost kissed me. The fire was gone from his eyes, but they still held me with all of the concern and adoration he was capable of. “On Friday night, they were at the party. And…. and I’ve seen them other places too.” 
	“You shouldn’t be able to see them. Humans can see them sometimes, but not usually,” I explained but my argument sounded weak. I trusted Tristan, if he had seen them before than I believed him.
	“What does that mean?” Tristan asked, half laughing as if I was accusing him of not being human.
	“I don’t know,” I answered truthfully. “I’ll ask my weapons trainer about it. But in the meantime, let’s get these jerseys and get out of here.” I shivered from the dank cold this time, and Tristan nodded his head in agreement.
	He put the correct key into the old lock and paused before opening the door, “Hey, listen, about what just happened…. or what almost happened, I-“
	“Hey, don’t worry about it,” I shook my head as if it were no big deal, although I could still see the after effects of glow on my skin. “Let’s just chalk it up to the romantic atmosphere down here and move on, Ok?”
	Tristan laughed at that, but shook his head like it was the best idea I’d ever had, “Yeah, Ok. I forgot how the smell of mold and sewage gets you all feisty.”
	“Don’t forget the possibility of dead rodents,” I continued the joke, although I didn’t feel any of the humor. “A girl hardly knows what to do with herself with an ambiance like this,” I smiled and batted my eye lashes coyly, continuing to ease the tension between us. 
	But something had shaken up inside of me that I was having trouble piecing back together. Disappointment rang out inside my head and an ache so fierce my mouth had gone dry and my internal organs actually hurt from frustration. 
	I needed to distance myself from Tristan. I needed to put this all out of my head and go back to the way things used to be between him and me, or how they should be with the addition of Seth. 
	Oh boy.

Chapter Eleven

	“Do you have everything packed up?” I asked Seth over the sudsy water we were washing dishes in. He and Jupiter were moving to their rental tonight, so my parents had hosted a farewell dinner for them even though we would still see them on a daily basis. 
	“Yeah, I think so,” he replied as he dried the last plate and set it on a stack of other identical ones. 
	“Need help carrying anything out?” I motioned toward the pile of suitcases by the kitchen door waiting to be loaded into Jupiter’s recently purchased Chevy pickup truck. The truck was a new model, but nothing too flashy or attention seeking. My father suggested to Jupiter that the best way to fit in around here was to have a moderately priced truck; it was the sad, but honest truth. 
	“Sure,” Seth shrugged and we left the drying dishes to load up their few belongings. 
	“So will you guys have to buy like beds and stuff or are you moving that here?” I asked, tossing a duffle bag over the side rail of the red truck. 
	“No, the house comes fully furnished, which is why I think Jupiter is so excited to get it,” Seth explained leaning back against the bumper.
	“Oh, so that’s what Jupiter looks like when he gets excited,” I mused sarcastically. 
	“Just wait till Christmas,” Seth laughed, waggling his eyebrows at me. 
	The night air was frozen at the end of January, but neither Seth nor I let the cold or snow bother us. A healthy glow of light lit up the white, powdered ground around us as we relaxed against the truck and looked up at our fellow fighters defending the Earth from the expanse of space. 
	“Can I ask you something?” I ventured, leaning further back against the truck and tipping my head up so I could have a better view of the clear night sky. 
	“Stella, you can ask me anything,” Seth answered quietly.
	He knew where this conversation was headed and I was glad. I had been avoiding the conversation for more than a week, trying to build up the courage to pry into his life where he hadn’t invited me. 
	“What happened to your parents?” My voice was soft, and fragile as if the memory of his past would wound me as much as it had him.
	Seth was silent for a long time, gazing skyward and his inner light flickering like a light bulb about to burn out. I had just decided to tell him to forget it, when he breathed a long sigh and opened his mouth.
	“I was nine,” he began and the pain that laced each syllable felt like a knife wound in my own heart. “My parents were stationed here, just like yours, only we were on the other side of the world…. literally. I spent most of my childhood on the southern tip of Sri Lanka, in a small coastal town called Galle. My parents worked with a humanitarian group there as their cover, working with the Sri Lankan government to stabilize a small faction of antigovernment rebels. We lived near the ocean, the most beautiful beach you will ever see. The sand is as golden as our skin, and the water is perfect, clean and blue and warm. Occasionally my parents were called away for missions, but because they had two children, their off-planet duties were less demanding than your parents.”
	“Two children?” I gasped, completely absorbed with every one of his words. 
	“I have an older sister,” Seth answered. “Or…. had an older sister.”
	“What….” I trailed off, not sure if I wanted to hear the story after all.
	“Because their time off-planet grew less and less, our contacts with the High Council also became lessened. Our position on Earth was already dangerous, as you know and so my parents trusted very few Stars. One of my father’s oldest friends however, used to visit often. Aliah. He was family, and he and my father served together before my parents were given this position. He was like this goofy uncle that would spoil Seven and me. That’s my sister’s name, Seven. He would take us to the beach, and buy us fresh pineapple. He was always around it seemed, at least in my nine year old mind. And he made my parents laugh. We had some of the best times as a family when he was there. Anyway, the Darkness came for us, and we had to run. My father was tipped off by Sidra who was on her way to stop them. At the time we weren’t sure how they found us, but it didn’t matter because we had to just leave everything behind and go. We got out of Sri Lanka safely and made it as far as Hong Kong. My parents had been given strict evacuation orders in case something like that was to happen, and we followed the plan to the last detail. But…. he was waiting for us. Aliah was waiting, with an army of Fallen. My parents…. at first didn’t know what to make of him, standing there, surrounded by their enemies…. It seemed like hours passed before they picked up their swords to fight him. But they fought hard, they fought better than any Star I’ve ever witnessed or heard of. In the end though, there were just too many Fallen…. Before their death, they were given the opportunity to join the Darkness, to join Aliah. He stood over them, while they faced him from their knees, swords to their throats…. bloody…. beaten…. He asked them to join him on the other side. And when they didn’t, Aliah killed them both. He didn’t even hesitate…. It was like he didn’t even remember my father as his friend. He just…. he just slit their throats and let them fall to the ground like trash. My sister….” his voice broke at the mention of her and I grabbed his hand with every ounce of compassion I had in me and held it tightly against my chest. “My sister, after my parents were dead, their bodies lying face down in their own blood, walked across the distance, careful not to get blood on her shoes and stood by our enemies. She joined them…. she chose Aliah. She didn’t cry, or even look at my parents, she just made sure not to get any blood on her shoes….  Seven is older than me and it was like I was watching my wise, sweet sister make this very adult decision; she was only fifteen at the time, but I was so much younger than her. I trusted her.” 
	“What did you do?” I gasped, tears falling freely from my burning eyes.
	“I didn’t do anything….” Seth admitted as if he had failed his parents at the age of nine, as if he could have done anything. “I watched my parents die, and then I watched as my sister betrayed not only our family, but everything we stand for. And I knew it was all because of me, all because of what I was supposed to do for Earth. But before I could even pick up my father’s sword to at least die honorably, Jupiter was there. He can fly; I know you saw him the first night. Earth’s gravity affects him differently than humans. And neither Fallen nor Angels can sense him because he isn’t a spiritual being. Anyway, he was there all of a sudden, in front of me, shouting curses at them all for what they did to my parents and then in another second he had picked me up and taken off with me. We flew forever it seemed, it doesn’t take him longer than it does us, but I think he wanted to make sure we lost them all before he chose a place to land. We arrived in Boston, close to sunrise and when we landed he told me that the High Council had put him in charge of me now, that he would raise me and that was that. I trusted him because I had nothing left to trust and because he stood up for my parents. Everyone I knew had betrayed them and he cursed them for their actions, he cursed Aliah and he cursed my sister. Jupiter was more upset over their deaths than my own sister. And Jupiter has been my guardian ever since.”
	“And your sister? Have you seen her since?” I asked, although even asking the question was painful for me, so I could hardly comprehend how awful it would be for Seth.
	“No, I haven’t seen her,” was all he said and then he stood up and tipped his head all the way back to look straight up into the sky. His hands linked together and supported his neck and I felt the intensity of his gaze all the way to my bones, as if he were challenging the sky to tell a different story.
	I couldn’t take it anymore, the pain…. the heartbreak. It was too much, too devastating. I stood up and moved with supernatural speed to him. I collided against his chest with a force I would have gladly doubled and wrapped my arms around his waist, holding him to me as if I could take away the pain of those horrible memories. 
	Slowly his strong arms came around me and hugged me back. His body didn’t tremble with tears and his sadness didn’t affect him like I thought it would…. like I expected it to. It was like I felt him harden next to me, his horrible memories turning into a drive so fierce and determined I thought he would burst into a supernova in the next breath. 
	“It was a long time ago,” Seth whispered as if he were comforting me instead of the other way around. “I’ve grown up since then, Stella. Next time I won’t sit there and watch. Next time I’ll do something.” 
	“Next time I’ll help you do something,” I promised, lifting my chin to give him my most honest expression. 
	He looked back at me, wiping away a tear with his thumb. “I know you will be.” And then he leaned down and pressed his lips to my forehead. I leaned into him, his warmth, his security, his essence and stayed there until we heard our parents and Jupiter exiting the house. 
	We said our goodbyes and I watched them drive away while standing next to my parents…. my parents who hadn’t been murdered or betrayed. I wondered about Aliah and how he could have betrayed his closest friends like that or how Seven could have walked away from her little brother for an evil that murdered her parents in front of her. 
	I knew the Darkness was more than evil though. The threat to Earth was more than an ominous force that ate at the light and goodness of everything innocent. It was also alluring and mystical and it drew people inside of it so that by the time they could tell the difference between light and dark again they no longer cared about the light but craved the Darkness like the worst kind of drug.
	Seth’s mystery made sense now, the shadows of lesser light I had been keenly aware of and strangely attracted to ever since I saw him. He had experienced the Darkness, experienced pure evil and maybe even been tempted to follow his sister. As a nine year old boy, orphaned before his eyes, before Jupiter showed up to save him, what hope had he held of walking away?
	I shuddered at the thought of losing him even before I knew him. How clever of the Darkness to turn Heaven’s plan against them, to turn their Warrior into a vessel of evil. But they had failed. And they would continue to fail as long as Seth and I stood together. 
	My mom put an arm around my shoulder, shaking me from my thoughts and I realized Jupiter and Seth had been gone for a while and still my parents stood with me outside. 
	“Sorry,” I mumbled, forcing my mind to face reality.
	“Is everything alright, Stella?” my mom asked, her Warrior eyes scrutinizing me. 
	“No,” I answered honestly, because I wasn’t capable of answering any other way. “Seth…. Seth told me what happened to his parents tonight, how they died.”
	After a short pause she suggested, “Let’s go inside.” She ushered me through the kitchen door. She kept her arms around me the entire time, as if she felt the loss as intensely as I did, or Seth did, as if she was afraid of losing me, like I was now afraid of losing her.
	“We wanted Seth to be the one to tell you,” my father explained once we were all seated at the kitchen table. “You were so young when it happened; we thought it was best he shared it with you when you finally met.”
	“I’m glad you let him tell me,” I assured them. It was better that it came from Seth, that he felt like he could trust me enough to open up to me and that I didn’t start our relationship with unnecessary stigmas of him. 
	“What happened with Ethan and Sitara was horrifying,” my mother began and my father instinctively reached out a hand to comfort her as if they had been in danger of the same fate.
	“Seth was young, but old enough to remember everything, am I right?” my father asked and I nodded my head. I realized then how carefully planned out Aliah’s betrayal must have been. Without Jupiter to protect Seth he would have been the perfect age to abduct, old enough to make a conscience decision like his sister did, but young enough not to know better. In humanity there is an age of innocence that absolves the very young of sin after death, I realized for the first time in my life that the age of innocence applied to us as well. 
	“Yes, he remembers everything,” I answered in a barely audible voice. “And his sister?” 
	“Seven is still among them,” my mother answered, her eyes filling with tears. “We don’t know what happened really…. Seth was too young to offer much information, and Seven chose the Darkness. Aliah is believed to be the traitor, but whether Seven had a hand in it or not, we might never know. And maybe it’s better that way.”
	“But how could she? How could she betray her parents…. her little brother?” I demanded, hot tears threatening to spill once again.
	“We don’t know,” my father answered. “Except that the Darkness is very alluring, she could have been manipulated into thinking a million different things. Or…. some of us are more bent toward evil than others. Just like you’ve seen in humanity, sometimes there isn’t much of a push needed at all for a person to choose darkness over light. We are all different, all created for different purposes. Seven believed the lie that her fate was held by the Darkness.” 
	“Has anyone seen her since?” I gasped, wiping at a lone tear that had slipped out of the corner of my eye.
	“Jupiter,” even my father’s voice shook with the pain of those circumstances. “A few years after the incident, he found her outside their apartment one night, watching Seth. He approached her, thinking she might have changed her mind and needed a place to stay, but she fought him instead. They both walked away, it wasn’t much of a skirmish; she was trying to get away from him more than anything. Jupiter thinks she just wanted to check on Seth though. If she had come to take him or hurt him, she would have brought others. She was alone and never returned after that.” 
	I shivered violently, thinking about the depraved fallen Star, watching her unsuspecting brother. How creepy…. like something out of a horror movie. 
	“Seth has been through a lot, Stella,” my father continued, and the truth of his words rang clearly in the otherwise quiet house. “He trusts you though, he let you in. I think that says a lot about his character and what he’s willing to risk for this future you two have together.” 
	“But she’s still out there?” I asked, swallowing the lump rising in my throat. “I mean…. somewhere, on this planet, his sister is out there?” 
	“Yes,” my mother replied solemnly. 
	“And this…. Aliah guy…. what do you know about him?” I sucked in my bottom lip, chewing distractedly until I tasted blood. 
	“He was a good Warrior,” my mother continued. “I fought with him before I met your father, years ago. There were no signs of Darkness, nothing in his behavior or conduct that would have given the High Council any reason to suspect him. He fought with the best. He and Ethan were very good together in the field, and when Ethan was stationed on planet, Aliah requested a closer position so that they could still work together. When or how Aliah defected is unclear, as were his intentions with Sitara and Ethan. We don’t know if he always planned to kill them or because there was a struggle he saw no other option.” 
	“Do you think Aliah thought Seth’s parents would turn too? Or do you think he was after Seth the entire time?” I pressed, needing answers that I knew they couldn’t give me.
	“Your guess is as good as ours, honey,” my mother pulled me closer, into her so that my head rested on her shoulder. 
	“I just can’t imagine what he went through,” I sighed, relishing in the closeness of both of my parents.
	“Thank God for that,” my father muttered, a hard line appearing on his forehead. 
	I stood up slowly, suddenly feeling utterly exhausted. I said goodnight to my parents and made my way up to bed. But even with heavy eyelids and a tired soul, sleep didn’t find me for a long time. 
	When it finally did come, I was back at Lincoln’s farm, fighting my first battle with the Shadows. They surrounded me in the dream world, thicker than smoke and more deadly than ever. I fought hard, wielding my two katanas and keeping my enemies expertly at bay.
	Seth wasn’t there though, he wasn’t fighting with me or lighting up the field with his inner sun. I looked for him desperately, needing help, but more worried about him than anything. 
	A gurgled moan drew my attention to the tree line where a dim light lay awkwardly across the frozen field. I fought to get to it, to find out what it was and when I finally drew close I saw the broken form of Seth laying lifelessly in a pool of his own blood, his light extinguishing with every passing second. 
	She cackled then, her evil, taunting laugh ringing like demonic bells in the night sky. My head snapped up to find a beautiful young woman, with flowing, golden brown hair that curled in soft waves all around her. Her clear, luminous skin lit up the dark sky around her as if she had never turned her back on the light and almond-shaped, honey colored eyes stared at me with a mixture of pure, unadulterated hate and sinister evil. 
She moved lithely across the snow, her face still a haunting image of dark amusement until she stood over her brother, her pointed heel at his throat. She looked down at him with pity for only a second before sweeping down to him, pressing her mouth close to his ear. She whispered something I couldn’t understand, even in the realm of my own dream world and then lifted a dagger the size of her palm, its silver blade glinting in the moonlight. 
I stood paralyzed watching, frozen by the horror of the moment. Before a scream could even rise in my throat she had sliced the dagger across Seth’s perfect neck, the crimson blood pouring savagely from his body. 
I fell to my knees in agony, knowing our greatest Warrior had fallen at the hands of his sister, his own flesh and blood. And when I reached out to touch his body he turned to black, sulfuric smoke, rising up from the blood-stained snow and drifting back to the army of Shadows waiting for me. 
I looked up at Seven, her amber colored eyes mirror images of her brother. A menacing smile twisted her lips and she raised her dagger slowly. I reached for the katana I had dropped next to me, but in its place was a Shadow instead. It sliced at my hand, ripping open my palm and sending dangerously cold shooting pain through every one of my veins. 
Suddenly the Shadows were descending on me from every direction, obscuring my vision and tearing open my flesh. In the seconds it took for me to register the loss of my weapon, she had already walked through the wall of evil with the cool, calm, collectedness of a woman completely at ease with her surroundings. She was older than me by several years, but something in her mannerisms, in her giddy excitement with the depravity surrounding us made her seem young…. made her seem deranged. She cocked her head to one side, looking me over with a waning boredom before lifting the same dagger that killed Seth high above her head and plunging it straight into my heart. Before I felt the pain of her knife blade, I registered the sheer joy she took from destroying something. And then the agonizing pain of death swept over me, pulling me into a blackness so deep I knew there was no recovery. 
I awoke, panting and shaking, gripping at the covers around me. My long hair was plastered to my face in a sheen of sweat and I swallowed against the images that felt like awful, traumatizing reality. 
It was a dream. 
Only a dream.
But two things were clear to me. Seven was after her brother’s life. And without Seth, I would fall.

Chapter Twelve

	“Are you ready for this?” Seth shouted over the rush of air pounding past my ears. 
	I looked down at the obscure Earth flashing miles beneath my feet and then looked back at him. I nodded once, confidently; then I reached for the two katana swords strapped to my back and whipped them out as we slowed down midair, still hidden by cloud cover. 
	I could hear the sounds of battle and the movement of Serena and Nate illuminated by the soft glow of their inner lights even through the hazy fog of clouds. The strong smell of sulfur, like death and rotten eggs, drifted upward and filled my nostrils even this far above the carnage below. 
	Serena called us into help tonight and so Seth and I had showed up to offer backup. And she actually called us, with a cell phone. Phone communications had been previously deemed as unnecessary risks, but with the shortage in our natural communication skill we broke protocol to ensure we could communicate with each other. I called it the “Bat Phone” but nobody else seemed to get the joke. Nate and Serena were new to Earth and Seth had been raised in apparent neglect and without Nick at Night. Regardless, Jupiter kept the high-tech phone with him at all times, in case Serena and Nate needed our help or vice versa. 
Seth gave me a wicked smile and then swooped toward the barren ground beneath us, his favorite cutlass, pirate swords flailing. We were meeting the temporary Protector and her Warrior somewhere over the remote villages of East Africa, currently in the process of taking on a horde of Shadows. We hadn’t even made it to solid ground before the angry demons swept up to meet us, their dark figures concealing Serena and Nate and the light the Angels fought with while we engaged in battle. 
My swords glided gracefully around my body as I let my instincts take over, even hovering midair, my skin heated with the healthy glow that would burn my attackers. I was so much more prepared this time around, my movements felt natural, strong and confident. A few Shadows snuck up on me, especially the back of my thighs and calves, which seemed to be areas of my body that were harder to protect, but I was fighting back, becoming a force to be reckoned with. 
I fought through the Shadows that came against me in the air until my feet were firmly planted on the dry African soil. Being on the ground gave me a clearer view of how Seth, Serena and Nate were doing, which was well except for the sheer number of Shadows. 
Serena had the power to light up as bright as any Star in the sky and banish them all away, but there were after-effects to becoming a miniature version of the sun in the middle of a planet and it was safest for humanity if we fought and killed them the old fashioned way. Besides, it was always better to kill something outright than let it hide away in the darkest places of space, festering in evil, until it found another opportunity to attack. Not that our light couldn’t kill them either but it was like our version of a nuclear attack, both sides understood we were capable of it, but because our side respected and loved not only the planet but its inhabitants there was no way we would ever use our light on planet so drastically. 
I sunk my blade into the chest of another Shadow and turned my head for a millisecond to avoid the black, acidic spray of sticky blood that splashed crudely. I removed my sword to sink it into another one. I glanced up at Seth, never once stopping the movement of my arms as Shadows surrounded me from every direction. He illuminated the darkness around him, making his light pierce through the thick wall of Shadows I was fighting. He lit up his enemies as his body worked and fought against evil. His strong biceps flexed with each sword thrust and met his mark expertly every time. His brow furrowed in concentration and his lips pressed together both as a sign of focus and because nobody wanted to accidentally get Shadow blood in their mouth. It was awful…. and tasted worse.
Feeling my eyes on him, he looked up at me, arms still swinging, swords still finding their marks and smiled his wide grin. His eyes twinkled with success and his skin heated even more, brightening the glow around him and sending Shadows shrieking from exposure. 
“Looking good over there, Stel,” He called, turning his head just a fraction to avoid the blood spray from his latest victim. 
	“Thanks,” I called back, plunging my katana into the center of a Shadow, its long wispy body a mere manipulation from the crack of bones and sickening gush of blood I heard when I removed my weapon. “You too!” I offered, thinking sinful thoughts that had more to do with exactly how good he looked than how many Shadows littered the ground around his feet. 
	“So this…. uh,” Seth started and then paused to turn swiftly in a kicking full circle, taking several Shadows with him, their painful shrieks sounding loudly in the otherwise silent African plain. “Uh, this Valentine’s dance, is it a big deal?” 
	I smiled, despite the last spray of icky, black goo that somehow managed to land in my hair. I resisted the urge to run my hand over it and sunk my sword deeper into the culprit with extra-splashy blood. “Why? Are you thinking about taking someone special?” 
	“Well, I was thinking about it, but if it’s…. uh…. lame, then you know, it’s not a big deal,” Seth answered nonchalantly.
	“No, it’s not lame. I mean, I don’t think it’s lame. It’s a dance, so it’s going to be fun,” I shrugged my shoulder not wanting to put pressure on him to go. So much of his time at school was spent with me and my friends that I wanted to give Seth as much space as he needed to make his own life there, choose his own friends…. even date if he felt so inclined or gave into the throng of girls who seemed to worship at his feet. 
	“So you’re going?” Seth pressed, crossing his blades in front of him and across the heads…. or head-like places of two Shadows. 
	“That’s the plan,” I agreed. Finally there seemed to be a dwindling of Shadows as the wall of attack seemed to slow. I could see Serena and Nate clearly through the last of the lurking evil, finishing their individual piles as the dead and slaughtered disappeared into the night as if they really were smoke, back to Hell, back to where they came from.
	“Are you going alone….? Or do you and Tristan already have plans?” Seth asked and then cleared his throat quickly. I looked up at him, feeling slight traces of anxiety and watched as he threw himself into the last dregs of battle, flipping into the air and finishing what was left of the Shadows in graceful, expert moves. His body burned with light and his movements left residual traces in the air around him.
	“What? Tristan?” I asked and shook my head although I was pretty sure he wasn’t looking at me. “Tristan and I never go to dances together. People already have a hard enough time believing we’re just friends! Showing up at a dance together would be like…. it would be like…. well, we would never live it down!” I laughed a little. I plunged my katana into the last of the Shadows, taking my time and twisting the blade to ensure death. The Shadow fell away and poofed into black, insubstantial nothingness before its blood had even stopped splattering.
	I lowered my swords and looked around at the nearly empty battlefield. The desolate African plain was mostly obscured by night, but I relished in the dry, hot air. I loved feeling the heat on my bare arms and wished more than anything I had traded in my yoga pants for shorts. The cracked, dry earth spread out like a sea of sandpaper around me. The different, foreign grasses of Africa waved in a gentle night breeze, sending scents of freshness and earthiness to invade my senses. 
	I needed to start traveling. 
	On a regular basis. 
	Without all the blood and carnage and saving the world stuff….
	Serena and Nate joined us in a tight circle as the last of the Shadows disappeared back to the inner most circle of hell. Good riddance. 
	“Do you know what their plan was tonight?” Seth asked Nate as he wiped blood off his hands with a bandana he pulled from his back pocket.
	“Not the particulars, it’s hard to get definite information from them in between all the shrieking,” Nate smiled easily, lightening the tension from fighting. 
	“It really is the worst,” I agreed, looking up at a sky full of Stars. Even the wide open Nebraska sky couldn’t compare to the vast array of constellations and twinkling of Heaven’s army in their battle formations on display from this empty African valley.  
	“No, the smell,” Serena groaned dramatically, “the smell is definitely the worst! Off planet we didn’t have to deal with these small demons and there was never the stench.” She shuddered again, her orange hair shaking with her movement like living fire. 
	“I could live without the smell,” I agreed, realizing I would never get the chance. 
	Silence fell over us as Serena and Nate pulled out a couple of water bottles and offered them to Seth and me. I took it gratefully, wiping my mouth of sweat, dirt and speckles of blood on the inside of my t-shirt before taking a long drink. 
	It was in the silence that I felt the chill of another evil creep over my skin slowly and softly, as if it were a whisper of something sinister floating down from a high place, or echoing off the distant mountains. The hairs on my arms rose in alarm, and I looked around quickly trying to find the source. 
	Nobody else seemed to notice the drop in temperature or the feeling like we were being watched; watched by somebody calculating our moves…. our conversations…. our abilities. There were not a lot of places for somebody to hide out here, this far from any kind of civilization. A few clusters of cluttered brush dotted the horizon, but nothing that could hide the depth of evil I felt present. 
	“Do you guys feel that?” I whispered, interrupting the conversation the other three had fallen into.
	“Feel what?” Nate asked, his instincts on high alert with the mere idea of me feeling unease.
	“I don’t know what,” I half-grunted in frustration. “It’s like…. it’s like I can feel an evil presence out there, but I can’t at the same time. It’s almost like an echo of evil instead of the real thing….”
	“Stella you’re going to have to explain better than that,” Seth pressed gently, putting a strong hand on my lower back to encourage me to be clearer. He looked around at the plain, the same way I had done, his narrowed eyes scrutinizing through the darkness, struggling to find some remnant of remaining evil.
	“I don’t know how to explain it better,” I sighed, feeling the threat disappear with each word spoken out loud. Maybe I imagined it. “You felt them before, right?” I asked Seth, hoping I hadn’t imagined that too. “When we fought at Lincoln’s farm?” 
	“Yes,” Seth replied confidently and then shifted uncomfortably before adding, “Well, I thought I saw them more than felt anything, but I can’t be all that sure. But you saw them and felt them so I know they were real.”
	I winced, wishing more than anything I didn’t feel like a crazy person right now. “And you guys don’t feel anything now?” I held each of their gazes for a moment, pleading with them to feel what I did, but only concern and sympathy met me. 
	“No, I don’t,” Serena said gently. “That doesn’t mean anything though, I didn’t feel anything the night you fought so close to your home. We didn’t even know you were in trouble.” She gestured between herself and Nate and he kind of shook his head as if her were ashamed. “So maybe there is something blocking our senses.”
	“Is that even possible?” I groaned. How could I do my job correctly if I couldn’t rely on my senses, they were supposed to be my guide on Earth, they were what I counted on to lead me to evil. 
	“I don’t know,” Nate answered thoughtfully. He was contemplating Serena’s idea, I could see his mind working, his brain trying to come up with a conclusion to this mystery. I wondered if one of his solutions included me being crazy. 
	As if he could sense what I was thinking, Seth slipped his strong, albeit grimy hand around mine and squeezed it gently. The feeling that we were being watched, or joined by evil…. or whatever that feeling was had completely evaporated by now and I felt foolish making a big deal out of nothing. If what I was sensing were more Shadows they would have attacked us, they are almost incapable of not attacking us when they met us. And if it were Fallen sent to spy on us, the others would have felt them too. That was one advantage to being a Star, we had all these exterior senses that gave us insight into the supernatural world that existed alongside the physical world on Earth.
	I shook my head, and tried to smile confidently, “Maybe these feelings are just my reaction to battle the first couple of times. I haven’t exactly been raised around this kind of stuff.” 
	“Maybe,” Serena agreed thoughtfully. “But I think it would be a good idea to talk to Jupiter about it when you get home. He might have more insight into what you’re feeling, or if the rest of us are broken he should know about that too, maybe even know what to do about it.” 
	“You guys don’t look broken to me,” I changed the subject, not willing to dwell on my potential insanity. “You were incredible tonight, really.” 
“Thank you,” Nate beamed at me. He probably wasn’t used to compliments in the solitude of battle formations in space. “You’re looking pretty fantastic out there too, Stella. You’ve really come a long way in a short amount of time.”
“Thank you,” I blushed.
“Hey what about me? Wasn’t I amazing?” Seth demanded; his mouth turning up at the corners even though he was desperately trying not to smile. 
“Oh yes, quite amazing,” Serena quipped sarcastically. “But we always knew you would be.” She patted his shoulder consolingly and I understood her words and gesture as a reference to his parents. Silence followed for a few more minutes before Serena’s head perked up, her eyes burning with concentration as if she really were a stereotypical alien, white light poured from her face, blurring the color of her irises and concealing her pretty face. “Do you feel that Nate?” 
“Yes, is that… London?” he asked and I watched in quiet awe as every one of his muscles reawakened, tensing into readiness.
“Busy night, I guess,” Serena mumbled, tilting her head as if she were actually listening. She was using her set of external senses, feeling a greater than normal disturbance of Shadows. I would get the sense too, after I turned eighteen. When I could feel the Shadows congregating in the rest of the world it would be one of the signs that I was ready to inherit the Protectorship.
“Do you need us to follow?” Seth asked, shifting on his feet and reaching a hand behind his head to rub at the base of his hairline.
“No, this is lighter fare,” Serena almost smiled in response. She was all Angelic Warrior, her skin heating into a gorgeous glow and the bloodlust returned to her backlit eyes. “If we get into a jam we’ll call, otherwise we’ll send Jupiter an update in the morning.” 
“If you’re sure,” Seth nodded, extending his hand to Nate who shook it firmly. 
“Go home, get some rest,” Nate said in way of goodbye. “Don’t you have school in the morning?” he laughed and Serena joined him, reminding me that my human education would always be a bit of a joke to these people. 
I said goodbye to Serena in much the same way as Seth and Nate had, hoping to showcase the mature-soldier side to my nature. I wondered if I would ever command the battlefield like Serena had or treat the inheritance I’d been given with her level of reverence and bloodthirsty excitement. 
Not that I wasn’t completely devoted to my future, but Nate was right, I had school in the morning. And it was hard to picture a future that didn’t include friends, or even family save for Seth who would by then be my husband…. 
It was hard to see past the Valentine’s Dance in two weeks when I didn’t even have a dress picked out or any prospect of a date. 

----

	“I think we treat these…. feelings with caution for now,” Jupiter lectured over the breakfast table the next morning. “I’m not willing to rule them out completely, but there is a certain safety in numbers so to speak and right now the numbers are standing on the opposite side of the argument, Stella.” 
	It was very early, not even light yet, but my parents, Jupiter, Seth and I had all congregated around boxes of cereal and fresh milk bought from a farm down the road, to discuss last night’s African battle and my lingering bad feelings. Seth and I returned very late last night, after the long journey from East Africa and now we were up, just hours later, trying to have coherent conversations and relay the now muddled details of the battle. 
	“And this is only the second time you’ve had these…. feelings?” My mother asked, wrapping a protective arm around me. She looked deeply concerned, as if we were discussing the possibility of me having cancer and not a case of mistaken instincts.
	“Yes,” I nodded quickly, my unruly bedhead hair shaking out around my shoulders. I paused for a moment, wrapping it into a loose bun at the nape of my neck. “Ok, no it wasn’t the second time. Sometimes I get the same feeling when I’m not fighting…. when I’m just, I don’t know, just going about my daily life. But when I have the feeling then, it’s not nearly as strong and there is always something there to justify them, like a lone Shadow, or a few Shadows interfering with kids at school or something. After the last two fights, the feeling has been very intense, like whoever is behind it is organizing the latest attacks, orchestrating them in some way to find out what I’m capable of, or what we’re capable of.” I gestured between Seth and me with my pointer finger.
	“It’s not that I don’t think they’re clever enough to think of something like that,” Jupiter jumped back in, his dull red eyes focused on the ceiling as if waiting for the right answer to just fall from the sky. “But, what unnerves me is that nobody else has noticed the same feelings, not even Seth and he has been present twice now. Nate and Serena are vetted fighters, used to feeling the Darkness from light years away….” 
	He trailed off, finally letting his eyes fall on my father’s and shrugging his shoulder as if there was nothing else he could do. My father stared at him for a moment as if deciding whether or not to trust Jupiter and then he turned to me apologetically. 
	“There really isn’t anything to do now anyway. If someone is out there watching you, then you’ll come face to face with them soon enough and if these feelings are just residual emotions from battle, they will disappear after a little more experience. We are not in a position to hunt down any Fallen right now, so our hands are virtually tied. We will treat these feelings with caution, like Jupiter said, but for now that’s all we can do. How does that sound Stella-bean?” 
	“That sounds great,” I agreed, although I didn’t put much effort into any enthusiasm. I knew there was nothing they could really do; I had known that from the beginning. I just wanted to be told I wasn’t crazy, which wasn’t exactly the answer I received. It was a more of a “gee, we sure hope you’re not crazy because all of our eggs are kind of in one basket here” situation. 
	“And we trust Serena and Nate?” Seth asked, clearing his throat afterward.
	The kitchen was silent for a while after his pointed question. Jupiter looked thoughtfully at him, while my parents seemed to avoid looking at him altogether. Another Star’s loyalty should never be called into question because by that point usually we had been betrayed and then some. But at the same time we were operating in completely uncharted waters and even the High Council could not be trusted these days. So Seth did have a very legitimate reason for asking his question. 
	Jupiter replied first and I had to wonder if he had less attachment to Serena and Nate simply because he wasn’t actually sent from Heaven, but more of a lone refugee that had survived the Darkness and was now hired by Heaven to be a sort of consultant of all things Darkness-related.
	“I have absolutely no reason to believe that they would be spies,” Jupiter declared with a certain finality. “That being said, they would make the best kind of spies.”
	Seth smiled a little at Jupiter’s roundabout explanation and turned to me. “How about you, what do you feel about them?’
	“I haven’t really known them that long,” I replied, not willing to say anything that could potentially be misguiding or misunderstood and by consequence condemn Nate and Serena. True, I had only known them for a short time, but they were amazing, skilled fighters that had not hesitated once last night no matter the skill level. And there lights were bright, blinding even. 
	But I had never been betrayed before either, or even met a member of the Fallen. I wasn’t really much of an expert.
	“Stella, what do you feel?” Seth pressed, putting his strong, masculine hand over my heart. 
	I laid a hand on top of his, threading my fingers through the back of his. “I feel like we can trust them, like they’re fighting the same battle we are,” I answered honestly, although if they were evil it might explain away the feelings I always got and their mysterious absence during my first battle.
	“And they’re doing their job,” Jupiter grunted. 
	“So we trust them,” Seth announced and then so quietly I knew I was the only one who heard him, “at least for now.” 
	“Stella, keep us updated on any new developments with your…. feelings,” my dad instructed and I tried not to feel irritated with the way everyone kept pausing before they mentioned my haywire senses as if they should all be using air-quotes and snickering at the end of their sentences. “And for now we will proceed cautiously. Jupiter, you still haven’t heard from the Elders?” 
	Jupiter shook his head negatively, but before he could fully answer my father’s question the “Bat Phone” rang and he headed into the other room to garner his report from Serena and Nate. I assumed because the phone rang that they had made it back home and to our or a closely-related time-zone. 
	I stood up and stretched, taking my empty cereal bowl over to the sink to rinse it out and Seth followed me. My parents fell into a serious, hushed conversation and I had to wonder if they were as worried about my mental health as I was. 
	Had the High Council traitor known somehow that I would be a loose cannon and that’s why there was a push to choose my parents for Earth, and me for the future Protector job?
	I shuddered at the thought of being used because I was weak, or picked because I would never be able to fulfill my duties. My entire body bristled at the idea of someone not thinking I was up for the task and a Warrior instinct flared inside of me to prove them wrong. There were so many human stories about overcoming great odds: marathon runners who had lost both legs, blind piano players, paralyzed artists…. That’s what I would become, the crazy-Angel who should have been locked up in a home for the helpless but overcame adversity to fight evil instead.
	Yep, might as well make an action movie out of it. Summer blockbuster, here I come….
	“Hey, so I have a question for you,” Seth asked softly, pulling me out of my depressing daydream. “But can we go somewhere and talk?” 
	I looked up at him, not realizing I had taken his bowl from him and rinsed it out too. Oops, spacing out was so not an acceptable personality trait in this line of work. 
	“Sure, what do you want to talk about?” I asked casually although the prospect both excited and terrified me. On the one hand, his sleep-styled hair was extremely sexy and made me daydream of what it would be like to sleep next to his heated, muscly body. His honey colored eyes still burned from the intensity of battle last night. My skin warmed into a soft glow just taking in his angled, gorgeous face and his rippled muscles that begged me to trace their peaks and valleys while he walked around shirtless. I mean honestly, it didn’t seem fair that he could crash for only a few hours and then wake up looking this delicious. But on the other hand, I was fighting the attraction between us, holding on to the last remnants of youth and freedom I had left. And my almost kiss with Tristan still heated my blood faster than I could ever admit to myself. Tristan’s body that close…. his warm breath against my face, his lips just a second from touching mine hung like an oppressive cloud of want and need anchoring me solidly to the ground. 
	“Well,” Seth continued, rubbing his palm against his jawline, “it’s not about any of this, if that makes you feel better.” 
	“It really does,” I smiled, and let him lead me into our family room.
	“So, I know we are taking…. we are waiting to kind of claim this future that’s between us, at least until we’re eighteen and all….” Seth paused, looking around the cozy family room with our worn L-shaped couch and hanging picture frames of my youth. His eyes heated in just the tiniest of ways and a butterfly flapped its wings aggressively in my stomach and not in the giddy-girl kind of way, but in the holy-crap-where’s-he-going-with-this kind of way. He turned to me, his eyes holding my gaze prisoner and his hands reaching out for mine that reciprocated because I couldn’t think of a reason not to. “What I’m trying to ask is, will you go to the Valentine’s Dance with me?”
	My breath rushed out of my chest in an embarrassing sigh of relief. I didn’t know what I was so afraid of, but apparently the Valentine’s Dance was definitely not it. “Yes, of course I will.” I smiled at him, enjoying the way his skin glowed naturally in response. 
	“You’re going to have to fill me in on the finer points of one of these things,” Seth confessed, his cheeks turning just the slightest shade of red. “I’ve never been to a dance before.”
	“You’ll do fine,” I assured him. “Boys like you were made for high school dances.”

Chapter Thirteen

	“We need to talk,” Piper declared after third period when we were putting our text books away to prepare for choir. Mead had a small chorus, with only twenty students from the whole high school and somehow Piper convinced me every year to join it. She promised a “choir letter” would look great on my college applications and I humored her since I knew she genuinely enjoyed the class and because I didn’t have the heart to inform her I wouldn’t be going to college. 
	“What about?” I asked, linking my arm with hers and pulling her toward the music room. This was the only class we walked to alone. Tristan, Rigley, Lincoln and even Seth all opted for weight training this hour. We were free to discuss whatever we wanted without their nosey little ears listening in on every word and phrase uttered between us. 
	“Lincoln asked me to the Valentine’s Dance,” Piper spat out as if the words almost pained her. 
	“And…. you don’t want to go with him?” I guessed, noticing the way Piper’s nose scrunched up at the very thought of it. 
	“Of course I don’t want to go with him! It goes against everything I stand for…. everything I believe in!” She huffed dramatically; reaching up to untangle her dark hair from a hoop earring that could easily have doubled as a bracelet it was so large.
	“Which part, the dance or Lincoln?” I asked, trying to make sense of Piper’s thought train before I formed my counterargument. 
	“Both,” she grunted, letting her face fall into her hands. 
	“When did he ask you?” I questioned, only because the last I heard Lincoln and her still weren’t on speaking terms. They were definitely on “giving each other longing glances and sexy eyes” terms, just not ones that included verbal communication. 
	“At the end of last period,” she sighed. “There were even kisses and hugs involved?” 
	“What?” I shrieked. 
	“Of the candy variety….” She sighed again and held up a cute Valentine’s card attached to an even cuter heart shape box filled with Hershey’s kisses and hugs. My heart melted a little in happiness for my friend until I saw the tortured look in her eyes.
	“That is so sweet,” I murmured, running my finger along the box. 
	“I don’t know what he sees in me,” she grumbled, looking down at the box with a mixture of fear and angst warping her pretty face.
	“It’s because you basically stole his virginity,” Bree interrupted, joining us just on the outside of the choir room door. 
	“She did not!” I defended Piper, shooting Bree a look I hoped would make the worst kind of evil flee from. Apparently my glares only worked on the supernatural kind of villain because she stayed firmly rooted next to us. 
	“Exactly!” Piper ignored my attempt at defending her honor. “It’s because he felt obligated to ask me!” her shoulders sagged.
	I tried my best to shrug off the irritation that twisted my stomach when Bree put her arm around Piper to comfort her. 
	“I’m pretty sure he feels something, but it’s definitely not obligation,” she laughed.
	“Oh, no! What if he expects me to…. you know, pick up where we left off? What if that’s the only reason he asked me?” Piper whispered, looking around the hallway like the entire student body was listening in and judging her. 
	“No, Piper-“ I started to reassure her, when Bree cut in again. My temper simmered just below my slowly glowing skin. 
	“Piper he’s a guy, of course he’s hoping for a piece of this,” she gestured to Piper’s body and then smacked her on the butt. “But he’s lost his mind if he expects anything.”
	“For once, I agree with Bree,” I sighed, seeing that Piper was somehow pacified. “So you’re going to go with him?” I coaxed, hoping to sound as encouraging and approving as possible. I loved the idea of Lincoln and Piper together and if I had to work overtime to ensure no more Shadows interfered with what should be happily high school bliss, then that is what I would do. 
	“Ladies, care to join us?” Mr. Hale, the choir director called from inside the classroom where he had just started warm ups. 
	“Stella, your skin….” Piper whispered as we walked into the classroom, reaching out for my arm. I blanched, but had already reigned in my totally uncalled for anger.   
	“What?” I pretended panic, grabbing at my face. Her eyes softened once we were inside the music room.
	“Nothing….” she mumbled. “It must have been the hallway light. You kind of looked like you were glowing.” 
	“Like good Angelic glowing? Or like neon, I was just turned into a teenage mutant ninja turtle glowing?” I asked, shaking off her claims.
	“Definitely radioactive,” she laughed out loud which caught us a stern look from the director’s chair. 
	I laughed too, mostly to cover my disappointment. Feeling a little defensive, I wanted to explain everything to Piper just to appease my vanity. Instead I kept quiet, images of giant, green amphibians distracting me for the majority of class. Piper and I had been friends since kindergarten and she had never, not even once, noticed a difference in me. I was getting closer to my eighteenth birthday though and that meant everything about being a Star would amplify tenfold. I would have to be more careful. 
	Lunch was directly after choir and as we walked to the cafeteria, the conversation about Lincoln picked up right where we left it. 
	“So did you tell him yes?” Bree pried, not even bothering with a greeting. I bit back the feeling that she cared more about Piper as a way to spread gossip than she did a friend and waited for Piper’s answer. 
	“Yes,” Piper admitted almost reluctantly. “I just can’t tell him ‘no….’” she sighed and then stood up straighter, “I mean, I can tell him ‘no’ when I need to tell him ‘no,’ I just couldn’t tell him ‘no’ in that particular situation.” She rushed to explain herself, her blush covering her smattering of freckles and Bree and I both burst into laughter.     
	“Sure you can, Pi,” I gasped between laughter. 
	“Well, at least one of us has a date,” Bree sounded dejected as she sat down at our usual lunch table, shooting a frustrated glance Tristan’s way. 
	I followed her glance and forced myself to unclench my fist from the lunch table before I broke off a piece with my super Star strength. Tristan didn’t even acknowledge her though as we situated ourselves across from the boys, me taking my usual seat next to Seth. For my entire life participating in the Mead public school system, boys sat on one side of the table and girls sat on the other. Seth was disrupting our carefully drawn sexist line, but it kind of made me happy.
	Seth smiled down at me, completely oblivious to the way the entire length of the table looked at his barrier breaking with a mixture of awe and disapproval. 
	“Hey,” I smiled at him, noticing how his hair curled delicately while it was still damp from his after-weight-training-shower.
	“Hey,” he smiled back. “Is she talking about you?” he nodded his chin to Bree, and I blushed realizing the majority of our group caught his meaning. 
	“You have a date to what?” Tristan asked his voice cutting through the air like a punch in the throat. 
	“The Valentine’s Dance,” I smiled warmly at him, cocking my head to the side in confusion. 
	Tristan’s green eyes flashed with undisguised anger, and he set his sandwich down on the table very, very carefully. I knew that gesture from watching him play years of contact sports; Tristan didn’t become careful until controlling every single one of his movements became essential to reigning in his temper. 
	“You’re going to the Valentine’s Dance with him?” he asked as if even referencing Seth took concentrated effort. 
	“Yes,” I replied, forcing my voice to sound like it was no big deal. Silence fell heavily on our table as the rest of us were left to wonder at Tristan’s reaction. I felt Seth stiffen next to me, ready to defend some honor that had been questioned, but I put my hand on his arm casually, hoping no one else would notice and squeezed. He caught my hint and let it go, but I felt how his skin heated beneath my fingers. He would let this go, but only for me. 
	“You and Seth are going together? You should have told me! When did this happen?” Piper squealed happily. 
	I turned my head so that all I could see was Piper, completely ignoring Tristan in my peripheral. He picked up his sandwich like he was going to take a bite and then set it back down as if he couldn’t stomach it. I could feel his stare boring into me from across the table but for the life of me I couldn’t figure out why. 
	Tristan had never, not in our entire lives, not once…. asked me to a dance. He didn’t ask me in sixth grade when we only had one dance and I had been a frantic mess about finding a date for months. He didn’t ask me ever in junior high when dances became more frequent and I had to endure trying out nearly every boy in our class just to be polite. And he had not once asked me to a dance in high school, even though he had made his rounds through all of the prettiest girls from our class and the surrounding classes. In fact, when a dance was on the horizon he avoided me like I was a tumor to his effortless charm that made any and every girl in school immediately agree to be his date. 
	I had been snubbed more times than I liked to remember. 
	And now he was mad because I had a date? 
	Oh… no.
	“Yes, Seth asked me this morning!” I forced as much excitement into my voice as possible, hoping I would get a chance to explain to Seth later. I knew it just made sense for Seth and I to go together. He certainly wasn’t going to ask anyone else; he didn’t even really know anyone else. And I probably was obligated to be his date from this dance on until the rest of eternity anyway. 
	My enthusiasm dropped as I thought that all the way through. Was this the beginning of the rest of my life with Seth? 
	“Well, won’t you guys be cute,” Bree offered snidely from the other side of Piper. 
	A grunt of frustrated anger tore through the air from across the table, and I snapped my head in Tristan’s direction surprised at his outburst. Apparently he was just as surprised, because heat turned his neck a shade darker and he mumbled something about a charley horse in his calf before shooting me a look. A look that displayed a sharp mixture of hurt and betrayal that I in no way understood. 
	“Who are you going with?” Piper asked Tristan innocently, as if his mood wasn’t quieting the entire table.
	“I don’t have a date yet,” he admitted, giving me another pointed look. I shot him back one out of confusion, but he wasn’t offering any explanations. 
	“Well, you should get on that before all the pretty girls are taken,” Piper continued, lecturing him sternly. “Or maybe you’re more of a sit back and let it come to you kind of guy,” she finished with a certain amount of hatred in her voice she reserved only for the worst disagreements between her and Tristan. “The problem is, the good things in life don’t just fall in your lap, Tristan. You have to work for those.” 
	And with that, Piper stood up and walked out of the cafeteria. I stared after her with my mouth slightly ajar, feeling more confused than ever. I looked over at Tristan who seemed even more pissed off, if that was even possible. After two more seconds of pained silence, he too got up and stormed out of the cafeteria in the opposite direction. 
	I slumped down in the bench, realizing I had been at the root of both my friends’ issues, but not understanding one better than the other. 
	“Lunch can be really intense here,” Seth mumbled, nudging me with his shoulder. 
	“That’s one way of putting it,” Rigley agreed, shaking his head in disbelief. 
	I stayed silent, having no idea what set Piper off, even though I had a pretty good idea of what had Tristan all upset and it had to do with the betrothed Angel that was sitting right next to me. I looked up at Seth as he dove into the school provided chicken and noodles. His jaw flexed as if he could still acutely feel the tension floating over our table, but without pausing from taking a bite he put his arm around me, squeezing my shoulder comfortingly.
	Seth was my future, my whole future. And at some point my present would melt into that future. I wouldn’t be able to have this simplified existence of friends and small town life forever. Things were already changing for me…. I was already changing.

----

	I saw the truck before I heard it, ambling down our long gravel drive, banks of snow rising on either side, blurring the lines of his white truck with the horizon. I watched him out my bedroom window, suddenly more nervous to be near him than I felt before I went into battle. 
	We both had the rare afternoon off, no basketball practice, no training, absolutely nothing to do after school. Before…. before things got weird, Tristan and I would have taken the opportunity to plan something exciting like a trip into Omaha for a movie or dinner at a chain restaurant, or pulling each other on sleds behind his four-wheelers. 
	But after lunch today Tristan avoided me, leaving his mystery anger all that more of a mystery. I stayed in my bedroom, still watching as he parked his truck and hesitated for a good three minutes before climbing down from the cab and walking to the kitchen door. I heard the doorbell ring and my mom move to the door, but something held my feet frozen to the carpet. 
	Fear.
	It felt like he was coming to break up with me. 
	Break up our friendship. 
	“Stella,” my mom called from downstairs. “Tristan’s here!”
	“Be right down,” I hollered back and then forced my feet to move. They didn’t go where I told them to immediately. First they stopped, without my permission, in front of my vanity so that I could check out my makeup and fix my hair until it fell in golden waves just so over my shoulder. I reached for my lip gloss before making myself stop and take a breath to steady my shaking hands. 
	It was just Tristan. 
	My best friend. 
	My oldest friend.
	I was acting crazy. 
	Well…. more crazy than even normal-crazy these days.
	He was waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs, making comfortable conversation with my mom as she started pulling together dinner. Tonight it looked like we were having…. spaghetti…. again. Ooh… with frozen meatballs. This was definitely a step up as far as family dinners went around here. 
	“Hey,” I interrupted once I reached the last stair. Tristan’s eyes had been watching me as I made my way down the stairs, but now that I stood before him they floated over me as if gently caressing me in the most intimate way. Eventually the emerald depth of his gaze found mine again and I nearly took a step back from the intensity of it.
	Lifting his shoulder in an attempt at humility he offered a quiet, “Hey,” back. “Can we talk?” 
	I nodded, a little taken back by how sweet I found him right now. There was this almost desperate ache that started in the deepest part of me and spread rapidly over every single one of my bones. I moved toward him, not conscious of my decision until my arms were around his neck and my head was buried against his chest. 
	“Hey….” he soothed gently, wrapping his arms tightly around my waist. “Hey, it’s Ok. Don’t be upset. I’m so sorry, Stella, I didn’t mean to make you feel bad, Ok? It’s all my fault, I was such a jerk today.”
	A shudder ran over my back at the intimacy of our closeness. We hugged all the time, so when Tristan’s body responded to mine, pulling me impossibly closer to him and molding me against his lean body, I was surprised at the tender affection he seemed to wrap around me. One of his hands held me tightly against my waist, his hand slid under my shirt and splayed against my hot flesh. His other hand had pressed itself against the nape of my neck, his thumb was moving up and down in the most tender way.
	“You were a jerk,” I mumbled against his skin. I picked up my head just a little bit. “I seriously don’t even understand why, either. You’ve never cared who I’ve gone to a dance with before….” I said pathetically, feeling ridiculous for taking this so seriously. It was just that we never fought. Ever. And he never got mad at me.
	“Well,  you’ve never been asked to a school dance before by your future husband,” he explained, acid painting the word “husband” as if it were the dirtiest word in the English language.
	“You’re jealous?” I gasped, taking a step back and putting space in between us. Talking about Tristan’s feelings for me, while I was wrapped up in his arms seemed like a very bad idea, said the sudden voice of reason in my head.
	“I like to think I’m looking out for your best interest,” he said confidently, but his eyes refused to look at me.
	“Well, I’m pretty sure since my relationship with Seth was ordained by an entire council of Elders. So probably I’m pretty safe to go with him to a Valentine’s Dance,” I shot back smugly, noticing for the first time my mom had slipped out of the kitchen. 
	Tristan winced in response, pulling me back against his body. I could feel how every one of his muscles had tensed and coiled, the quiet desperation in which he held me.
	“Don’t remind me,” he sighed, tangling his hand through my hair. 
	“Did you want to go with me?” I ventured, my voice sounding small and not at all like me.
	“It doesn’t matter what I want, Stella. I can’t go with you. Isn’t that right? I can’t go with you to dances. I can’t ask you out on dates. I can’t….” he trailed off, running his thumb down the nape of my neck. His mouth had turned into a serious, straight line and I felt the muscles in his chest tighten. “We are just friends,” he stated, bitterness seeping into his every syllable. “I know I don’t get an opinion about who takes you to the dance…. I just…. I just thought you and Seth weren’t like that yet.” His tone had softened and the brokenness behind his words nearly shattered me. 
	There were things between Tristan and I that had hovered in the air between us unspoken for years. At some point during our long history together we had mutually decided those secret things could never be said, never be spoken out loud. Tristan was dangerously close to saying things now, which he could never take back, never unsay and I couldn’t let him break the silent truce between us.
	“We’re not,” I defended myself, stepping out of Tristan’s arms and crossing to the other side of the kitchen. “We’re not like that. How could we be? We just met. But I am one of the only people he knows, and I didn’t have a date, so it just made sense.” 
	Tristan made a grunting sound, rubbing one hand over his closely shaven head. He looked at me out of the corner of his eye and then broke into a smile, his dimples adorably impressed next to his smile. A husky laugh followed and his shoulders relaxed into the guy I knew so well.
	“I’m not going to make it through this,” he laughed again in a seemingly self-deprecating way. 
	“Make it through what?” I asked, leaning back against the counter. I stirred my mom’s spaghetti sauce that had started to bubble over, shooting drops of red sauce all over the white stove surface.
	“High school,” Tristan mumbled. Although neither one of us believed that’s what he meant, but I let it go. I had to let it go…. 
	“So, no more weirdness between us, yeah?” I looked up at him from under my lashes and hoped he would just agree. 
	“No more weirdness,” he met my gaze and I wanted to believe him…. I wanted to believe that we had this thing under control, but his piercing eyes held too much of the unsaid, too much of what we weren’t allowed to say that they practically overflowed with it.
	My breath caught in the base of my throat and I knew I had to navigate us out of these dangerous waters before we were both drowning. 
	“So who are you going to take to the dance?” I asked carefully.
	“Don’t hate me,” he smiled, his charming Tristan smile and I immediately knew I was not going to like where this was going. 
	“Why?” I demanded, straightening my back and chewing on my bottom lip aggressively. 
	“Well, first of all, this is a funny dance because most of the eligible girls already have dates. My options were limited. No, worse than that! I didn’t even really have options!” he rambled on, gesturing a lot with his hands, which I knew was a terrible sign of things to come.
	“Spit it out, Tristan,” I growled.
	“Bree,” he said simply and my jaw dropped, literally it dropped as if it were on hinges. 
	“No you are not,” I laughed at the irony. And he was mad about Seth? Ha! 
	“She was the only girl I felt comfortable asking,” he explained, but it wouldn’t have mattered if he told me she held a gun to his head and kidnapped his family. I couldn’t believe he was actually going with Bree. 
	He knew better.
	He had picked his way through most of the high school, but never asked Bree. 
	“Oh really? You’re not doing this out of spite?” I pressed, digging my heels into this argument and refusing to back down.
	“Spite? Come one, Stel, you know me better than that. She didn’t have a date and either did I. It just made sense. You know she is a good friend of ours,” Tristan tried to remind me, but this he really did know better. 
	“She’s a good friend of yours,” I muttered, afraid my parents would hear. I reminded myself of Bree’s humanity and that she was one of the billions of reasons I resided on this planet to begin with, trying without success to get over her now rightful claim of Tristan. At least for the dance. 
	But it shouldn’t matter anyway.
	I had Seth.
	“You’re not really mad, are you?” Tristan walked up next to me while I stewed about Bree. He placed a hand on my lower back, hoping for forgiveness. My head inclined immediately toward him, as if I was a sunflower and he was my sun. I felt each of his fingers as they widened across my back and felt his blood pulsing beneath his skin, the pads of his fingertips as they burned their mark into my flesh. 
	“Do you want to stay for dinner? My mom is changing it up a bit by adding meatballs to our spaghetti,” I turned to face him, forcing myself to keep some distance between us. I needed to change the subject; I needed to balance our relationship back in the realm of normal. 
	“Meatballs? Is this a special occasion?” he asked and we both laughed.
	But he did stay, and he laughed and talked and enjoyed my family just like he always had. We would be fine. Things were changing in my life, but Tristan and I could survive the change. Things could stay the same.
	No, I was determined. Things would stay the same.
Chapter Fourteen

	“Stella,” mom stood in my doorway; that look on her face…. the one that promised me I was in for an important parental lecture. “We should talk, sweet pea.”
	“Sure, come on in,” I gestured to my desk chair with a confident sweep of my arm, even though internally my insides had twisted tightly together in anticipation for whatever this was about.
	She walked inside my room, wringing her hands together. I sat up from my reclined position where I was studying for a Government test the next day and waited for her to continue. Some of my anxiety was relieved when I realized how nervous she was. 
	And then it was instantly replaced when nightmarish thoughts of an impending birds and bees discussion echoed in my head.
	“Mom, you’re not here to talk to me about-“
	“Your dad and I are sorry!” my mom blurted out suddenly, plopping heavily into my desk chair and twisting her long, platinum blonde hair into a knot at the base of her neck. Her golden, light amber eyes were wide with intensity and her flawless skin glowed naturally as sincerity seeped through her. 
	“Mom, what are you sorry for?” I laughed nervously. 
	  She was definitely not comforted by my candor though. Her brows knitted together in an expression I had only ever seen her wear when she was preparing for a mission. “We didn’t know, Stel. We didn’t know you and Tristan would develop feelings for each other…. Honestly, we didn’t even know you could develop feelings for anyone other than Seth.”
	“Mom, what are you talking about?” I breathed in a voice I could barely hear. My hands were suddenly shaking and I gripped the quilt Annabelle had made me as a little girl tightly in my fists. 
	“Tristan,” she said simply and the lump lodged in my throat that had been steadily making it harder to swallow grew exponentially larger and then dropped like a boulder into the pit of my stomach. “We never enforced boundaries between you two, or discouraged any feelings that we might have noticed developing between you. It’s just that, well honestly, we assumed that once you met Seth, whatever feelings that had blossomed between the two of you would dissipate. And you weren’t supposed to meet Seth for years yet. Honestly, Stella, we didn’t know you’re feelings for Tristan were so deep and Seth is your intended, the Elders themselves matched the two of you….” she trailed off, her eyes pleading with me to understand. I had never heard my mother ramble before. Never. The sound of her nervous energy lacing words I was having trouble understanding shook me.
	I wanted to reassure my mom that whatever weirdness was happening between Tristan and I had absolutely nothing to do with deep seeded and forbidden feelings between us. But instead of quickly explaining away her fears, my mouth kind of just fell open and I sat in stunned silence, realizing my mom and dad had actually expected me to fall head over heels in love with Seth the moment he walked into my life.
	A flare of treacherous rebellion flared deep in my belly. I didn’t want to fall in love with someone because I was supposed to or told to or stop every emotion and feeling I had because someone else had decided my future.
	I was born for a specific purpose and even gifted my life on Earth with expectations for a future. But suddenly I wasn’t sure what my love life had to do with any of it. 
	I knew these were awful thoughts. And in the back of my head, I hoped they would disappear. Stars married Angels. That was the way things worked. Seth was my counterpart in every way; he would complement me in every way. We would protect Earth together. 
	I just wanted our relationship to feel natural and not forced. 
	And I especially wanted to forget about Tristan.
	No. I needed to forget about Tristan. 
	“Mom, you have nothing to worry about,” I promised, hoping to alleviate as many of my own fears as hers. “Tristan and I have always been just friends. You might not have given us boundaries, but we have them, believe me. And neither one of us plans on crossing them anytime soon.” I gnawed on my bottom lip, hoping I at least sounded confident. My internal organs had started to rearrange themselves into compactly wound knots, and the nape of my neck prickled sharply with heat. 
	“We trust you both, Stella,” my mom answered, sounding more parental than her apology had allowed for. “We know how hard you and Tristan have worked to maintain a platonic relationship. You both have respected your future amazingly well, and we applaud you for that.” She smiled sadly at me and that’s when I felt the “but” coming. “But, up until now Tristan hasn’t had any competition. Your father and I are concerned for how Seth’s presence could amplify feelings between the two of you. Already things are clearly strained between you; we just don’t want to see you lose sight of every other important thing.” 
	I breathed in slowly, thankful she had at least acknowledged what was happening between Tristan and me as important. Although why I needed her to believe whatever was there was real, while I continued to willfully deny every bit of concrete evidence was beyond me. I bit harder into my lip, letting her words float around me for a while before opening up completely to them and letting them settle concretely into me. 
	“You’re right about Seth,” I admitted, relaxing slowly into the truth. “He has definitely stirred up feelings I don’t think neither Tristan nor I were prepared to face. And I think they caught us both off guard. But please don’t worry, we both know what’s at stake and we aren’t willing to jeopardize the entire human race because of jealousy or curiosity or…. a mutual past. Plus, I value Tristan’s friendship way too much to hurt him or Seth.” 
	My mom smiled at me for a few moments, her sparkling blue eyes softening into relaxed ease. “Annabelle was exactly what we needed when you were a baby. Actually, she still is what you need half the time. Tristan and the entire Shields family came along with her into our lives and I have never once regretted the day that you and Tristan became friends. And even though I regret not treating your relationship with the caution and care that I probably should have, I will never regret the bond you two have developed after all of these years. Tristan is the reason we are here, the reason we fight a never-ending battle. Well, not just Tristan, but you know what I mean. Your job, your future…. your life, will never get easier, and never let you feel victory for very long. You need to remember why you gave up Heaven and an army to fight with, to protect this planet alone. And Tristan and Piper, Annabelle and everyone else that you’ve come to love along the way are like hundreds of lighthouses, sending out their beacons when the night is too dark for you to see straight or the Darkness swallows everything else around you whole. You will have those beacons of hope and love, of goodness and fragility to light your way, to remind you of why you will never give up this fight.” 
	I smiled at my mom when she finished. Her words had gone from piercing through me, to exposing those parts of my soul I thought I hid from everyone so well to comforting me and reminding me of everything I lived for. They soothed the open wound that was Tristan Shields and helped suture the raw vulnerability that made my heart feel as though it were torn in half. 
	With my mother’s reminder I could remember my purpose, remember that this life was not my own and that I served a greater purpose. 
	She walked over and gave me a kiss on the top of the head. “Stella, if you ever need to talk about…. this, I’m here for you baby girl. You can talk to me about anything.” 
	“I know mom, I will,” I promised. She left me, closing the door behind her. 
	With the click of the lock I sunk back onto my bed, my head flopping heavily onto my pillow. I felt suffocated and deflated; even if it helped that my mom had seen through my pathetic attempts to hide my feelings. I knew there was more to my life than an impossible relationship that didn’t even exist. 
	But even with that knowledge I knew I had a battle in front of me. 
	And this war I would have to wage would not be against the Darkness threatening to extinguish every last bit of light from this world. 
	It would be against my own treacherous heart. 

----
	
	The frantic beating of my heart and the inability to breath forced me awake, gasping for oxygen, somewhere in the emptiness of the night. I shot out of bed, slipping into sweatpants and tennis shoes before my brain registered what I was doing or why I was doing it. I pulled my head through a long-sleeved running shirt and burst through my bedroom door, my hands pulling my hair into a bun on the nape of my neck without my feet slowing down. 
	I was through the door and flying across empty, snow covered fields before I realized I probably should have warned my parents I was on a mission. The frozen landscape was a blur beneath me, and the cold air rushed around me, whooshing against my ears and assaulting my face, but it didn’t matter. Nothing mattered until I could reach my target. 
	Seth.
	His face reverberated through my brain in a panicked, heart stopping haze. I couldn’t say if I dreamt that he was in trouble, or simply woke up with the intuitive knowledge that he was in lethal danger. My instincts had kicked in, forcing me to act while my brain tried to catch up with what was happening.
	I arrived at the small farm Jupiter and Seth rented in less than a minute, having catapulted from my house to his in a blur of light that would have sent spectators calling the Department of Defense or the local news with reports of alien activity. The small, box of a ranch house was dark and silent, void of activity or obvious danger. I paused in the gravel drive, letting my body continue to drive my actions. I listened, I looked, I felt out for the evil I knew lurked close by. 
	The Darkness was heavy, weighing down the air around me, seeping into every molecule of oxygen, clutching the very air around me. I sucked in a breath, fighting through the suffocating and oppressive evil as it waged some silent war against Seth. I paused for only a second to confirm that he was in fact in danger before bursting through the dead-bolted door and letting my connection with Seth lead me directly to his room. My glowing body lit up the darkened house, casting my silhouette in exaggerated shadows on every wall. I shuddered at the distorted image of myself and forced my eyes to continue scanning every corner, ever hidden place trying to find the evil that meant my Counterpart harm. 
	Seth had jumped at my entrance, flipping over from his sleeping position on his stomach to stare up at me wide-eyed. I didn’t bother explaining my presence until I had sufficiently confirmed there was no one here, nothing lurking, nothing waging war…. just nothing. Seth had been sleeping peacefully, undisturbed and out of danger, and yet the clawing feeling at my neck refused to lighten. A chilling tingle rippled down my spine and I knew I hadn’t imagined the threat.
	Something was here.
	Or had been here….
	Or….
	I didn’t really know anymore. I let out a frustrated sigh and sat down heavily at the end of Seth’s bed.
	“Are you Ok?” I breathed, panting heavily from my effort to swoop in and save a perfectly fine, sleeping Angel. 
	“I’m fine,” he half-laughed. “Are you Ok?” He propped himself up on his elbows and his eyes swept over me before settling into mine with a burning gaze that seemed to see directly through me, straight to the clutching fear that was settling in my chest. What was wrong with me? Was I just overly paranoid?
	Or was I seriously losing my mind?
	“I don’t know,” I sighed, embarrassed of how shaken I still was. I let my eyes float over Seth’s perfect, chiseled face as he smiled adorably up at me. His amber eyes were glowing with comfortable affection, his hair tussled and mussed from sleep, curling at the ends more than usual. His skin was perfect, clear and golden all the way from his dimpled cheeks to his carved abs that stood out even in the darkness of the room. 
	Without realizing what I was doing, I brushed my hand gently along the lines of his abdominal muscles, letting the hardness of pure muscle tone flex beneath my fingers. I blushed into a deeper glow, removing my hand quickly and apologetically meeting Seth’s eyes. He stared back at me, more amused than ever, but there was something deeper behind his obvious entertainment, something I wasn’t quite ready to investigate yet.
	“Sorry,” I laughed, trying to lighten the sudden tension between us. “I was just making sure they were, uh, real.” 
	Seth smiled wider, disarming me with his fascinating, boyish grin. He sat up fully then, leaning forward and cupping my jaw with a calloused hand. “Stella, what are you doing here? Seriously, are you Ok?” 
	I wasn’t expecting the gentleness in his tone and felt my face heat beneath his hand, realizing he might actually start to believe I was as crazy as I felt. 
	“I had this dream…. I mean, I’m pretty sure it was a dream now that I think about it, even though I can’t really remember that much about it now….” I rambled, trying to distinguish what had exactly happened and what it was that made me rush over here. “To be honest, I don’t know what I’m doing here. I woke up and I just knew you were in trouble. I could feel you Seth, your agony, your fear…. And I could feel the Darkness here. What may have started as a dream…. a dream I can’t remember at all…. turned into real fear when I woke up and believed it was actually happening to you. I rushed over here, prepared to save your life when I got here. Except, when I got here, you weren’t being attacked by hordes of Shadow minions, you were just sleeping. But I felt it everywhere, I felt the Darkness everywhere, Seth. I was so scared, even when I got here. The air was so thick with evil…. I have honestly never been more scared in my life. I was positive you were in trouble. I mean, I was so sure.” I finished feeling exhausted and deflated. I just wanted everything to make sense. There were so many changes happening in my life, so many different things I needed to adjust to I didn’t really want to deal with being crazy right now.
	I just wanted to fight the Darkness- completely sane and with all my mental faculties absolutely intact.
	Why did that feel so impossible?
	“Oh, Stel,” Seth sighed sympathetically, pulling me into his arms. I leaned against him as he wrapped his strong arms around me and held me tightly against his chest. “So what you’re telling me is that all I have to do to get you into my bed at night is pretend to be in danger?” 
	I snapped my head up, not expecting his joke. He smiled down at me wickedly and in a way that let me know he was teasing so I slapped his bicep, pretending to be very offended. He just chuckled, dipping his head into the crook of my neck and holding me tighter. 
	“We are going to figure this out,” he whispered, his breath hot against my already heated skin. “You’re not crazy, and there’s nothing wrong with you so stop thinking those thoughts right now.”
	My shoulders trembled from the seriousness of his tone and I desperately tried to obey him. But how could I believe there was nothing wrong with me when the walls of my sanity seemed to continue to crumble.
	“Seth? Where are you?” Jupiter’s sharp voice called from somewhere else in the house. “Are you alright?” 
	“I’m in here, I’m fine,” he called back. He adjusted us on his bed so that I wasn’t curled completely into him and we were sitting side by side instead of me basically in his lap.
	I heard Jupiter making his way through the small house to Seth’s room, but got distracted when I noticed Seth reaching down to pull sweatpants over his bare calves and thighs and oh dear lord…. boxer briefs.
	I quickly turned my head, shielding my face with a hand over my eyes. Unfortunately Jupiter entered the room at the exact moment Seth was pulling his gray pants over his waist. 
	“Oh,” Jupiter grunted suddenly making this whole situation extremely awkward. “Uh, sorry, I didn’t mean to, uh…. I was just wondering what happened to the front door?”
	“This isn’t what it looks like!” I blurted, standing up and putting distance between Seth and me. “I was just worried about Seth and I needed to make sure he was Ok!” 
	“So worried you had to break my front door?” Jupiter accused, but his mercury eyes blazed with something I could almost define as humor for just a second before settling back to irritation.
	“She felt the Darkness again,” Seth explained solemnly. I wasn’t exactly prepared to share everything with Jupiter, although I knew that I should. Mostly I just wanted to forget this night ever happened. I should have stayed in bed where I belonged. 
	“You felt it here?” Jupiter questioned, his bushy eyebrows drawn together in concern making it look like he had a long, white, fuzzy caterpillar crawling across his forehead. “You mean with Seth?” Jupiter clarified and suddenly I didn’t feel so crazy or wrong, suddenly I felt like Jupiter might understand me. But he didn’t say anything more; he didn’t even attempt to alleviate my fears. He just continued to look between us.
	“Where are you coming from?” Seth broke the silence, noting Jupiter’s worn leather jacket and brown loafers that had tracked in snow. 
	“I met Serena and Nate earlier tonight, they were having issues down in Rio. They called for backup, and I decided to go and let you two rest,” he explained, his eyes flicking over the room as if continuing to search for the evil we had all decided wasn’t there to begin with. 
	“Thank you,” I offered politely and then clarified, “for letting us get a full night’s sleep. Or at least attempting it.”
	Jupiter grunted off my thanks and explained, “It was more for me. I haven’t been in a good fight in a while and was feeling antsy. I needed a solid workout.” 
	I nodded, not knowing how else to reply. I wasn’t at all surprised that Jupiter liked to get his hands dirty so to speak. I was actually more surprised that he reasoned it away by giving us a full night’s sleep. I really didn’t think he thought about those kinds of things. 
	“Did you fly here?” Jupiter asked gruffly and rather randomly.
	“Uh, yes.” I stammered, not sure if my truthful admission was about to get me into trouble. “I was in a hurry. Jupiter I really thought Seth was in big trouble, otherwise I wouldn’t have come. I’m sorry about your front door.” I finished meekly; realizing polite knocking would have been just as efficient tonight.
	“The door can be fixed,” Jupiter ignored my apology, waving it away with his hand. “Seth, why don’t you drive Stella home? We don’t want to draw any unnecessary attention. I’m sure her parents are worried about her by now anyway. I’m just assuming they don’t know where you are since they aren’t here with you.”
	I met Jupiter’s steely gaze and shook my head. “No, they were asleep when I left. They probably have no idea where I am.” 
	“If this happens again, Stella, your parents would be fantastic help. You need to bring them with you next time, not leave them home alone to worry about your safety,” Jupiter explained and I nodded my head slowly letting the realization that he was right sink in. I had no idea why I didn’t pause long enough to at least let my parents know where I was headed, let alone invite them to come along with me. Worst case scenario I could have taken off just a few minutes before they had and let them catch back up with me after I had engaged in the fight. 
	“Next time I will,” I promised, shaking my head wearily. 
	“Seth, go ahead, drive Stella home,” Jupiter suggested again. 
	I stood up and tried to straighten my posture, but my shoulders slumped in defeat. “Sorry to ruin your night with my crazy,” I offered, feeling on the verge of tears. 
	Jupiter caught my bicep in a firm grip as I moved toward where he stood in the doorway. “Nobody thinks you’re crazy, Stella. Something is going on, we don’t know what yet and it obviously doesn’t make sense. But something is going on and we will get to the bottom of it.” I gulped back the lump in my throat, hearing the solid tone to Jupiter’s confidence and conviction. His beliefs were rooted behind his words and it was hard to think less of myself when my weapons trainer held such faith in me.   
	“Thank you, Jupiter,” I answered meekly, the tears I had been trying to suppress flooding my eyes with gratitude. I blinked them quickly away knowing whatever respect I had garnered with Jupiter would be instantly and forever lost if I broke down in inconsolable tears in the middle of Seth’s bedroom for no reason at all.
	“Let’s get you back to bed,” Seth encouraged, placing a warm hand on the small of my back. 
	I turned into his touch, letting the heat of his strength comfort me. He led me outside and opened the truck door for me so I could climb in. I wanted to apologize again to him, but as he climbed in the cab and started the vehicle I decided I needed to stop apologizing and get better control of my emotions. 
	“Thanks for driving,” I offered instead. 
	“Stella,” Seth glanced at me seriously before turning his eyes back to the blackened country roads. “Promise me you will never stop investigating these feelings you’re having.” 
	“What do you mean?” I asked as Seth followed the gravel roads that traveled between his farm and mine. The frosted night glazed over the windshield with delicate snowflake patterns and our breath puffed around us in white clouds.
	“It could have been something tonight, I mean, even though it wasn’t…. it could have been,” Seth paused and gripped the steering wheel tighter. “Thank you for coming to my rescue.” 
	I cleared my throat, not trusting my voice with a response. Seth was so sincere, so genuine with his gratefulness that I was actually moved by it. I shook my head, trying to clear it of my over-emotional behavior tonight, but the “what if’s” kept running through my mind and I had to fear that Jupiter was right, that something was going on and we just hadn’t figured it out yet. 
	“And Stel?” Seth asked, a lightness returning to his tone. 
	“Yeah?” 
	“Anytime you need me to come check out your room in the middle of the night, I’m just a phone call away,” he turned to me with a sly smile on his lips and I immediately burst into laughter, thankful for his change in tone.
	“Oh, really? You’ll come look in my closet for monsters?” I flirted, still laughing at his brazenness.
	“Absolutely,” his grin grew into a wide smile and I stared back into those honey colored, heated eyes smiling just as big. “And under your bed…. under your covers…. wherever those monsters might be hiding.” 
	“I’ll keep that in mind,” I laughed.

Chapter Fifteen

	“Ok, so here’s the plan,” Piper exclaimed in between seventh and eighth period, “Since there are no basketball games tonight we’re going into Omaha to pick out dresses for the Valentine’s dance!”
	“Oh that sounds like fun!” I replied, shutting my locker and leaning against it. “Since we both have dates and all!” I smirked. This was the first dance Piper had ever allowed a boy to take her to, and I couldn’t stop teasing her about Lincoln, it was impossible. 
	“Actually all three of us have dates,” Piper explained in a quick rush of words I barely understood. 
	“Three?” I accused, rather than asked. 
	Piper stuck her head in her locker for a second before popping back out with a bright smile, “Well, me, you and Bree.” 
	“Are you kidding me?” I asked dryly, seriously reconsidering my evening. 
	“Come on, it will be so much fun! Plus it’s not like you have a whole lot of couture options in this ghost town…. and you desperately need my opinion.” Piper reminded me by gesturing around the crowded high school halls as if they were a good indication of the lack of shopping in Mead.
	“Fine, although Omaha doesn’t have many couture options either,” I grumbled, realizing the dance was two weeks away and I really didn’t have any options as far as dress shops went other than Omaha. And she was right about her opinion, I was helpless when it came to formal dresses and even if Seth and I were going only as friends, I definitely wanted to avoid looking like a bad eighties movie.
	“It will be fun!” Piper practically demanded, the strained edge to her voice daring me not to agree.
	“It will be fun,” I sighed, completely lacking the enthusiasm she was hoping for.
	“What will be fun?” Seth asked as he and Tristan joined us at the lockers. 
	“We’re going shopping tonight in Omaha, we need to pick up our dresses for the dance in a couple weeks,” I explained with a marginally better attitude. 
	“Oh, but I thought we were going to tr-“ Seth cut himself off, his cheeks heating with a soft glow at his almost announcement of our training with Jupiter that I had forgotten about. During basketball season almost every Friday and Saturday were scheduled with games, but this was an off week since our next game wasn’t until Tuesday. I had completely forgotten about the extra training Jupiter wanted to squeeze in this weekend.
	Oops.
	I needed to figure out Jupiter later though; right now I needed to do some quick damage control. 
	“Go on a date!” I finished for Seth, placing my hand over my eyes like I was embarrassed. “I completely forgot. Oh my gosh, Seth, I’m so sorry.” 
	“Yes our date,” Seth nodded, not covering as smoothly as I would have liked him to. “It’s Ok, there are other nights.” 
	I wanted to laugh at his obvious inability to act but had to remain stoic since Piper was glancing back and forth between us like she had missed the biggest headline of the year. 
	“Stella, I was just kidding about finding a dress, you can go on your date with Seth and you and I can find a different night to go into town,” Piper promised. 
	“Are you sure?” I double checked, realizing I could get out of making Jupiter mad and shopping with Bree. 
	“I have a better idea,” Tristan piped up, sounding enthusiastic but his eyes were narrowed just the tiniest bit sending warning bells resounding in my head. “Let’s all go into town tonight. Lincoln and I can show Seth the big city while you girls shop and then we’ll meet up for dinner and a movie after. It will be fun.” 
	Why did people keep trying to convince me tonight would be fun? It sounded more like a threat coming from Tristan and I wasn’t really sure how to get out of this one.
	“Seth is from Boston, Tristan, it’s not like he’s never been to a big city before,” I laughed nervously, trying unsuccessfully to get the subject dropped.
	“No, Tristan’s right! That does sound like fun!” Piper, for maybe the first time in her entire, stubborn, artistic life, agreed with the person she hated most. 
	My jaw dropped, my eyes bugged out of my head. I probably looked like a cartoon character holding a stick of lit dynamite. “Piper, what about this scenario makes you think that it would be fun?”
	“Fun” had just officially turned into a curse word.
	“What? You don’t want to hang out with your best friends and your boyfriend?” Tristan asked, his voice cutting like an accusation. “You’re the one constantly going on and on about how if we just spent more time together we would learn to like each other.” His pointer finger flicked back and forth between him and Piper who was nodding her head excitedly. 
	“Seth is not my boyfriend,” I explained too quickly and then forced myself to backtrack after noticing the confusion flash in Seth’s eyes. “I mean, we’re just going to the dance as friends.” 
	“And going on a date tonight,” Tristan reminded me callously. 
	“And going on a date tonight,” I echoed in a tiny voice. 
	“So it’s settled!” Piper squealed. “Triple date in the city!” 
	“How do you know Lincoln doesn’t already have plans?” I asked her pointedly, not really sure why I was still objecting to the outing.
	“Well, then I will just have to convince him he’d rather spend his night with me.”
“And how are you going to do that?” I bit back my laughter.
“With my womanly wiles, of course,” Piper purred conspiratorially and then bounced down the hall in search of Lincoln.
	“Piper is something else,” Seth chuckled as he watched her weave in and out of end of school traffic, her severe ponytail of dark hair bouncing enthusiastically behind her. “You’re Ok with tonight? You seemed like maybe you didn’t want to go,” Seth turned to me, his golden eyes squinting in concern.
	“Why wouldn’t she want to go?” Tristan asked from his position, leaning against my locker. “A night out with her two best friends and her boyfriend, come on Stel, what isn’t there to get excited about?”
	“Why do you do that?” Seth growled, his expression turning dark. “Why do you say ‘boyfriend’ like an insult?” 
	“Because you’re not really her boyfriend, are you?” Tristan stood up straighter, his shoulders pushed back and his hands clenched into fists at his sides.
	“Coincidentally, you’re not either,” Seth growled, adjusting to his full height, and cracking his neck forcefully to the side as if he were preparing for a fight.
	“I never said I was,” Tristan snapped back in a low voice.  
	“Tristan you are the one that keeps calling him my boyfriend, so knock it off,” I demanded, annoyed that Tristan was still upset over this. “And we were never going on a date tonight; we had training that I forgot about.” 
	“Oh,” Tristan backed down a little. Seth had too, although I could feel that the only reason he wasn’t working out his own version of training on Tristan’s face had something distinctly to do with me. “It doesn’t matter anyway, because you two basically are together. Which is fine with me, I just don’t know why you want to blow off your friends now that you’re so busy with him.”
	My mouth kind of hung awkwardly open for a moment while I tried to gather a rebuttal to his insane argument, but he cut me off before I could even start a stuttering response.
	“Never mind, I’m being a douche,” he ran a hand over his shaved head and glanced around the hallway impatiently. “I better find Bree before Piper takes all the credit for planning tonight.” He stalked down the hallway with my wide eyes following after him.
	“I’m sorry,” I sighed, leaning against Seth. I felt exhausted by Tristan. There were way too many emotions flooding my brain to make sense of and I hated that irritation and confusion seemed to overpower all the others. “I don’t know what his problem is.”
	“I think I can guess,” Seth mumbled before his eyes softened back into their natural friendly gold. “But anyway, are you Ok with all this? I mean going on a date and having your friends think we are together?” 
	“Sure, I mean, they were going to come up with their own assumptions anyway,” I replied lightly, and then I ignored the twisting in the pit of my stomach that shouted I was anything but Ok with this. I needed to be. I wanted to be…. but, well, this just wasn’t supposed to be how things worked out. High school was supposed to be mine. Destiny and fate and supernatural callings and all that other weird crap were supposed to happen later…. much later.
	“Stella?” Seth said my name softly, reverently and when I turned to face him it was like my entire being tuned into him. He stared down at me with the softest, gentlest expression, the hard lines of his face at extreme odds with the tender tilt of his eyes. My breath caught in my throat and I nodded in response because I couldn’t find words to answer. “We are just friends,” he promised, sincerity coating each word. “I know that this is weird…. this whole future between us. But we are just friends until there’s more and right now there just hasn’t been enough time for more to develop. Don’t let me freak you out, we do this in your time, nobody is pressuring you into anything, especially me.” He lifted his fingers to brush against my jaw, his rough, calloused skin against the soft, feminine skin of my face. I swallowed to fortify myself.
	“Thank you,” I whispered, feeling relief wash over me. I should have promised him I didn’t feel pressure, or that it wasn’t him that was freaking me out but the unknown part of our future relationship, but I couldn’t bring myself to utter those words. And if I was honest with myself, truly honest, part of my nervousness was Seth, his presence, his nearness, the way he stirred feelings and emotions that didn’t even make sense to me yet. 
	Yep, he definitely freaked me out.
	Except for right now.
	Because right now he was saying exactly what I needed to hear and in the hottest way possible.
	There were worse fates to have to come to terms with.
	“Ok,” I smiled brighter, forcing myself back to confidence. “We better go home and tell Jupiter that there’s been a change of plans. Do you think we can somehow convince him there is an attack on the city and they need our help?”
	“Probably not,” Seth laughed. “But we can for sure blame it on your friends and the fact that we have to keep our cover up.” 
	“I better let you do the talking,” I agreed, already nervous. 
	“Probably a good idea.” 

----

	I was still cringing in the dressing room as I struggled to reach the zipper of the floor length red ball gown Piper insisted I try on. Jupiter had not been happy that Seth and I were blowing off what in his mind was the training that would determine the entire future of the human race for dress shopping and bad chain-restaurant food. He had made us promise to double up sessions tomorrow, which drained my entire Saturday of anything fun and replaced it with sword movement repetitions and strength training.
	Ugh, strength training. 
	I flexed my velvety arms in the dressing room mirror and swallowed back the yelp of horror. Way too much muscle definition. It was one thing to be toned and fit. It was another thing entirely to look like I belonged in a body builder competition, wearing a skimpy bikini and a gallon of baby oil.
	Or was that too vain?
	“Let’s see it Stel!” Piper called from the other side of the door. I took one more minute to adjust the long sleeve, blood red velvet number she had demanded I try on. The sleeves swallowed my hands, opening up at the end in extra fabric that reminded me of something a witch would wear. The too big dress had enough fabric to spread out in a long train behind me and the color completely washed out my complexion. 
	I tromped out to the hallway, trying to suppress my laughter. Piper stood waiting for me, impatiently tapping her foot. She looked as equally ridiculous as I did in a white, chiffon ruffled disaster. The tight bodice fit her awkwardly and made her look like she had the chest of a little boy, while the ruffles tumbled in messy, gaudy waves from her waist to the floor and gave her the hips of a woman who had birthed at least twelve children. 
	“Are those feathers?” I burst into laughter at the realization Piper looked like a partially plucked chicken. 
	She gave me a stern glare and then burst into her own hysterical giggles. “You look like Valentine’s Day threw up on you!” she wheezed, clutching at her stomach.
	“I’m not coming out there if you two are just going to laugh at me!” Bree hollered from behind the fitting room door. “I already feel ridiculous enough!”
	“We promise not to laugh,” Piper swore stoically. She swatted my hand away as I tried to pull on one of her shredded, dilapidated feathers, poking out from where her belly button might be.
	A foreshadowing giggle escaped Piper as Bree opened the slatted wood door and stepped tenuously through the narrow doorway. Piper and I held our breath for three whole seconds before exploding in laughter, tears streaming from the corners of our eyes. We leaned on each other for support, sucking oxygen in through laughter that had become completely silent as it racked our bodies in hysteria. 
	Bree stood before us in a vintage, as in eighties, Pepto-Bismol pink taffeta gown, the sleeves ballooning into giant puffs that sat unevenly on her shoulder blades, the sweetheart neckline, dipping crassly into her cleavage, the skirt swallowed her body in folds of wrinkled fabric and the apron of lace both seemed to domesticate the outfit and tie the whole awful look together. Under her wounded scowl, Piper and I tried to pull ourselves together, but then she turned to get a better look at herself in the three fold mirror and her gigantic skirt swooped around and whipped Piper in the side. Piper took an exaggerated side step and we dissolved into more laughter, this time with Bree taking part. 
	“This was such a terrible idea,” Bree whined when we settled down and the sales clerk stopped to check on us twice, not understanding our sense of humor.
	“Sometimes you get lucky and find something amazing,” Piper defended her thrift-store idea, although she was still laughing so neither Bree nor I took her seriously. Suddenly she stood up straight and cocked her head to the side examining us all over again. “This could work….”
	“What could work?” I asked, feeling the flare of panic at the look in Piper’s eyes. 
	“This,” she gestured to the three of us. “We could splash black paint over all of the dresses and then wear like corsages with dead flowers in them as like a statement against the greeting-card holiday that defines the awfulness that is Valentine’s Day.” Piper proclaimed, growing passionate at the end of a speech that fell on Bree’s deaf ears and my vain ones. 
	“Absolutely not!” Bree shrieked, immediately trying to rip off her dress before Piper could pull out some hidden black paint to splash it on her. “Go right ahead and protest consumerism all you want, but I want to look pretty!”
	“Are you saying Piper wouldn’t look pretty covered in black paint, carrying dead flowers?” I gasped. “For the record, Pi, I think you look gorgeous in any color of death.”
	“I’m not worried about what will look good on Piper! I’m trying to get Tristan to notice me!” Bree lectured and I suddenly had to quell the unfurling of a very angry, desperate beast that seemed to take hold of my insides. I clutched against a stomach that was determined to be sick. A darkness settled on my shoulders, one that refused to let Bree claim what belonged to me, what I could never have but wanted ferociously anyway. I swallowed against the hole in my chest, the pit dug out by irrational jealousy. Tristan wasn’t mine. Could never be mine. 
	“Well, he’ll definitely notice you in that,” Piper gave her a suggestive look and we all burst into laughter. And just like that I found myself again.
	“Ladies, what is going on here?” the sales attendant poked her head in for the third time and we knew our fun was over. We offered apologetic smiles and ducked back into our separate fitting rooms to change back into the clothes we came in and the clothes we were thankfully leaving in. 
	Two hours later, shopping bags stored in the trunk of Piper’s parents Durango, we met back up with the guys at a city based pizza chain. We had ridden together into the city, since Piper’s SUV had three rows of seating and was big enough to hold us all, but we dropped the guys off earlier at an arcade to kill the time while we shopped. When we met back up at the restaurant all of them looked a little worse for wear and definitely on edge, even Lincoln. 
	We ordered at the counter, the boys respectfully paying, even Seth, and then went to the back to find a table big enough to fit us all. Unlike at our designated lunch table, where we sat definitively segregated, we mingled together here so we could sit by our dates. I was thankful the petty immaturity of Mead did not follow us into our Friday night. So we sat boy, girl, boy, girl around a large circular table.
	“Did you ladies get your dresses picked out?” Tristan asked, breaking what had turned into an uncomfortable silence.
	“Yes,” Piper sighed, sounding sorely disappointed.
	“Do you not like yours?” Lincoln asked quietly, picking up on her tone. She leaned into him, making him squirm just a little before he relaxed too and put his arm around her.
	“No, I like it, I mean…. I’m definitely going to look hot,” she bragged and I hid my smile behind my napkin. “It’s just I had this great idea for really sticking it to Valentine’s Day, but they didn’t want anything to do with it.” She pursed her lips and shot both Bree and I a look promising her future wrath.
	I giggled.
	“Piper, we loved your idea, seriously, it’s just that personally, I don’t have anything against Valentine’s Day,” Bree explained, giving Tristan a look that made me thankful I hadn’t eaten yet. 
	Tristan pretended not to notice.
	I giggled again. 
	He elbowed me in the ribs discretely. 
	“I thought you wanted to go to the dance?” Lincoln asked Piper in a quiet, shy voice. 
	She let out a long, exasperated sigh before admitting, “I’m a complicated woman.” 
	“That’s an understatement,” I laughed. She shot me another warning glare before tipping her head up to Lincoln and whispering something reassuring before kissing him.
	The rest of us averted our eyes as she made it clear to Lincoln just how excited she was to go to the dance. A little making out in front of your friends was Ok, but Piper was officially taking things into a situation where it was entirely and not at all annoyingly appropriate to yell “Get a room!”
	“She’s my best friend, but this is just getting awkward,” I mumbled to Tristan since Seth had politely engaged Bree into conversation over us.
	“No kidding,” Tristan laughed awkwardly. “Come on you two, before my eyes start bleeding.” Tristan threw a crumpled up napkin at them and successfully got their attention. Lincoln ducked his head, his cheeks blushed bright red and he avoided everyone’s eye. Piper however, sat proudly up in her chair, her face glowing with excitement. I was so happy for her I could burst.
	The pizza came and we all dove in. 
	“So what should we see tonight?” Tristan asked the table. “Zombies or aliens?” 
	“Is that all that’s out? How about we meet in the middle…. like a romantic comedy? Or just something that isn’t all about killing?” Bree argued, her distinct whine tingeing her every syllable while she batted her eyes flirtatiously at Tristan. 
	I was definitely going to need something that involved killing.
	“Let’s put it to a vote!” Piper declared democratically. She raised her hand to signal Lincoln be the first to share his opinion, and her bangles clanked down her wrist loudly.
	Tristan turned his head to mumble something to me, but his words were lost when a purely evil feeling slithered over my skin. I froze in my chair as the Darkness entered the pizza restaurant. Before I even lifted my head I instinctively felt that whatever presence joined us now was more incredibly evil than all of the Shadows I had fought put together. A cold terror settled in my stomach and spread through my veins like a sickness. The breath whooshed from my lungs and my fingers clenched against the table with a strength that promised to destroy my cover. The world around me narrowed into a darkened tunnel that sent my equilibrium reeling violently.
	Tristan looked down at me with panicked eyes, but I gathered my senses enough to shake my head slightly in warning. All at once my senses and instincts rushed back to me and I whipped my head toward a partially hidden, corner booth with the mission to extinguish whatever evil presence lingered in this world where it did not belong.
	My gaze shifted to Seth next. He sat rigid in his chair, his fists balled on the table, and his right knee bouncing up and down frantically. A wave of relief washed over me when I saw Seth’s reaction. I hadn’t realized how afraid I was until I saw how Seth was equally aware of the seething menace in the shadows. 
	“Earth to Stella!” Piper called. I looked up to see her arms waving at me while I stared seeing only the supernatural world around us. “Zombies or Aliens?”
	“Or love?” Bree squeaked.
	“Uh, definitely zombies,” I mumbled, my eyes flicking back over to the booth in the corner. I couldn’t see what sat there, what wickedness had entered this place, but I could feel how the entire atmosphere of the restaurant sagged under the weighted presence of such concentrated Darkness.
	“Zombies it is!” Tristan declared, standing up and clasping his hands together as if he just won some big bet.
	My stomach churned with anticipation for what was ahead of me tonight, and whatever it was did not include zombies, or outrageously buttered popcorn, but it was definitely akin to a horror movie. I turned to Seth, asking him silently with my eyes what we should do. 
	“I uh, I just got a text from my grandpa, I need to go make a call,” Seth explained super awkwardly before getting up to step outside. 
	He was so not good at lying, but it didn’t matter because at least he had a plan. Tristan’s eyes cut down to me, demanding I tell him what was going on. All I could do was offer a weak smile and pray that the battle didn’t start until Seth got back. 
	“Is everything Ok, Stel?” Piper asked, picking up on the weird tension. 
	“I don’t think so,” I confessed, knowing Seth and I needed to split up from our group as soon as possible. “I’m not sure.” 
	I let my eyes float back to the booth in the corner where they stopped abruptly on the most attractive, most evil man I had ever seen. He was slender and tall, wearing an extremely expensive charcoal suit and a winning smile that promised only terrible things. His golden brown hair was swept back from his eyes and he had a five o’clock shadow that could have easily seduced any woman. His piercing bright green gaze was locked on me from across the space between us and I felt myself sink back from the waves of pure malevolence that seeped from him. 
	“Stella Day?” he laughed from across the restaurant like we knew each other intimately. “Stella? Is that you?” 
	I swallowed down the fear, anger, and wrenching disgust and plastered on a hardly believable smile. “Oh, hey,” I forced myself to answer, instinctively realizing I needed to play along in order to protect my friends. 
	“Saul, look who’s here,” he turned his head to address his accomplice as he stood from their booth. Saul, was a huge, muscular man with jet black hair and black eyes as if when he fell from Heaven, the Darkness not only tainted his soul, but his features as well. 
	Saul didn’t say anything to his friend, just grunted in my direction. But then his eyes raked over me as if he knew every inch of me already. A mixture of nausea and excitement for battle rippled through me. I would enjoy making this particular brand of evil extinct.
	Seth walked back to the table at the exact moment I had decided to hell with the spectators and I was grateful for his reassuring presence. He put a hand on the small of my back and I felt his anger as his hand shook against me. He stared down the two Fallen who watched us with unmasked, cruel delight as if he too couldn’t wait for the privacy of the back alley.
	“That was my grandpa, Stella,” Seth growled, his voice low and vibrating. “I need to get home right away.” He turned his head at the last minute and addressed our table where everyone had fallen silent at the weirdness between us. “I’m sorry guys; you should get to the movie though.”
	“But how will you get home?” Tristan demanded, not at all fooled by Seth’s cover story. 
	“Do you two need a ride back to that sweet little farm town?” The first Fallen asked from across the room. His eyes lit up with anticipation, paralyzing me in his hungry gaze.
	I tried to pretend it was perfectly normal for two mysterious men to butt into a group of teenager’s conversation from across the room. And then prayed my friends wouldn’t start asking questions. 
	“We do,” Seth answered. “Were you headed that direction?” 
	“Well, we’ve been meaning to pay Jupiter a visit for a while now, haven’t we Saul?” the first Fallen asked, and a protective tremble shook my core. “If you would just call him and let him know we’ll take you home so he doesn’t worry, we’d love to offer you a ride.”
	“I can do that,” Seth replied robotically. 
	I tore my eyes from the Fallen’s gaze back to my friends. I was desperate to protect them, to save them from this horrendous evil. “Is that Ok with you guys? These are old friends of our families; we can get a ride home with them.” I forced my lips to twist into a smile and my eyes to meet Piper’s and Tristan’s. Piper looked concerned while Tristan looked…. like he was going to fight this battle for me.
	I needed to get them out of here.
	“Are you sure you’re going to be Ok?” Piper asked as Seth hung up the phone and smiled reassuringly.
	“Oh yeah, we go way back with these guys and my grandpa just told me how he cannot wait to see them again,” Seth promised, his voice sounding more controlled, but quietly scary.
	“And you guys should go, or you’re going to miss the previews!” I declared, standing up so that my chair scraped against the floor loudly. 
	I held my arms up, shooing them to the door where I said goodbye to Piper and Lincoln and politely nodded to Bree. Tristan stopped though, right inside the door where nobody else could hear him. 
	“Who are they, Stella?” he demanded, his voice barely a whisper. When I didn’t respond he filled in the blanks. “Bad guys?” 
	I nodded my head seriously, “Yep, bad guys.” 
	“I’m not leaving you,” Tristan promised and my throat immediately tightened and closed with the fear that he was serious.
	“Yes you are, Tristan,” I begged, my eyes meeting his and pleading with him to go. “They will hurt you if you stay, maybe even kill you…. probably even kill you and I cannot let that happen. Go with Piper, I’ll call you when I get home.”
	“No,” he growled, his arm slamming behind my head, pinning me against the wall. “I won’t leave you.” 
	I cupped his face with my hand and ran my thumb across his bottom lip, knowing that the evil I was going to face tonight was greater than anything I had met before. “You have to leave Tristan. I can’t worry about you while I face these guys, I won’t be at my strongest. And you need to get Piper and Lincoln out of here. You’re the only one that knows what’s going on and you need to get them somewhere safe.”
	“What if something happens to you,” his voice broke from frustration and I hated that he knew what was going on, for the first time in my life I hated that he knew what I was and what I had to face.
	“Nothing will happen to me,” I promised. “Nothing. Tristan I am the only hope this planet has, I am strong enough to defeat these guys, I swear to you. I’ll text you as soon as I’m on my way home.” 
	“This goes against everything I believe in, everything that’s in me,” his eyes held the deepest loss and even though I knew he believed I would win this fight, I also knew that it broke him not to be able to protect me. 
	“Please go,” I begged, my own soul feeling dangerously close to shattering.  
	A deep growl rumbled inside of him and he pushed forcefully away from the wall and stalked out the front door. I watched him walk away from the restaurant realizing that may have been the bravest thing he ever had to do. His eyes found mine one more time before he climbed in Piper’s Durango and I promised him again with my expression that I would be fine. His gaze hardened as if he knew I was lying to him and then he was in the car and gone.
	My shoulders fell in relief for just a moment before I turned back to face the men that followed Seth and I to the restaurant. Seth was watching Saul and the other Fallen, and I got the distinct impression he had yet to take his eyes off of them.
	“Well, should we take this carpool someplace a little more private?” The first Fallen asked, his voice mocking and amused.
	“I’m going to kill you tonight,” Seth snarled, his Adams apple bobbing in his throat with the effort to swallow.
	“Do you know these guys Seth?” I asked with feigned confidence as I searched their faces again wondering if I should know them too.
	“Sure, Stel,” Seth replied with a surprising tone of malicious disgust. “You remember when I told you about Aliah, don’t you?” 
	My gaze snapped back to the first Fallen that I could now identify as Aliah, the Angel that had betrayed and murdered Seth’s parents.

Chapter Sixteen

	Aliah. The name echoed back and forth in my head and turned my blood to ice in my veins. It was more than the tragedy of Seth’s parents, more than the pure wicked evil that seeped from every pore as he stood casually across the room from us; it was that his Darkness seduced me. 
	I wanted to ignore the fact that some part of me, some secret, hidden, horrible part of me was drawn to him. Something made me want to take steps toward him, to investigate exactly what was so enticing about him. But I swallowed the desire, the haunting craving of the darkest places that resided in my own soul.
	My father had told me every one of us were somehow drawn to the Darkness. Humans and Angels alike struggled to ignore a calling we didn’t understand and that would destroy us before we ever could. 
	That is all that Aliah represented: a once strong and good Warrior who had allowed his weakness and hunger to destroy everything that was pure in him. He was weaker than me because he had given in, he had surrendered. 
	I tilted my chin proudly and felt the slow crawl of heat flood my skin as the best part of me began to show. I could ignore the shameful thirst for the Darkness. And I could face Aliah. Both were predators and enemies. I would have to fight them both. 
	I was born to fight them both.
	“Shall we?” Aliah asked and gestured towards the door. Neither one of us moved for a while, not wanting to give up the ground of who walked out first. 
	“After you,” Seth smirked with a tilt of his head. 
	Aliah smiled patiently as if he were dealing with a small child and then eventually made the move for the door. Saul grunted behind him, but followed his lead. They walked out to the parking lot while Seth offered me his hand and we walked out together. 
	Aliah led us around to the side of the building that wasn’t exactly isolated, but it was shadowed in darkness. The tops of the buildings caged us in, blocked out the light from the night sky and the bright lights from the parking lot.
	We faced each other off, silent at first but I knew Aliah was waiting for something. Saul stood next to him, not any less evil, but somehow less intimidating. He gave off the vibe of a minion without much individual ambition. Not that I should have regarded him as less scary, I was sure he was capable of just as much damage as Aliah…. but Ok, anything standing in comparison to Aliah was going to be less scary. 
	He was simple, pure evil.
	“How good to see you Seth,” Aliah purred, his voice smooth and melodic as it sailed over his words. 
	“Don’t,” Seth growled. 
	“But it’s been so long,” Aliah antagonized, not losing the hypnotic tone to his voice. Saul grunted something that could be considered a laugh beside him. “The last time I saw you, you were just a wee little thing. But now look at you, full grown man with a chip on his shoulder. You are fairly intimidating, all brute strength and goodness and light.” Aliah snarled, his upper lip curling back over his teeth in an expression of hatred and mockery. 
	“Don’t forget the revenge he’s been storing up, waiting to unleash,” Saul threw in, barking his laughter. 
	I took Seth’s lead as he stood silent and listening, although I could feel the storm brewing beneath his skin, his anger and restraint pushed to its very limits as he waited for the right time. I swallowed roughly, taking strength from Seth but acknowledging that my own control was slipping. I needed to fight, needed it more than air at this point. My battle instincts flared to life and I was desperate to banish this evil that hovered much too close to everything I loved. 
	Besides that, this was a bit of an anomaly, standing in an alley, having a conversation with Fallen. Fallen rarely sought out Angels, usually they were simply hunted and remained in the unseen places to protect themselves. Aliah seeking us out said a lot about his confidence in himself and amusement in our abilities. Which made me want to prove him all the more wrong.
	“Why are you here?” I sighed as if annoyed by the whole evening.
	Aliah’s eyes flicked to mine and then narrowed into cruel slits of concentrated hatred. I forced myself to remain surefooted without taking a step back, although under the heat of his gaze all my body wanted to do was flinch away. 
	“Oh right, how forgetful of me,” Aliah murmured, his gaze softening. It wasn’t as though he looked at me with less hatred or malice, it was more like there was a purpose behind his words now that somehow altered the unfiltered line of loathing he had been pouring into me. “I got so caught up in reminiscing that I neglected to introduce myself.” 
	Sometimes when an Angel was old, like really old and had spent a significant amount of time in Heaven they would have an accent. It wasn’t a strong sound and didn’t affect words obviously, but the gentle strain to each syllable reminded the listener that English, or any Earthly language was not their first. Aliah had the accent, which made his betrayal, his conversion to the dark side much more tragic.  
	“I know who you are,” I said evenly, although his name and intimate knowledge of one of his assumingly long list of misdeeds hardly counted as anything.
	“But I don’t know who you are,” he spat, his features energized with the accusation. 
	I laughed in response. “Of course you do,” I sneered. “Isn’t that why you’re here?”	
	“For you?” his eyes followed every line and feature of my body from the top of my hairline to the tips of my toes and back up again, slowly, intimately. I willed myself not to shift under his hungry eyes, but I felt naked in his gaze, completely exposed and it was possibly the most uncomfortable I had ever felt in my entire life. I cleared my throat in a gesture to regain his attention but he was not someone easily affected by others. “Not today, Stella Day. I’m here for you,” his eyes fell to Seth and I had the instinctive urge to step in front of him, to shield him with my body and protect him from whatever Aliah was going to say.
	“That’s a good thing, Aliah, I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time,” Seth clipped his words carefully, making sure to enunciate everything. 
	“So you’re ready to come with me now?” Aliah asked, knowing full well that was not what Seth was implying. “It was unfair of me to ask you when you were so little, when you had so little experience. But now…. now you are a big strong man with the ability to make his own decisions. I’m giving you another opportunity. Give in to the whispers that have threaded themselves around your heart, give in to those desires that keep you up at night…. come with me. Join me.” 
	Aliah’s voice was like velvet, floating over every word, seducing the listener with his fluidity and promise. I waited for Seth to snap at him, to shout at him or attack him, but instead Seth shifted uncomfortably next to me, before simply shaking his head. It wasn’t the crushing verbal response I was hoping for, but the gesture seemed to provoke the same kind of concrete absolutism. 
	“You want to, Seth, why not just give in?” Aliah asked, prodding Seth’s patience. “If not for yourself then, how about Seven? She misses you, you know. She often asks about her little brother and wonders if he’s alright. Don’t you hate to disappoint your sister?” 
My mouth fell open at the mention of Seven.
Why I expected Aliah to play fair was beyond me, but still, bringing up the beloved sister that 
had betrayed your parents and left you to fend for yourself was a little harsh… 
	“Don’t say her name, don’t ever say her name,” Seth growled, his words low and so menacing I had to look at him to make sure it was still him speaking. 
	“Why? Is it too soon? The wound still fresh?” Aliah asked, humor returning to his voice.
	“Enough of this,” Seth warned. He stood perfectly still, no muscle moving, not even a tick in his jaw. His skin glowed brilliantly in the dark alley, but instead of comforting me this time, it almost frightened me with the intensity of his inner light. 
	Unlike Angels that still held goodness inside of them, Fallen shone with a different light, their inner goodness having been corrupted. Both Aliah and Saul emanated a dark light that was lighter than the night sky, but had to still be described as darkness. A grayish hue encompassed both of their figures, as if their evil essence seeped out from their skin and infected the innocent air around them. 
	“Tired of reminiscing already? We just started our walk down memory lane, let’s not give up yet. It might be healthy for you to work through your…. issues. Possibly come to terms with the nightmares? The dark, haunting thoughts….? Maybe even embrace them?” Aliah’s voice had turned sickly sweet and my stomach churned violently against his meaning. Was Seth really struggling against the Darkness?
	“Holy hell, you are such a conniving bastard!” The words and accusation slipped out before I could stop myself. Although I meant every word I said, it was definitely not Star-protocol to engage the enemy, especially when I was just calling them names.  	
To my surprise Seth let out a bark of laughter that rang scornfully in the air. 
“Well aren’t you something special?” Aliah’s expression had turned to something like surprise mixed with respect, which scared me more than any of his threats combined. 
“I’m tired of this conversation,” I scowled, drawing a short and thin but unquestionably deadly sword from the sheath strapped to my thigh. Skirts had definitely become part of my every day wardrobe now that I needed to carry weapons around. While maybe impractical for the actual battle portion of the evening, they still made access to weapons super easy. 
“Now, now let’s be reasonable,” Aliah patronized us patiently after Seth had quickly drawn his own sword from his back strap, hidden beneath his worn leather jacket. “We’re not here to fight, not yet anyway. We just want to talk to you. Besides you might want to wait until your cavalry arrives before you start pulling out the big guns, you kids aren’t quite up to speed to fight at this level just yet.” 
“We’ll be the judge of that,” Seth replied, and I could tell he was just as amused as Aliah was. I shook my head slowly at the two mortal enemies practically laughing their way through this confrontation.
Aliah’s white teeth glinted from across the alley and I watched his lips curl into a taunting snarl. “You’re not going to get your revenge tonight Seth, but it’s been so fun catching up. Let’s do it again soon.”
Saul barked a laugh next to him, and I began to wonder if the evil had made them deranged. This was the craziest, least productive conversation I’d ever had.
Before I could even contemplate the night too closely, the sky above our heads was lit with an incredible light that uncovered every space in the narrow alley. Saul shielded his eyes against the blinding brightness, but Aliah stared straight on, unblinking and unflinching. 
Seth and I never took our eyes off the two Fallen however, our training wouldn’t let us. I felt them as they landed around us, Serena and Nate, Jupiter, my parents. They had joined us, gotten here as fast as they could to fight this battle with us. I felt more than saw their surprise that we weren’t engaged in fighting yet, although I also knew they would be relieved. Fallen were difficult enemies to begin with, put it to test with our inexperience and young age, and the likelihood of victory had looked bleak. 
“Welcome ladies and gentlemen, how good of you to finally arrive,” Aliah held out his hands cavalierly, his smile turning to a seemingly genuine gesture. He was perfectly handsome, almost so much that it hurt to look at him. And even with the dark glow of evil casting dark shadows across his masculine features, he still seemed to retain some of the light from Heaven, as if once upon a time he had been so good and so pure that no matter the amount of Darkness poured into his soul, it would never erase the light he once lived in. 
The thought made me sick to my stomach.
“Aliah,” Serena hissed. I felt the Angels around me bristle at the sound of his name. “What would bring you out of the pits of Hell to grace us with your presence?” 
“Hell doesn’t hold me yet, Serena,” Aliah’s eyes narrowed angrily.
“It’s only your master then? Not yet your home?” Serena’s fiery antagonism punched through the night and my respect for her instantly grew in large amounts. I couldn’t deny the sinking, drowning feeling of fear I felt as Aliah reacted to her words, yet she stood behind me unflinching and proud. 
“I serve no master,” Aliah promised in a deathly calm voice. “That is why I chose this path, or don’t you remember? There is no authority to order me around or send me to my death. I am my own god.” 
“So Lucifer holds no authority over you?” Serena taunted. “The Elders must have lied to us as children then.”
“Enough,” Aliah snarled. “We are not here to fight you tonight. My only purpose was to reunite with an old friend and make a new one.” He gestured his hand towards Seth and then me. 
“You might not be here to fight tonight,” my father announced with the strong voice of an Angel Warrior, “but we are.”
“I wish I could oblige,” Aliah replied wistfully and then two things happened at once and so quickly I didn’t have time to react. 
The first was that I felt an evil presence surround us. My head whipped around to find the source, but nothing seemed out of place except for our group gathered in the alley. My eyes quickly fell to the Angels surrounding me but all other -eyes stayed forcefully glued on Aliah and Saul, no one seemed to notice anything else out of the ordinary. The presence was strong though, strong enough to send a chill shuddering over my body and the hairs on the back of my neck pricking painfully with fearful anticipation. 
The second thing that happened was when I turned my head back to warn the Warriors standing with me about a rear assault the words were taken from my mouth in a violent swoop. Aliah wrapped his arms around me and took off for the skies before I could even decipher what was happening. We flew upwards faster than I had ever dreamed of flying, eating up the space between Seth and those who had come to save us and wherever Aliah was planning on taking me. 
Saul kept pace for a few short seconds, just long enough to rip the sword out of my shocked hands before he took off in another direction. Aliah bound his hands and arms around me in a very familiar, caressing way, his hot breath irritated my neck as he held my body close to him in an iron tight grip. I felt violated and nauseous. His suffocating evil seeped into my skin, leaving a chilling paralysis. I struggled against him, but the harder I fought, the more Darkness he injected in to me. 
I let myself get kidnapped and now I was weaponless and in the mercy of the worst evil on Earth.
Awesome.
“You’re different than what I expected,” Aliah whispered indifferently in my ear. I shouldn’t have been able to hear him with the whipping, violent wind as we careened through the sky, but his words sunk into my skin and slithered over my body, grating themselves deep inside my bones. I would never forget this conversation, I knew that instinctively, it would haunt me for the rest of my life, however long that lasted.
“What did you expect?” I asked, simply to take my mind off where we were going and distract him while I concocted a plan. 
“A rigid, uptight bitch,” he laughed. I began to wonder if we had an actual destination as North America disappeared beneath us and I found myself somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean. “Don’t get me wrong, you definitely have that goody-goody Heaven’s minion side to you, but Stella there is something undeniably saucy about you.” He moved against me, his hands yanking me closer to him, and I had to swallow back the bile rising quickly in my throat. 
Instead of responding, I let my inner light heat quickly, hoping to blind him into letting me go. The warmth of my light fought against the icy, debilitating chill of his Darkness, warring inside me for life. Instead he just chuckled in my ear and held me closer, the sound was low and melodic. 
	“Relax Stella, I just want to give them a little scare, show them what I’m capable of. I’m not going to get Seth’s allegiance if I kill you off today, am I? But it was very important to let you all see what I’m capable of. This is a useless struggle on your part, but I do appreciate the hundred and ten percent effort.” Aliah reassured me soothingly, although there was hardly anything to be reassured about. 
	“He will never join you,” I shouted, loud and piercing, right in his ear. My voice was lost in the expanse of the sky. My limbs felt slow and sluggish as his Darkness worked itself through every vein and blood vessel, my breathing had become labored as my heart tried to pump against the frozen death taking hold of my body. 
	“We will see,” he laughed like the sinister villain that he was, the fear inside of me growing to dangerous levels. I knew this was death, no matter what he said, I knew this would end me. He pulled away from me, meeting my terrified gaze and looked at me, really looked at me. His brilliant green eyes seemed to read my very soul, his hands brushed at the wild hair that whipped around my face and then he let me go.
	I fell out of his arms completely disoriented and for a moment I was silent as the air rushed against my ears and the world gave way around me. There was nothing touching me except the angry wind that pushed against every limb of my body, the frozen temperature almost identical with the temperature inside my dying body. The ocean below had turned into a deadly platform rose to meet me and the night sky full of my compatriots faded away as instinct took over. 
	An angry, determined scream ripped through my lungs and in that desperate moment they shattered the ice that encapsulated them like glass broken into a million pieces. The blood in my veins stuttered for a beat and then pumped furiously against the evil death, my light burst forward and I lit up over the deep, dark Atlantic like a supernova. 
	Finally I was back to myself. I could breathe again. I could fly again.
	My shoes brushed against the isolated waves as I pushed upward and back into the sky where I belonged. I hovered for a moment, relishing in being alive, enjoying every easy breath and thankful that I could feel my light again. The loneliness and suffocating Darkness that existed without my essence was nothing I ever wanted to feel again. 
	Ever.
	Aliah was obviously going to have to die. 
	I took one more moment to be alone before I flew up into the cloud cover and burst forward toward home. 
	Not home.
	Toward Seth.
	I could feel him in the distance and everything revived inside of me demanded that I get to him. 
	I flew fast and furious through the night sky, the wind whipped against my face, the atmosphere determined to slow me down. I pressed forward, glowing with an intensity that would set every human scientist and most alien enthusiasts into fits about what I could possibly be. Protocol demanded I stay discrete, even in instances like this, but I couldn’t slow myself down or will myself to be careful.
	This was not supposed to be my life. This was not how Darkness and Light fought. For thousands of years the Fallen have hid from us, they’ve cowered in the dark places of planets and concocted their schemes and chaos in secret until there was nothing left of planets except to fight in the open. 
	Earth is not nearly on the verge of collapse. 
	And yet, why I am the one fighting on the defensive? 
	They should be trembling in fear of us. 
	I felt the anger and frustration at being violated, at being taken prisoner, furl and contract inside of me. A fierce, consuming hatred spread through me, like the Darkness only minutes before, eating up my veins, taking over my movements. Aliah had obvious, ill intent for Seth and no matter what my Counterpart was going through, I refused to let the Darkness win. Not this planet. Not Seth. 
	And then I saw him. 
	Seth.
	We met in the air, colliding into an embrace. His light warmed every inch of my skin, basking my face with the warmth of him. I sank into him, relieved and exhausted. He clutched me against his chest, burying his face in my neck.
	“I thought I lost you,” he breathed, his breath floating over my skin like a balm on an open wound. “I thought he took you from me.”
	“Never,” I croaked, choking on the confident ferociousness of my words. 
	“We should find your parents,” he offered responsibly but neither of us made any effort to leave each other’s arms.
	We hovered in the middle of a black sky, surrounded by clouds for a long time. Seth held me against his body so tightly it was almost crushing, but I needed the closeness. His closeness. There was a fear surging between us about what could have been and a deep, breathtaking relief that we still had each other. Our emotions were too intense to realize fully, too acute to move on from, and so we stayed, holding each other, knowing deep inside our beings that neither one of us would ever allow that to happen again. 
	Just when I decided my parents also deserved to know I was fine, they joined us. Nate, Serena, and Jupiter were there too, everyone glowing but Jupiter, who stayed back from the group, watching us cautiously. 
	“There you are,” my mother breathed as she yanked me from Seth’s arms and into her own. I felt her shivers of relief as she held me close. My father joined us, his strong, titanium arms wrapped around us both. 
	“I thought….” my father trailed off, not able to even finish his thought.
	“I’m here, I’m fine,” I assured them, giving them one more confident squeeze before pulling away. It was more of a show of assurance than an actual desire to be out of their embrace. 
	My eyes immediately went back to Seth, and his were there to meet mine. He held me anchored in the sky as his golden eyes refused to break our gaze. His arms were crossed against his chest and if anyone else would have noticed his pose it would have looked confident and intimidating, but I could see beyond that, see how he was still trying to hold himself together. 
	I wondered if the Elders had known what Seth would have to go through in order to protect this planet. I wondered if it was his past that made him eligible, and despite his seemingly fragile state right now, if it was that past that fueled a revenge so deep, a purpose so thick that his only option in this life was to succeed. Because as I took in his desperate eyes and clenched jaw, I knew without a shadow of a doubt there was nothing that would have kept Seth from finding me. 
	Nothing.
	“We should go,” Jupiter announced authoritatively, his voice cutting through a silent sky.
	“He’s right,” Nate agreed a little nervously. “All this light might have some adverse reaction on the marine life down there.”
	I looked down then, and realized we were still over the ocean. From up high I watched the white crests of the waves crash together in a volatile but vast, never ending struggle. The water was angry and troubled, anticipating a storm. And everything was black, except for the very tips of the high waves, the foam that bubbled and simmered and then was forced under as another big upsurge of water washed over its top. 
	Seth took my hand in his and we moved as one unit, with our lights dimmed, back toward home. But I couldn’t take my eyes off the water. As we flew over the last of the Atlantic, my eyes never left the small bits of white that were drowned over and over by the black waves. As the brewing storm electrified the atmosphere, I had to wonder if we were fighting the same battle…. If our light was as little as the bits of foam on the top of each wave, only visible for a moment before being drowned into the deep abyss of the dark sea. 
	Were we also on the verge of a storm?

Chapter Seventeen

	“Don’t let them pull you into an all-night discussion,” Seth whispered once we were back on the solid gravel ground of my driveway. “You deserve to go to bed.” He put his hand on the small of my back, ushering me inside. He tried to get me up the stairs but I think Jupiter caught on to what he was trying to do.
	“We need to talk about what happened,” Jupiter called in his rough, domineering voice. “Stella, we need to hear what was said and what exactly happened.”
	I turned around, fully willing to oblige. I knew they needed to hear what was said and what Aliah wanted. Seth needed our protection, not me. I shuddered involuntarily, not even allowing myself to think of what could and would happen to Seth if Aliah managed to succeed. 
	“Not tonight,” Seth answered before I could open my mouth to agree with Jupiter. “We’ve all been through a lot tonight, Stella more than the rest of us. Let her rest. We can talk about this tomorrow.” 
	Jupiter demanded respect and obedience. I was positive even humans would recognize there was something about him that forced everyone to listen closer and pay better attention when he asked for it. And Seth was usually so laid back that sometimes I didn’t even know if he was serious or not. But I would never second guess him again. His voice had hardened, demanding unquestioned acceptance. He was in command now, he was calling the shots. His hand pressed firmly against my back, the heat from his skin blazing an imprint through my shirt. His body was taut next to me, completely called to attention. 
	Everyone turned their attention to us, me with one foot on the servant’s staircase ready to go up to my room or back to the kitchen table, depending on whose authority won out; and Seth, his body half in front of me, his arm tightly wound around my waist. A flood of warmth rushed through me, completely unrelated to my inner light, as I recognized again the depth of his defense and protectiveness when it came to me. Part of it was an ability he was born with, and the other part, the part that wrapped itself around my heart in a tight, stronghold of adoration, was purely him, purely his desire to guard me against every kind of evil out there, even late night discussions when all I really wanted to do was crawl under my warm covers and not surface again until the bright light of day. 
	Jupiter eyed him carefully, his red eyes narrowed in a scrutinizing stare. He looked like he wanted to argue with Seth, but instead he deferred the final decision to my father with an abrupt lift of his chin. 
	“Stella, is there anything we have to know tonight?” my dad asked tiredly. Everyone in the room seemed acutely aware of just how tightly strung Seth was at this point.
	“Nothing that can’t wait until dawn,” I whispered, my throat raw with the effort. So many emotions and fears were twisting inside me; I wasn’t even sure what I would tell them in the morning. I knew I had more questions than answers though. Did they know Aliah from before? Did they know how evil he was now? What he was capable of now? Did they even know this depth of depravity existed? Did they know he stripped me of every confident thought and action I had ever accomplished and left me exposed, bare and vulnerable? Did they know I wasn’t enough now, and maybe never would be? 
	Did they know this planet would fall just like all the rest of them? 
	And that I was helpless to stop it from happening? 
	“Don’t.” Seth commanded, his low voice a growl in my ear. “Whatever you’re thinking, don’t. Let’s get you to bed.” 
	I shook my head and tried to clear it of those awful, paralyzing thoughts and realized I started to tremble. I refocused my eyes and turned around so that Seth could lead me up the stairs and to my room. Each step felt painful and took effort. Each movement of my body was forced and struggled for. 
	I was exhausted. But I was more than anything disturbed deeply by what happened tonight. More than the fear of my almost death was the realization that Aliah could have done anything to me and I wouldn’t have been able to stop him. Besides the number of sins he was capable of committing against me, it was more that I was weak and helpless in his grasp. He had debilitated me before I could even wrap my head around what was happening and he had forced his Darkness into me while only embers of my abilities flickered against his all-consuming power.
	He was so much more than I could ever have imagined facing.
	So much more evil than I ever believed existed.
	Or ever wanted to believe existed. 
	Seth opened my bedroom door and turned on the bedside lamp so that the room was illuminated by a soft, warm glow of light. I stepped inside my room feeling like I didn’t belong here anymore. This was the room of a naïve, sheltered child and I came home tonight as a wide-eyed, inadequate failure. 
	This room was for those who believed they were still safe.
	I wasn’t safe.
	“Come to me,” Seth demanded. 
And I obeyed. 
	He was leaning against the closed door; his shoulders were still painfully tight, his light still shimmering around him. His eyes were a perfect color of honey that was deepened with his intensity. He reached out a hand to me, a strong, calloused, perfect hand and I took it so that he could pull me into him and crush me against him again.
	I didn’t feel safe anymore. All of my disillusions had disappeared. 
	Except in Seth’s arms. Here, against his chest, with the beat of his heart pounding against my cheek and his protective arms shielding me from every dark thing in this world…. here I felt safe. 
	“Whatever you are feeling…. whatever you are thinking…. it’s not your fault,” Seth promised, his voice so thick with emotion that it made my chest constrict until I had to force myself to breathe again.
	“It’s not yours either,” I whispered. His breath hitched in response and he clutched me impossibly closer. “Seth, he wants you,” I tried to hide the agonizing fear that laced each of my thoughts with despair, but it was useless. The fear seeped in, infected everything inside of me and left me empty of hope.
	“He won’t get me,” Seth answered simply and I was surprised by the simplicity of his confidence. “I’ve lived the last eight years knowing two things for certain. One that the Darkness, in whatever form it takes, is actively hunting each and every living, breathing, good thing that exists in this universe. There are levels of denial and safety and naivety, but the Darkness wants us all. And it will stop at nothing until it either has us all or it’s destroyed. And the second thing I know is that at some level…. we all want it to capture us.” 
	I stopped breathing completely at his words. I was scared into reality tonight. But Seth lived with a level of pain and struggling that I couldn’t even begin to comprehend, not at any level. And as easy as it would be for me to believe him, especially after tonight…. I had to believe there was an in between the pain of his path and the reality of the world we lived in.     
	“We fight two battles, Stella,” he continued and now I knew he was right. “One against the Darkness that threatens everything we know and love. And another against ourselves and what we would destroy should we give into the Darkness and end it all ourselves.” 
	We stayed like that for a few more minutes, before he slipped a finger under my chin and tilted my face upward to look at him. He leaned down into me and despite tonight’s events the room swam in my peripheral vision. His face was the only thing I could see clearly, his piercing eyes, his chiseled jawline, his full, wet lips. 
	I felt my own lips tremble just before they met his with soft, yielding pressure. He kissed me sweetly, gently and I had never felt more delicate but protected in my entire life. The kiss, my first kiss ever, only lasted for a few seconds, but it was enough to change me, rearrange the most secret places of me, and forever move some pieces of me that would never go back to being the same. 
	In the sweetness of his gesture I felt every fear and insecurity he had and held for me, but I also felt the depth of his emotion, the hope he had for us and in the undiscovered future neither one of us fully realized yet. He was so much more than the Angel I met just over a month ago, so much more important to every fiber of my life. 
	“Get some sleep, Stella, everything will feel less heavy in the morning,” he smiled down at me, disarming me with his perfect, easy grace. 
	“Promise?” I asked in a small voice.
	“Promise,” he said finally and then released me. He left my room and suddenly the space around me felt ginormous and coldly empty. 
	I changed into fresh pajamas and lay down in my bed with thousands of thoughts swirling around in my head. I couldn’t bring myself to turn off the lamp, especially with Seth gone. I listened for a while to the conversation that continued after Seth returned downstairs, but eventually the voices quieted and then disappeared completely, although I was almost positive no one left our house. 
I willed myself to shut down and go to sleep but there was too much going on inside of me, too much had happened tonight.
	I wouldn’t allow myself to think on Aliah directly, or dwell on what could have happened tonight. The memories and insecurities snapped through my thoughts like a disjointed, half-distorted slide show on repeat. I knew if I tried to dissect what went wrong I would only be swallowed up by the feeling of failure. 
	Vulnerable.
	That’s the emotion that kept trying to choke me.
	And vulnerable in the worst way possible…. in the way that ended with a quick slice of a sword blade and my head rolling off my body in a hollowed out thump on the ground.
	A violent shudder rippled through me.
	Pull it together. 
	And I was almost there, almost whole again when a soft, but stern tapping on my window had my heart in my throat desperately trying to pound a hole in my trachea. I sat up straight in bed, wild-eyed and so disturbingly paranoid it was painful. My breathing was labored and fast and my hands began to shake as I went for my katana hidden under my mattress. I felt like an unstable burst of light vibrating uncontrollably, waiting to be unleashed against the planet.
	And then Tristan’s shaved head appeared beyond the glass and I fought quickly to find my sanity. He watched me come back to myself through the window pane, his hands rubbing over his head roughly. I carefully set the sword down on my night stand, and collected myself before throwing off the blanket and walking to the window.
	“What are you doing here?” I asked out of breath. “You scared me to death!”
	“I’m sorry,” Tristan mumbled. I could tell he felt bad for frightening me, and then I saw the emotion in his forest green eyes. “I was just worried.” 
	“Oh my gosh, Tristan, I should have called,” I cried, as I pulled him in through my open window and threw myself in his arms. “It’s been a crazy night.” 
	I nuzzled my face against his neck and let his arms circle around me. This was a different kind of comfort than Seth. Tristan was absolutely safe because there was no immediate danger with him, he wouldn’t face the Darkness head on and risk his life, he wouldn’t be hunted by the worst kind of evil on planet. He was sheltered from all of that. 
	And yet his arms didn’t feel like I was lying to myself, or sheltering my own fears from reality. I felt the legitimate safety that came when someone cared about you more than themself. Tristan would fight whatever evil faced him to protect me. I knew that in my heart of hearts.
	So I let his strong arms pull me to him and the excitement his closeness brought lessen the demons that haunted me. 
	“Are you Ok, Stella?” He asked against my bedhead hair. 
	“I am now,” I breathed, pushing up on my tiptoes, so I could hold him tighter around his neck.
	“What happened tonight?” he asked and I noticed the careful tone he used. He was afraid I wouldn’t tell him. 
	Or maybe he was afraid I would. 
	I pulled away and led him to my bed. We sat down, keeping our closeness, my hands slipping into his immediately. He sighed next to me, and I debated whether or not to tell him the truth. Part of me wanted to protect him from having to carry that kind of scary reality and the other part, the part that would win, just wanted avoid having secrets between us. 
I rested my head on his shoulder, nuzzling against it until I found a soft spot around all of his
sharp bones. “Seth and I…. those were some really bad men at the pizza restaurant…. like really bad.”
	“I thought you didn’t fight men?” Tristan asked, his voice vibrating with anger at events that weren’t even revealed to him yet.
	“No, I don’t. Sorry, these guys at least look like men. I mean, they’re like me. They were Fallen. That was Aliah and one of his henchmen. He’s pretty much the worst of the worst,” I explained meekly.
	“And you fought him tonight?” Tristan growled.
	“No, not really,” I admitted. “There wasn’t actually any fighting tonight. He…. he pretty much proved who was the stronger Warrior and it was definitely not me,” I laughed humorlessly.
	“But you’re Ok?” 
	“He let me go…. he could have killed me, but he let me go.”
	“Why?” Tristan choked, and I could tell he wasn’t sure if he wanted to hear the answer.
	“I’m not sure. But I do know he will never let me go again. This time was a warning, he was proving his dominance. I won’t be so lucky next time,” I whispered.
	Tristan pulled me to him again, gratitude for my safety radiating from him. I breathed him in, savoring this moment, especially now that I knew how quickly it could have been ripped from me. I felt Tristan still beside me, his body tensed and aggressive. He pulled away for a moment and opened his mouth. I knew he wanted to ask more questions, or say something…. or I don’t really know what. But he stared at me for several seconds until he pulled me back to him without saying anything.	
	He lay back on the bed, pulling me with him and into the nook of his arm. I cuddled closer, so thankful that he came tonight and was willing to just hold me. My eyes fluttered closed, my tangle of thoughts quieted. With Tristan so near I couldn’t keep them open anymore. I was drained, physically and emotionally. And I finally felt safe again. 
	I took one more big breath, inhaling Tristan, his clean, masculine scent that belonged only to him and let sleep finally take me away.

----

   	“Hello?” I grumbled after picking up my phone without even looking to see who called. My voice was scratchy and raw, fresh from a good five hours of sleep. I tried to sit up in bed but an arm tightened around my waist, pulling me back down into warm, muscly arms. 
	“Good morning!” Piper chirped, sounding like an over excited bird this early in the morning. 
	“Piper?” I croaked, confused and disoriented. My voice did not get any better. 
	I looked down at Tristan who was still cuddled against me, his face so sweet and soft with sleep. His jawline had some overnight growth on it that I desperately wanted to run the palm of my hand against. He was so peaceful, so comfortable that I found myself just staring at him. 
	“What happened to you last night? Are you and Seth Ok?” She demanded, her voice losing the Disney-princess-sweetness she had woken me up with.
	“Yeah, we’re fine,” I answered and hoped my morning voice disguised the fearful hitch. “Those guys were just friends of Seth’s grandpa.” 
	“Oh. Because they were seriously scary. Seth’s grandpa isn’t in the mob or anything is he? Maybe like a retired hit man?” Piper joked, but sounded half serious.
	I forced myself to laugh. “Yeah right, that’s why Seth transferred here. He and his grandpa were put in witness protection.”	
“Well you never know. Seth is so mysterious; he’s got to be hiding something,” Piper exclaimed dramatically.
	“Pi, it’s not the mob. Trust me. My parents have known his grandpa their entire lives. Do Micah and Celina honestly look like they would know anyone with mob ties?”
	“You never know,” she countered. “They don’t seem like they would run around with criminals…. But then again they don’t really seem like the kind of people to hang out with hillbillies either, so maybe you’re whole life is a lie. Maybe you’re in witness protection too and you just don’t know it!” 
	“That sounds about right,” I groaned. I finally sat up and smiled when Tristan shifted to curl his body around mine. “Is this why you called? You were worried my parents got the shake down?” 
	“Shake down? I don’t think you used that correctly,” Piper laughed loudly in the phone. 
	“It’s all part of my witness protection act. First I misuse mob terminology to throw you off track, next I turn all CI on you and the DA is suddenly knocking at your door with a warrant,” I laughed.
	“No more TNT dramas for you!” Piper demanded in between gasps for air as she laughed at me. “I’m taking away all basic cable privileges!”
	“So Tristan’s a total douche,” Piper declared after our laughter had died down. I looked down at his sleeping form next to me and highly doubted that. 
	“What now?” I sighed. I couldn’t stop myself from brushing my fingers against his jawline, feeling the rough hair against the pads of my fingers. He let out a quiet sigh and pulled me tighter against his chest. 
	“He totally ruined the night after we left you guys last night. Bree was so excited to go on a date with him, but as soon as you and Seth left he just moped around and wouldn’t even talk to her. We dropped him off as soon as the movie was over, but then Bree was in a bad mood so then I felt bad…. She asked me to stay the night with her, and I couldn’t say no, especially after how Tristan treated her, so then my night with Lincoln was ruined.” Piper huffed angrily and I wanted to feel bad, or at least feel kind of bad for Bree, but I couldn’t help the happy little dance my heart did knowing that Tristan moped around after I left…. even if it was because he knew I was in mortal danger and for no other reason.
	“He is just the most aggravating person ever!” Piper continued and for a minute I had no idea who she was talking about so I just listened. “It’s just like, we don’t want to sit here and arrange our lives around the fact that he won’t go after what he wants. You know? Maybe he doesn’t want to ruin the friendship, or I don’t know what the hell is wrong with him, maybe he’s just afraid, but you don’t deserve to be strung along. And Bree especially doesn’t deserve it.”
	It took me a minute to get my head around what Piper was saying, and that she was defending Bree more than she was defending me until I realized what she was saying. But when then light bulb clicked I knew I needed to control the damage.
	“Piper, Tristan doesn’t like me,” I said adamantly and then regretted it immediately when he stirred next to me. 
	“Please don’t play this game with me, I had to listen to Bree talk about herself for eight hours straight. I’m not kidding, the girl talks in her sleep and she dreams about herself! I can’t take anymore self-denial this morning,” Piper whined.
	“Pi, I’m not in denial. Tristan and I have only ever been friends…. that’s all we can be otherwise the world just might explode,” I sighed and hated how sad I sounded. I looked down and Tristan was looking up at me, some emotion so volatile in his eyes that I couldn’t even distinguish it. “You know this better than anyone.”
	Only she didn’t know it better than Tristan and I or that the world might actually explode.
	“And I’ve always been fine with the whole destined-to-just-be-friends thing. That is until Tristan started ruining my dates with his big ol’ pining heart. I can’t take it anymore. Can’t you just make out with him so you both realize it would be like kissing your sibling and we can all go back to normal again?” Piper argued. 
	I looked down at Tristan who smiled a little at Piper’s comment. She was talking so loud he could hear everything she was saying. He slid his hands under his head and looked up at me with an eager expression, waggling his eyebrows. My eyes flickered down to his lips and I nearly forgot how to breathe. 
	“That is not going to happen, Pi,” but even I didn’t believe my overly breathy voice.
	“Whatever,” she grumbled. “Just, next time you see him tell him he better get his crap together and stop emotionally tormenting my best friend or I’m going to castrate him.”
	“I’m sure Bree is just fine,” I groaned.
	“I’m not talking about Bree,” Piper sighed sadly. 
	“Bye, Pi,” I said absentmindedly, still transfixed in Tristan’s naughty gaze. His expression was so cocky and suggestive, that I suddenly felt I was being pulled into very dangerous territory. 
	“Bye, Stel,” she mumbled, but I was already clicking off the phone.
	“What did Piper have to say?” Tristan asked in a deep, rumbly voice that sent common sense far, far, far away.
	“She said to stop leading Bree on,” I paraphrased. Tristan found that amusing, his lips twisting into a smirk. 
	“Mmm… Is that all she said?” he asked. Suddenly he grabbed me around the waist and flipped me onto my back effortlessly so that he hovered over me. His green eyes flashed a deep forest green and when he licked his lips nervously I knew I was in trouble.
	Still I couldn’t bring myself to move from underneath him. 
	“Oh, she said something about how you and I should just go ahead and make out so we realize it would be like kissing our sibling,” I said casually, tearing my eyes away from his to look away and pretend like it was no big deal.
	“Maybe she’s right,” Tristan mumbled, pressing his body down to mine and nuzzling my ear with his nose. A gasp escaped my lips before I could stop it and my eyes fluttered closed without my permission. “Do you think kissing me would be like kissing your brother?” His voice was a hoarse whisper of desire and I found myself struggling to remember how to make words come out of my mouth.
	I shook my head, turning my face back to his. He looked at me for a moment more, making a decision somewhere in the soul of his being that would forever alter the course of my life. 
	That would shatter me. 
	His lips were just a breath away from mine. My mouth parted just the tiniest bit, and Tristan moved into me just a fraction of an inch more. I felt his tongue sweep across my bottom lip and I quivered from the contact, my breath hitching with anticipation. 
	“Stella, honey?” My mom called from the hallway and the realization that I was about to be in huge trouble hit me hard. I snapped back to reality but it was too late to push Tristan away. My mom pushed the door open and announced, “Stella, Jupiter’s wait-“
	Tristan shot up off me, his eyes darting around the room looking everywhere but at my mother who stood in the doorway with her mouth dropped open. 
	“Morning, mom,” I squeaked. Her eyes shot back and forth between Tristan and me and I instinctively knew I was about to be grounded for the first time in my life. 
	“Good morning, Stella,” her tone turned deadly serious and her honey colored eyes sharpened to stone. “Good morning, Tristan. It’s awfully early to be paying Stella a visit, don’t you think?” 
	“Um, yes ma’am,” Tristan stuttered, his eyes falling on the window as a dead giveaway. I groaned. “I should uh, get back home anyway…. I have chores.” 
	“Then yes, please get back to your chores,” my mother demanded, each constant clipped.
	Tristan moved to the window, in a hurry to get away from my mother. She realized what he was doing and her entire body snapped rigid with anger. “The door Tristan! Use the door!”
	“Oh right,” Tristan blushed. He turned to me, before he made it all the way across the room. “Bye Stel-“
	“Goodbye Tristan!” my mom cut him off before he could finish and he ducked around her like a puppy with his tail between his knees on his way out. 
	Yep, she defended the galaxy. She was kind of scary.
	“Tristan!” I heard my dad exclaim from the kitchen. “What are you doing here?”
	“Uh, just leaving,” Tristan barely replied and I heard the kitchen door open. “Bye Mr. Day.”
	I shot out of bed, pulling on a sweatshirt over my running tank top and throwing my hair into a tight pony tail on the top of my head. I slipped into some snow boots that didn’t actually go with my athletic outfit, but were necessary for the day of training I face and grabbed my katana that still sat on the bedside table. My mom stood in the doorway watching every single one of my movements, her arms crossed and her foot tapping frantically on the wood floor. 
	“Does he sleep over often?” my mother seethed, struggling for calm. 
	“No, mom, I swear, it was the first and only time. He just came over to see if I was alright! We were hanging out with him and Piper before Aliah showed up and he could tell something was wrong. We fell asleep, it was innocent, I promise,” I begged her to understand, to believe that nothing happened.
	Because nothing did happen.  
	The disappointment that was dragging my heart into the pit of my stomach reminded me exactly how much didn’t happen.
	My mother’s eyes scrutinized my entire face while I struggled to hold my gaze up to hers. I really didn’t have anything to hide. 
	“We will talk to your father about this after training, Stella. Don’t keep Jupiter waiting any longer,” she demanded and I obeyed.
	I bounded down the stairs and into the kitchen. My father was still staring at the door over his newspaper as if he still couldn’t believe Tristan just left his house. I almost laughed at his incredulous expression until I noticed Seth standing at the kitchen sink in the same kind of shock. 
	Crap.
	He looked up at me and our eyes met but I immediately wished they hadn’t. Seth looked hurt…. no worse than hurt. 
	Seth looked betrayed.

Chapter Eighteen

	Training was brutal. Not only did Jupiter refuse to let me start with a weapon, but he was a relentless drill sergeant that shouted his orders like I was experiencing my first day of boot camp. And like I had no feelings. I wanted to suggest to Jupiter that reminding me of how close I came to failure was not a motivational factor in my life, but I feared that would only egg him on. And in truth he was pissing me off.
	And then there was Seth.
	Seth….
	Seth was definitely taking out some anger and pent up aggression on me. 
	“You’re dead,” he announced as I lay on my back with his sword at my throat. He stood over me inserting all kinds of male dominance and a low growl escaped me before I could stop it. “Get up,” he ordered.  
	I grunted a reply without making an effort to move. I was pretty sure the ground was so frozen and my fall so hard that I left a permanent Stella-shaped indentation in the earth. Seth pulled his pirate sword back to his side and then offered me his hand. I took it and he pulled me swiftly to my feet, depositing me in a standing position so that I was ready to go again. His eyes cut away from me, and he shrugged his shoulders getting ready to attack again.
	Ugh.
	“Get rid of your weapon,” Jupiter called from across the field. “And this time try not to die!” 
	I tossed my sword like a javelin into a snow bank on the opposite side of the open field and closed my eyes to center myself. Seth wasted no time and before I could even inhale an entire breath I had to duck out of the way from a brutal swing of his sword. I stood up straight ready to run toward my weapon, but had to leap into a back flip instead. 
	Before I started actively fighting, I used to watch action movies and laugh at the theatrics of some super heroes. I never believed there was an actual, real life moment when a back flip would be essential to one’s survival. 
	Until today.
	A back flip just saved me from the wrath of Seth.
	“Are you trying to kill me?” I shouted as I jumped to the side, avoiding another sword slice. He caught my sweatshirt, ripping a huge hole in it as he plunged his sword deep and withdrew. I let out a frustrated scream. I liked that sweatshirt!
	“Just making sure you’re prepared,” Seth panted with a twisted, cruel curve to his usually charming smile. 
	He continued to attack as I moved in the general direction of my weapon, keeping my eyes focused on him the entire time. I desperately wanted to watch his sword; my eyes betrayed me in the way they naturally sought out the sharp tip plunging toward me. I forced myself to keep my eyes trained on his body, the direction his hips and shoulders were pointed, the place where his eyes fell, gave away his own moves just a fraction of a second before his weapon would follow. 
	“I get your point,” I grunted, jumping high off the ground as he swung his cutlass toward my feet, hoping to unbalance me. It was how he won the last skirmish and I wasn’t going to fall for the same trick twice. 
	“And what point is that?” He half grunted, half shouted with the effort to continue to attack.
	“I messed up,” I tried to whisper so Jupiter couldn’t hear us, but I was practically running for my life, even if it was just a training exercise and I was heavily out of breath. I risked wiping the sweat off my brow with my sleeve before continuing, only then I had to take a second more to twirl behind Seth, our backs brushing as I dodged another one of his potentially lethal blows. He missed me, but now I was further away from my weapon than when I started. Dang it. “Nothing happened with Tristan last night. He just came over to make sure I was alright, and we fell asleep,” I explained quickly while he stalked toward me, letting me talk. “It was innocent,” I finished meekly. 
	Wrong thing to say. 
	Both hands gripped his sword above his head and he brought it towards me angrily. Oh good God, he was actually going to kill me. Apparently I didn’t need to be scared of Aliah after all. 
	I let out a very girly, very unprofessional scream and dived out of the way, landing on the ground in a painful, sliding softball move that I learned back in junior high. It turned out sliding into home plate on rock hard dirt is actually much nicer than the jagged cuts and frozen burns ice was capable of. No time to think about my injuries, I rolled up to my feet and sprinted across the field to my weapon. 
	Thankfully the katana landed with the hilt sticking out of the snow and I was able to grab it as I ran by and circled around to meet Seth. His eyes were hard honey-colored granite as he orbited around me, waiting for the opportunity to strike.
	“Finally!” I heard Jupiter holler from where he watched us engage. “It should not have taken you that long to get to your weapon Stella!”
	I brushed off his words of “encouragement” and gave Seth a pleading look. “I’m sorry Seth,” I groaned and then flinched when he jerked his arms to the right. 
	He didn’t strike though, instead he continued to circle with me. “He doesn’t belong in your bedroom, Stella,” Seth growled, the muscles in his jaw ticking angrily. “He doesn’t belong anywhere near you. I am your intended.” 
	It took a moment for me to swallow back the rush of feminism that blinded my vision in red. Was he kidding? 
	“Seth, that may be true, but Tristan has been my best friend for as long as I can remember. He practically grew up in my room. That was not his first sleep over and it probably won’t be his last,” I spat, finishing just as his sword clashed with mine. 
	Seth let out a feral, caveman like sound and attacked me with the full force of his skill level. He came against me, swinging his sword faster than I could keep up with and I grudgingly gave up ground as he pushed me back toward the forest. 
	Our swords met time and time again as I struggled to keep him from completely overtaking me. But when my back hit the rough bark of a tall pine tree that lined the field I knew I was in a bad place. I tried to hold my ground and match Seth’s sword swings, but it took all of two more skillful maneuvers on his part before he completely disarmed me, my katana clattering against another tree ten feet away. 
	He stepped forward, but let his weapon drop to his side. He hovered over me, his golden eyes blazing and his neck glistening in sweat from the effort it took to pin me against the tree. We were both breathing so heavily that with every intake of breath his muscular, sweat soaked chest brushed mine. 
	I forced myself to look into his eyes, trying desperately not to be a sore loser. His jaw was still ticking and it did nothing but enhance the masculine lines of his face. I was no closer to catching my breath but it wasn’t because of the battle anymore. 
	“It will be the last time another man is in your bed,” Seth warned, tilting his head down to stare into my eyes, bringing his mouth inches from mine. “I’m trying to be understanding about your relationship with him, Stella, but I cannot and will not tolerate him in your bed.”
	I wanted to snap back with something angry and full of twenty-first women’s rights liberalism, but the words died on my tongue with his warmth completely enveloping me and his eyes looking at me like I was a prize he was sworn to protect with his life. 
	Which was kind of true.
	He stayed close to me, his body pressing against me now. 
	I started having thoughts that had nothing to do with Tristan or training and more to do with the perfection of Seth’s lips and what they would feel like if he wasn’t being so gentle with me. 
	Not that he was being gentle now…. which was kind of the point….
	“Stella, you lost again?” Jupiter snarled, catching up with us in the tree cover. 
	Seth broke away, still breathing heavily. He gave me a sideways glance and from the heat of his eyes I wondered if he was having some of the same thoughts I was. 
	Which was crazy. We barely knew each other. 
	And I had seven years before I had to get serious with Seth. 
	“Again!”  Jupiter called out. “And Stella if you lose this time I will call Aliah myself and specifically ask him to take you away so I don’t have to deal you anymore!” 
	I grunted a jumble of curse words that I was well aware were not proper Star-behavior and pushed off the tree with my elbow. I shook out my hair, pulling it back into a new ponytail and deciding I had to forget about Tristan, Seth and Aliah and figure out how to win this damn training so I could be done for the day and go back to bed. 

----
	
	I walked into the house hours later sweaty, exhausted, disheveled and with my sweatshirt ripped to shreds. It hung awkwardly off of me; since the collar was still fully intact but every other part of it donned jagged, saber shaped gashes. 
	Note to self: Don’t wear sweatshirts to train in.
	Way too much fabric.
	Especially when you have a pissed off Angel trying to teach you an annoying life lesson.
	I bristled again at Seth’s words. I couldn’t deny the attraction between us, and I certainly wasn’t going to ignore the role we played in each other’s lives both now and in the future. But it was still obnoxious to have to deal with it all now. 
	If things had gone according to plan, I wouldn’t have to worry about Tristan sleeping over or the feelings I had for him that used to feel so normal and suddenly felt forbidden and dangerous. 
	I sat down heavily at the kitchen table and then cursed when I realized I forgot to get a bottle of water first. I was too tired now. I would just live with being thirsty. 
	Seth came in a few minutes later, looking sweaty and unnervingly wild, but in that guy way that made you still want to lick him, even though he would taste like salt.
	He walked over to the refrigerator, making himself completely at home which irritated me. And then he pulled out two bottles of water before joining me at the table and sliding a bottle to me.
	Which irritated me more.
	I glared at the bottle, hating that I was so thirsty. Taking a drink somehow felt like a crime against women everywhere. Even though I technically couldn’t even bond myself with women across the world since I was an alien and what not… Still. It was the principle of the matter.
	“I know you’re thirsty,” Seth taunted and his voice rumbled through the room, softening my resolve. He stretched his long arm across the table to nudge the bottle further towards me, the muscles in his bare forearm tensed and pulled in the effort. I was mesmerized. 
	Grudgingly mesmerized.
	“Don’t be a sore loser,” he teased.
	“I didn’t lose,” I reminded him. “That’s why we got to quit. I won.”
	“You’re right,” he relented and for a second I thought he was sincere. “It took seven hours…. but you did win.” 
	I gave him another dirty look and he chuckled in response. Well at least he had found his sense of humor again. 
	“Glad to see you worked out all your frustration,” I growled bitterly. And even though I silenced him, I still couldn’t look him in the eye. 
	“Stella, I’m sorry.” My eyes flew to his when his voice turned from teasing to hauntingly serious. “You’re right, I was frustrated. But I was also hurt…. I felt like we had this big moment, I mean…. you mean everything to me and last night you were almost taken from- I went through hell last night, for those few moments you were gone that was utter hell. And then you came back to me and it was exactly the opposite of hell and it was great between us. We took this step forward and I actually felt like we were on the same page.” Seth paused for a long moment and I think he was waiting for me to say something, but I couldn’t, I didn’t know what to do with his honesty, or the raw emotion he was showing. Finally, he sighed and continued. “Anyway, when he walked downstairs this morning and I realized where he came from…. I think I lost my mind for a little bit.” He smirked apologetically and my heart melted.
	I couldn’t help it.
	My heart was one, big, buttery puddle.
	Still I was an independent woman after all. 
	Hear me roar….
	“I get that we have this future together, Seth,” I started, smiling a little bit to ease his fears. I took a breath, knowing I had to stand my ground, even if the way his golden eyes watched me carefully, revealing how vulnerable he could be sometimes, made my chest constrict and my lungs completely forget to do their job. “But you can’t just spend a few weeks in my life and tell me what I’m allowed or not allowed to do. Granted, Tristan should never have slept over. I get that. And not just because of this thing between me and you…. He shouldn’t have slept in my bed because it was disrespectful to my parents and it’s not the kind of girl I am. And if I’m going to be honest, it won’t happen again. And only partly because my daddy would kill him. Seriously…. he would kill Tristan….” I thought about that for a moment and shuddered from the thought of what that would be like before continuing, “But you and me, we decided to let things happen naturally and slowly and even if there is kind of an expiration date on that mentality, I am still treating our relationship as if we have a choice. I need that; I need to have an actual choice in the matter. So you can be jealous or whatever, but I don’t want to hear about it. And I really don’t want to be told what I can and cannot do. At least until you are officially my boyfriend.”
	“Or your fiancé,” Seth smiled that charming, disarming smile of his and I hoped he took me seriously.
	“Whichever one comes first,” I mumbled, knowing that would get under his skin.
	But he just laughed. “You’re right, Stella. It won’t happen again. Like I said, I’m sorry.” 
	“I forgive you,” I replied sincerely. “Now go home. You stink.” 
	“You don’t smell so good yourself,” he tussled my hair on his way out, and then I broke into a huge grin.
	It died when he left though and my parents moved into the room like hawks waiting to prey on their next meal. 
	Shoot. 
	“Stella, you know Tristan is not allowed in your room anymore, right?” my mother asked and I could tell she was the calmer one of the two, even though both of them looked decidedly less angry than I expected them to look. 
	“Yes, I know,” I dipped my head, ashamed.
	“You’re grounded this whole week, young lady,” my father continued, and I couldn’t bring myself to meet his eyes that I knew were boring into me. “And the weekend.” 
	“I figured.”
	“Alright then,” my father announced stiffly and both of my parents made a move to leave the room. 
	“Wait, what?” I demanded. My head perked straight up and I met their eyes easily this time. “That’s it? That’s all I get? One week of being grounded?”
	“Do you want more?” My mom laughed, it was outright and genuine and I loved the sound of it. I had been so afraid my parents were going to be completely and irrevocably disappointed in my behavior or at the very least extremely, incredibly, so scary I might pee my pants angry. 
	“No!” I gushed, trying to keep from smiling too. “I just thought there might be more….?”
	“We heard your conversation with Seth, honey,” my father explained and my cheeks brightened with an instant blush. “You’re more responsible and dedicated than your actions demonstrated last night. Don’t let it happen again.”
	“Yes sir,” I replied respectfully. 
	My mother left the room, hiding her smile, but my father pulled her back against him before she could get too far. “Seriously Stella, don’t let that happen again,” my father warned, lifting one of his hands and pointing a long, slender finger at me. “Don’t make me have to talk to you like you’re an irresponsible child ever again, Stella-bean. You’re not one and I want you acting with all the manners and etiquette classes I paid for over the summer!” 
	I cracked a huge smile, my father had been threatening me with etiquette classes my whole life. He thought they would help us blend into humanity. He smiled back and then dipped his head to kiss my mother lovingly on the neck before leading her into the living room. I watched my parents retreating backs and couldn’t help but wonder if Seth and I would ever be that close…. if we would ever fall that much in love.
	It was definitely hard at this point, especially when I had to keep trying to convince myself that Seth could actually like me for me and not because of some career obligation made by his dead parents. Or a Council of Elders that had never met either of us and paired us together before we were even born. 
	Aliah was hardly the beginning of my problems….

Chapter Nineteen

	Today was officially Valentine’s Day. It felt weird falling on a Thursday, especially when the dance wasn’t until tomorrow night. I had so far avoided Tristan and Seth today, save for the carpool to school this morning, but that was always awkward and silent. Not that I was expecting a gift from either of them and I actually said a million prayers over the last week that neither one would attempt some kind of holiday-induced declaration of love or anything like that.
	Not that either one were in love with me. 
	But things had gotten so awkward and tense between our group with both of them constantly facing off in their battle of testosterone fueled male dominance that I was terrified an explosion was just around the corner. And I prayed it wouldn’t happen on or near this weekend while everyone else celebrated love.
	I took a big breath and sat down at the lunch table. I tried to shake off the knowledge that there were three very brave and careless Shadows lurking in the corners of the cafeteria. I ignored completely the fact that a greater evil presence existed close by, or at least I had the feeling that one was close by. Seth seemed unfazed though and I was convinced this was just a residual effect from the more obvious evil presence in the lunch room.
	Or I was trying to convince myself that. 
	Seth sat next to me like usual and when I set my tray down on the table, his arm went immediately to my lower back in a gesture I was completely comfortable with. Tristan stiffened across the table and gave Seth a deathly stare down. 
	Here we go.
	“Oh you guys are so cute!” Piper gushed, giving Tristan a pointed look of her own before turning to us with a sweet smile.
	I shrugged out of Seth’s arm casually, feeling uncomfortable that Piper was referring to us like we were a couple. We weren’t. 
	Not yet anyway.
	“Thanks Piper,” Seth replied sweetly. At least he enjoyed her excitement. “I think we’re pretty cute too.” He smiled down at me, his grin stretching across his face and revealing his perfectly white, perfectly straight teeth. 
	I smiled back, but shifted uneasily with his eyes so intensely on mine. Things were fine after our one disagreement and relatively back to normal. But Seth was right, we’d taken a step forward the night he kissed me and then after Tristan spent the night it felt like we took five giant steps back. 
	I knew it wasn’t because of anything Seth had done, or for lack of effort on his part. It was me. It was all me. But I wasn’t ready for Seth yet; and so we kept our relationship in the strange limbo that was somewhere between friendship, partnership and a future marriage together. 
	“Big plans for tonight, Lincoln?” Seth engaged, giving him an encouraging grin, his eyes dancing with mischief.
	Lincoln cleared his throat from across the table before answering, “Uh, yeah, I have some things in the works,” he gave Piper a quick glance from under his lashes and his clear complexion heated. He really did have perfect skin. It didn’t seem fair.
	“Oh really, like what?” Piper challenged. She brushed her too long, severely straight bangs out of her eyes, and gave him what could only be described as “bedroom eyes.” 
	“You’ll see,” Lincoln smiled and then looked down at his lunch bashfully.
	“I can’t watch this,” Rigley muttered, slapping Lincoln on the back roughly. 
	“Watch what?” Piper demanded, her loving gaze turning to steely daggers, daring Rigley to keep talking.	
	“Watch my man become a whipped little puppy,” Rigley argued exasperatedly as if the answer was obvious. 
	“Rigley, don’t even start-“ Piper screeched until Lincoln reached across the table and put his hand on hers. He shook his head once, his blonde surfer hair flopping into his eyes. 
	“He’s not worth it, Pi,” he said sweetly. “Besides Rigs is jealous. The only woman that’s ever been able to tolerate him is his mom and even she’s not completely convinced yet.”
	“So true,” Rigley laughed, pushing Lincoln’s head away from him. 
	“Do you have plans for tonight, Stella?” Tristan suddenly broke his lunchtime vow of silence. He stared across the table at me, his expression so hopeful it took me a moment to remember how to swallow. 
	“Uh, why?” I asked, ignoring the way Seth’s body tensed next to mine. 
	“I thought you could come over tonight. Trader and Trenton are coming home for the weekend and mom is making a big meal tonight. Thought you might want to see them. Plus Truman’s been asking about you lately.” 
	Geez Tristan, way to lay on the guilt…. I shifted uncomfortably on the bench.  
	“Who’s Truman?” Seth asked, giving me time to think things through before I answered Tristan.
	“Um, Truman is Tristan’s little sister. We usually spend more time together but I’ve been so busy lately that I haven’t seen her since Christmas break,” I explained, feeling a stab of guilt in my gut. 
	“Stella’s pretty much her favorite person, they’re like sisters,” Tristan cut in, only his explanation sounded more like a threat. 
	“Since she doesn’t have any,” I went on. “Uh, sisters that is.  And neither do I.”
	“So the other guys?” Seth asked, his eyes cutting across the table to Tristan. 
	“They’re Tristan’s older brothers. But don’t they have big dates or something for tonight?” I looked at Tristan who was purposefully keeping his eyes locked on me.
	“That’s why they’re coming home,” Tristan explained. “They’re trying to avoid Valentine’s drama.” 
	“Me too….” I mumbled low enough that not even Seth heard me. 
	I had been watching the three scattered Shadows out of my peripheral. Bree butted in the conversation, gushing about how hot Tristan’s brothers were and I took the opportunity to take stock of the room. The number of Shadows had grown immensely; the high corners of every wall seemed covered in them as they whipped their slender bodies back and forth. I sucked in a gasp, and tried not to burst into a glow light right here. When students around the cafeteria started to notice them, a prickling, nervous sensation washed over my body. This was not going to end well.
	“You’re just as close with Tristan’s brothers, I take it?” Seth asked dryly, his eyes flickering to the walls of Shadows, widening in surprise and then landing back on me. He acknowledged the evil presence, but was still waiting for an answer from me. 
	“Uh yes,” I couldn’t help but fidget nervously. 
	“She’s basically part of our family, my parents love her,” Tristan declared loudly. I shrunk down, hating that something that was true made me feel so uncomfortable. Or maybe it was just everybody’s eyes on me, like me being close with Tristan’s family was a betrayal to Seth, or that me being close with Seth was making me unfaithful to Tristan.
	“So then if you guys ever dated it would be like incest, right?” Piper asked with feigned innocence. I wished I could laugh at her cleverness. Even if it was the wrong thing to say, my friend Piper was funny.
	“Cassidy, I don’t have the patience right now,” Tristan warned, using her last name like he was talking to one of his teammates when they were losing. “What do you say, Stel? Want to join me for dinner?” Tristan turned back to me, re-including me in the conversation. I swallowed around the nervous lump in my stomach and twirled the end of my hair just to give my hands something to do. Tristan’s eyes bore in to mine, their color sparking to life as he waited for my answer. There was something intimate in his gaze, something beyond this power play game he and Seth were playing. He was asking more of me than dinner, I just wasn’t sure what yet.
	“Um, my grandpa had that thing tonight, though,” Seth reminded me softly of the training that was planned for after dinner, just like every other night. I turned to meet his eyes, realizing he wasn’t even being possessive, he was reminding me in the sweet Seth way that only he was capable of. He was still giving me a choice, but reminding me of my responsibilities. 
	“Uh….” I stammered, feeling like my heart was being pulled in two very different directions. The smell of sulfur drifted through the air, distracting me for a minute and grabbing the attention of our table. Finally. Everyone started looking around, finding the Shadows that clustered together like black beehives.
	“I say you blow both these clowns off and come out with me, Stella. I won’t even pretend like my family wants to have dinner with you. You and I can actually celebrate Valentine’s Day,” Rigley declared, making the act of celebrating sound very, very dirty. I let out a nervous laugh as he ran a hand through his mop of hair seductively and waggled his eyebrows at me. 
	For the first time in my life I was willing to take Rigley up on his not so serious offer. And then the spiritual world I had access to collided with the physical world I lived in as the Shadows erupted from the walls they congregated on, screeching and hollering violently. There was no more ignoring them, since they made their presence so clearly known. They swirled around the room like they were trying to start a tornado, dipping in between the students who covered their heads with their hands and then ran from the room. This wouldn’t make sense to anyone paying close attention, but knowing the human condition was prone to denial and the fact that Shadows could be logically, or at least reasonably explained away as a freak infestation of bats, I put my faith in that explanation and faced my nightmare come to life. 
	The acrid scent of rotten eggs and death wafted through the air and I felt the familiar rush of nausea from the unearthly scent that grated against my nostrils. Students throughout the cafeteria couldn’t ignore the awful aroma anymore and covered their faces as they fled from the cafeteria. I looked to Seth whose ferocious gaze confirmed my suspicions that this was unprecedented and dangerous. Usually humans were blind to this world completely; Shadows were never visible to humans except under unique circumstances. Apparently unique now included the Mead High cafeteria. It was like the veil between the physical world and the spiritual world had been lifted. I didn’t understand why, I just knew I had a job to do. 
We joined the stampede of students and teachers fleeing the cafeteria and met back up with everyone outside the school. Someone set off the fire alarms inside and the loud sirens rivaled the still shrieking shadows from inside the cafeteria.
	Outside the dark grey sky was spitting sleet. Lightning flashed on the horizon and a chill washed over my body. In the long, desolate winters of Nebraska, it wasn’t completely uncommon for there to be lightning in the middle of a snowstorm, but this was the work of a supernatural presence and had nothing to do with the extreme weather of the Midwest. The clouds grew visibly darker overhead and I felt more than anything that whatever was still inside the school was waiting for me. 
	Rescue sirens could be heard in the distance. I didn’t have much time to draw the Shadows out of the building before humans would have to face them. 
	I stood up abruptly and announced, “I think I’m going to be sick, I need to go,” I started to walk away and then realized my alibi sucked since I needed Seth. I reached down and grabbed a handful of his shirtsleeve before yanking him up with me. “And I’m going to need Seth.” 
	I ignored Piper’s hurt look at choosing Seth in my time of need over her, completely avoided Tristan’s eyes because I knew they would be filled with worry and ignored Rigley’s snide, “You need Seth to get sick?” and bee lined it back into the school. Seth and I rushed passed teachers who were too busy watching the darkening sky or covering their ears against the unearthly sounds coming from the building and snuck back in through a side door that had been propped open. 
	I turned around in the hallway just in time to see thousands of Shadows swoop down in an angry mob and pummel towards us. Seth and I threw our bodies to the ground as they filled the hallway around us and kept going, their trail narrowing to a point at the end like caricature of the devil’s pronged tail. The sound that followed them was deafening, their screeching echoed against my ears and the scent of Hell filled the air.
	“I don’t have a weapon!” I shouted to Seth with my hands still covering my ears. Our bodies were encompassed in a soft glow as we let our light expand in order to protect ourselves.
	“I do, in my locker!” he shouted back and tilted his head toward where the hallway came to a T thirty yards away. He held up two fingers, letting me know he had two swords waiting for us and I was suddenly so thankful for his preparedness I could have kissed him. 
	Except there was a serious chance that kissing Seth would lead to our untimely deaths, so I refrained. 
	The hallway suddenly became eerily quiet. No more shrieking. No more swishing sounds as the Shadows moved through the halls in their haunting formations. Everything stilled and became absolutely silent. But the smell of death and evil things rotting still filled my nostrils and so I knew they hadn’t left, they were still close.
	Waiting for us. 
	We jumped to our feet in a synchronized effort and took off sprinting down the long hall. Without slowing down we slid into Seth’s locker, his shoes squeaking across the waxed tile. Before he could open the door, the Shadows were back in formation and plunging toward us. I pressed my back into the wall of rusting red lockers and shut my eyes, preparing myself for painful impact. I could feel their ice cold presence even before they hit me, and even though I released my light into the dim school hallway before they could get too close, their momentum was too fast for all of them to completely abort their attack. 
	I held my breath as the brightness of my inner light singed and burned the Shadows that didn’t stop soon enough, their screeching abruptly halted as they were burned into ashes before completely puffing away. I held the circumference of my light in a wide arch around Seth and me and then moved forward so he could open his locker and retrieve the two weapons. They were hidden behind a long trench coat that hung from the center hook of his locker, and velcroed to the back metal wall.
	Geesh, good thing he didn’t have many friends. I was pretty sure that hiding swords in your locker was so against school policy.  
My light drifted down the three separate hallways we stood at the crossroads to, but beyond my warmth that flickered like an ultra-bright candle, I could see the darkened hallways packed with those wicked little wisps of evil. I regulated my breathing and took the cutlass saber Seth held out for me. 
It wasn’t my katana, but it was deathly sharp and immensely capable. I tested out its weight, shifting it back and forth between my hands and swinging it around my body holding it by two hands before I dimmed my light. 
The heat and brightness of my inner essence was fantastic and effective when I needed to keep Shadows completely at bay. But I was a Star and when I turned up the heat and light it started to have adverse effects on the atmosphere around me, which was why Seth hadn’t lit up yet. 
I could already feel the malleable bend to the surrounding lockers after being exposed for a few moments to a light that was capable of burning as bright as the sun. The floor beneath me was sticky from melting and the lights in all three hallways had burst and shattered glass everywhere. 
Well shoot. That was going to be harder to explain away than bats. 
Please, please, please let these people only see what they are ready to believe. 
I couldn’t think about that now though. 
I dimmed my light, so that I was a glowy version of my regular self and Seth heated to join me. We held out our swords, with our bodies perfectly tensed and ready. Then waited for the attack. 
A lone, shrill, shrieking pierced through the school and I relaxed into the instincts that were bred for battle. Instead of attacking though, the horde of Shadows turned and ran instead. They melted together in a combined cloak of darkness and whipped out of our sight down another hallway.	
	Seth and I paused for all of one point two seconds and then used our supernatural speed to chase after them. We were on the tail end of them, racing to slice through their disgustingly, if not a little surprisingly, solid bodies to head off their retreat and hopefully make some headway. 
	As I ran with my sword slashing accurately through my enemies, I was constantly sprayed with the black, tar these creatures considered blood. I suppressed the disgusted shivers and kept on, not even dwelling on the cute, gray bubble skirt I wore, or the pink and black striped preppy sweater I had borrowed from Piper. I promised myself I would replace her sweater if I lived through this, even if she had only bought it because she was feeling “ironically kitschy.”
	I kept pace with Seth easily and when the swarm of Shadows disappeared down the stairwell that led to the locker rooms and creepy bowels of the school I decided to pause and gather our bearings before we continued. Our light could flush out the Shadows easily, but we had to be careful of the boiler room and any damage that couldn’t be easily explained.
	Besides my irrational fear of basements, the Shadows had gone suddenly quiet, seemingly sucked into the vortex of the unknown. The hairs on the back of my neck sprung straight and my eyes watered with nervous energy. This could not be good. 
	I heard voices in the distance and decided they were the law enforcement investigating the cafeteria and what I could hear be referred to as the “bat problem.” I nodded toward the human sounds to alert Seth to be stealthily quiet. 
	I wasn’t exactly sure how we were going to get out of this mess and protect Mead High School, all without making an unexplainable scene. Right now it seemed impossible. 
	But safety first, right? 
	Seth motioned that he would go first and so I followed him into the dim stairwell and down the uneven cement stairs. It was still quiet when we turned the corner into the main hallway that ran the length of the school. There was no movement, no sound, no evil. 
	What in the world?	
	“I could have sworn I just felt the strongest presence….” I whispered as we crept carefully forward. 
	Our swords were held high, and we walked on our tiptoes, ready for anything at any time. A skittering near the boy’s locker room door caught our attention and we followed it, although something clearly didn’t feel right. Actually that was the problem. I didn’t feel anything.
	“What do you think?” Seth asked, paused just on the outside of the locker room door. 
	“This feels a lot like a trap,” I admitted and Seth nodded in quick agreement. “But what choice do we have?” 
	“Wait for Serena and Nate?” Seth suggested. 
	The evil was there again, raising my hairs and reminding me just how elusive and evasive it was. I tilted my head when I realized how close it was, whatever “it” was. It may or may not exist but I was more frustrated than ever that Seth seemingly couldn’t feel the sneaky little evil. I had to get to the bottom of it.
	“That’s if they even know we’re in trouble,” I exhaled a little impatiently, knowing with the mystery evil floating around there was a strong possibility that the heightened evil activity hadn’t even registered with Serena yet.  
	“Stella, I will follow you to Hell and back, just give me the word.”
	“Then let’s do this,” I smirked, feeling confidence surge inside of me. Whatever the outcome, I knew the Council of Elders had chosen me for moments like these, Jupiter had driven me crazy and beat the crap out of me for chances like this and my parents had raised me to be prepared for exactly this moment.
	I couldn’t back down. It just wasn’t in my nature.
	With a quick breath and courage so fierce it formed the expression on his face, Seth shoved through the heavy wooden door. I was at his side before the door could even close and suddenly we were trapped in utter Darkness. The iciness of evil surrounded us, filling our lungs quickly with its presence and turning our blood to slush.
	What was more frustrating than the fact that we had actually walked, willingly into a trap was that we should have known what was on the other side of the door. We were born with a sixth sense for detecting evil. One day I would literally be able to feel an increase in evil activity all the way across the world, but right now I couldn’t even tell what was on the other side of one door before I walked through it. 
	My breathing became quick and labored as I forced air in and out of my lungs, but the pungent smell of death made even the little oxygen I did get torturous. I clenched and unclenched my fists trying to keep the blood pumping to my hands, I needed to be able to grip and swing a sword or this fight would be over before it began. 
	And then they attacked. 
	From every direction and angle. 
Seth and I kept our backs pressed against each other in an effort to protect each other while our swords flailed around us in graceful, skilled movements. There was no stopping the Shadows from touching my skin, slicing away at my arms and chest, my legs and anywhere else they could get to. 
	I winced against the pain, the consuming coldness. Icicles crackled through my veins as the pressure to cave against the debilitating torture threatened to win. I looked back at Seth for just the smallest moment as he fought vigilantly and mercilessly. How could I even entertain the idea of giving up when nothing would convince Seth that it would ever be time to throw in the towel?
	I put more effort into my sword, more of myself into every swing. The Shadows were everywhere; there was no stopping them, no slowing them down. They just continued to attack as we fought them from taking us completely.     
	A concentrated rush of movement on my left side caused me to stumble. I caught myself, never slowing the movement of my weapon, but I was effectively separated from Seth’s protection against my back. Immediately we had to get more involved in the fight, flipping forward or spinning around to keep the Shadows from being able to connect with our skin the best we could. 
	I felt my veins rise from my skin and knew that my golden skin would be marked with their swollen, black trails. I intensified my light and forced the Shadows back; giving myself some reprieve for a moment, but immediately the small space of the locker room felt the effects of the hot light. 
	And then the attack stalled completely. 
	The Shadows retreated to the farthest corners of the room, staying near the ceiling or close to the ground. I felt like we had been entombed in a coffin of evil. This was not going well. 
	From the darkness Aliah stepped out and I couldn’t even be surprised to see him. I immediately softened my light to protect the dilapidated locker room from more damage. 
	Aliah was perfect as usual, his golden brown hair was swept back from his forehead and his intense hazel eyes seemed to match his hair color perfectly. They were crinkled in a happy expression and I couldn’t help but admire the strong lines of his handsome face. His evil nature made my stomach curdle in disgust, knowing it belonged to someone who looked exactly like an Angel should. 
	“Aliah,” I growled. “This is clever.” I gestured with my sword to the room.
	“What’s clever?” he asked, his lips twisting. 
	“School property…. We’re in here, surrounded by people we know…. broad daylight and all,” I offered while his smile grew. 
	“Oh that’s right, I forgot all about your moral code of conduct! Wouldn’t want to damage property that isn’t yours or blind an innocent bystander….” he laughed. 
	“Why are you here Aliah?” Seth asked and then sighed as if this was the biggest waste of time. “Didn’t we just go through this the other night?” 
	“We did,” Aliah admitted shortly. “But I didn’t get the outcome I was hoping for, so I thought I would try again and again and again until you give up pretending to be all holy light and join me!” I flinched at the way Aliah grew more animated with every word until he finished his sentence sounding disturbingly maniacal, his voice punching the syllables with a disconcerting poignancy.
	“That will not happen, Aliah, so why don’t we skip the next several weeks of you trying to date me and we end this right here, right now,” Seth growled, his eyes flashing with something other than light. 
	Aliah relaxed a little then, stretching his arms out like he was yawning. “Doesn’t it feel good?” He waited for us to respond and when we both stayed silent, poised to attack he continued, “The Darkness, can’t you feel it moving inside you, taking hold of those secret places you keep buried. It’s already there, it’s already made a bed. Just give in, let it take over. It’s so much easier. You will feel so much better. I promise.” 
	I took a step back at the hypnotizing tone to Aliah’s silky voice. He wasn’t speaking directly to me; he wasn’t even looking at me. He had eyes only for Seth and a direct link to his conscious. I watched Seth redden from embarrassment and frustration. He gripped his sword tighter but didn’t respond to Aliah verbally. 
	I hated that there was conflict inside of Seth.
	I hated that Aliah knew exactly what to say.
	But I also knew that Seth had to deal with this himself, I couldn’t fight this particular battle for him. He swallowed and it looked painful. I watched the indecision rage inside of him, pulling him in two very different directions.
	Seth faltered for a half a beat more, the cloud of uncertainty settling over him in an oppressive weight that held down his shoulders. He tilted his head away from Aliah to look at me. Our eyes locked, a thousand words and a hundred emotions spoken silently between us. And then his eyes went from pained to brutally determined and I knew which side of his internal battle won.   
	“You can taunt me all you like, Uncle, but I will never join you,” Seth sneered. 
	I wasn’t the only one that flinched at Seth’s term of endearment. 
	“Your sister will be so disappointed to hear that,” Aliah stated simply. 
	“I warned you,” Seth growled. 
	“Oh about Seven?” Aliah laughed and then his expression turned cruel and serious. “You did warn me, but I have a hard time taking you children seriously. She is waiting for me though, better not keep her. She has quite the temper on her, feisty little thing. Did I tell you she was the one to end Sidra? She got so angry when Sidra wouldn’t tell her where you were, I’m afraid she just snapped a little bit. Not enough to completely diminish her light, just enough to dim it a little bit.”
	“Dim her light?” Seth choked as he and I tried to process Aliah’s explanation. “You’re not telling me that she still….” 
	But he couldn’t finish his thought out loud. I couldn’t even finish his thought inside my head. 
	It simply wasn’t possible.
	Aliah shot me a wicked smile, his eyes dancing with malice and unrestrained delight. I wanted to turn my head and be sick but I couldn’t take my eyes off his. 
	“Enough of this,” he announced, still smiling. “End them.”
	And then the Shadows descended again, swarming us before we could stop Aliah from leaving. My light flared to brightness and my sword moved before my brain could catch up. Seth mimicked my movements and our heads were forced from Aliah’s parting words to the battle at hand. 
	The Shadows were everywhere, endless in their attack. I fought against them as best I could but they were simply relentless. My arms moved in practiced strikes, and I was covered with the black tar of their blood. The small reprieve from the icy evil I had gotten during our conversation with Aliah was gone and my blood had turned into the same kind of sleet that fell from the sky outside, it slushed around in my veins making me sluggish and stiff. 
	“We need a more open space,” I grunted to Seth and then let out a feral cry when the disgusting goop of a kill flew into my mouth tasting like acrid death. 
	“We have to get out of here,” Seth agreed, pushing back against a solid wall of evil advancing on him. 
	I turned my fight toward the door but it was completely obscured in the mass of Shadows advancing. I cursed loudly and then wondered how long they had been hiding down here, waiting for us. I wondered how thought out Aliah’s plan was, how deep it went. 
	I knew whatever happened today would have consequences that rippled for a long time, and I couldn’t help but just hope they included me and Seth…. alive.
	“Do you remember the first day you were here? When you came to work out with Tristan and me?” I shouted, bracing myself for the blood splatter I would have to eat.
	“Light up, Stella, that’s the only way we’re getting out of here,” Seth directed, clearly getting my message. 
	There wasn’t a moment to think over the consequences, I let my inner light burst from me in a supernova of heat and warmth. I prayed there were no humans directly outside the building because this was a death sentence for them if there were. 
	The light left me in folds of energy that shattered the ice in my veins and healed my weakening body. I was strong and capable again in my natural state, the brightest I had ever allowed myself to get. The awful shrieking sounds of Shadows filled my ears as they felt the effects of goodness burn through their evil little bodies. Some of them still made it through my force field of light before disappearing, but even then the cuts and injuries they were able to land on my body were quickly healed by the light.  
I could smell the melting lockers around me and I saw the wooden benches burst into flames. We had to get out of here before I blew up the entire building. I reached for Seth who stood in the protective radius of my light and grabbed his hand. 
We blew through the small basement window with a shattering force and bypassed the bleachers and fence that lined the football field before landing in between the snow covered twenty and thirty yard lines. I extinguished my light immediately so I didn’t light the whole field on fire and then breathed in the fresh, cold air, turning on my back to look up at the now black sky. 
Seth and I lay in a pile of upturned snow and dirt, our clothes singed and frayed. Both of us were covered in the dirt that flew up with our hard landing and I could feel new injuries begin to burn from the force of our impact. 
Still our hands were held tightly in each other’s.
We laid there for a brief moment more, taking in all that just happened silently before Seth hopped to his feet, pulling me with him. 
“Come on,” he ordered.
“Where are we going?” I asked breathlessly, not sure if I was ready for his answer.
“To find Aliah so I can kill him and my sister,” he answered and then took off for the sky, my hand still in his.

Chapter Twenty

	No sooner had we made it into the thick cloud cover than we met Serena and Nate. They were untouched by battle yet and both sets of their eyes grew big when they met us. The four of us clustered together made a hole in the black clouds we were taking cover in with our light. All four of us reflecting against the blackness and preparing our bodies to fight again. 
	“We got here as fast as we could, are you two alright?” Serena asked, her eyes glowing with the bizarre mixture of concern and bloodlust.
	“We’re fine, we just need to find Aliah,” Seth bit out, his eyes frantically searching through the dense, murky clouds. 
	“We tracked him here,” Nate said in a low voice and all of us tensed. 
	“He’s not alone,” I warned in a voice just above a whisper.
	“Do you know who’s with him?” Serena asked. A burst of lightning lit up behind her. None of us were afraid of lightning, but the dramatic effect paired with the gravity of the moment sent chills snaking over my body.
	“My sister,” Seth replied.
	“Among others,” Jupiter growled, meeting our powwow in the sky. 
	“Are my parents here?” I asked, wondering why he would be here but not them.
	“They’re trying to control the situation out front,” Jupiter explained. “School was canceled after the weather turned dangerous. The fire department was still inspecting the school for bats when a fire started in the boys’ locker room. They went to deal with that situation, when one of the big Maples lining the parking lot was struck by lightning, toppling over and landing on a couple cars. Nobody was hurt, but the tree and excitement surrounding the fire have left students loitering in the parking lot. Your parents are trying to help clear everyone out while making sure they stay safe.” 
	But in my head I knew the truth, I knew they weren’t safe. And they wouldn’t be safe until Seth and I destroyed this evil. 
	“How did this happen?” I growled, casting my eyes back to the ground that was obscured by cloud cover. 
	“Oh my Callisto,” Jupiter gasped suddenly. His voice was an angry snarl and his red eyes had turned a brilliant reddish-orange with intensity.
	I followed his gaze, looking through where the clouds parted and the football field was visible. Aliah stood in the center of the field taunting me. 
	Or all of us, I realized when I saw Seth’s expression.
	“I’m going to stay here for a moment,” Jupiter whispered. I glanced at Serena and Nate to gauge their reaction to Jupiter’s hesitance, but when I saw their knowing smirks I decided there was more to Jupiter staying behind than fear. 
	Serena led the charge to the field and I followed closely behind, landing with my feet planted firmly on the snow packed ground. Seth and Nate flanked us, their glows so brilliant and blinding I could feel the heat radiating from them. Suddenly I felt better just knowing Jupiter was in the clouds watching over us. He was a tangible guardian Angel. 
	Or guardian grumpy old guy from the planet Jupiter. 
	Either way. 
	Aliah stood watching us. I could feel swarms of Shadows nearby, enough to drag us all down to Hell, but he didn’t summon them immediately and I couldn’t help but wonder what his game was. I could feel how hungry they were though, as the wispy demons waited on the sidelines. Their hunger licked against my skin. I felt the hairs stand up on my neck as they snapped and bit at an invisible gate to get to us. Aliah had them cowed, but they were desperate to consume our goodness and I could feel it in the very fibers of the air between us. The temperature dropped dangerously with such a concentrated evil presence nearby and I struggled not to gag from the scent of sulfur polluting the air.
	My eyes drifted from Aliah to those Fallen surrounding him. They were all former Angels, completely perfect and beautiful outwardly and morally bankrupt internally. Saul was back, along with two other Warriors, one so blonde and pale that he seemed to be all one monochromatic shade of albino and the other with striking silver hair and a scar that ran from his eye to his jawline. And then there were two Stars. The first was shockingly alien like. She had long, soft peach hair that wrapped around her half naked body like a cloak, her limbs were long and lanky and her skin so golden and tanned that she still seemed to glow even with the haze of gray around her.
	And then there was the final Star. 
	Seven. 
	I knew her without anyone saying her name. 
	Seth stood stoically still next to me, his chest not even moving with the effort to breath. His eyes avoiding his sister completely and I desperately wanted to make her pay for her sins against my Warrior. She would pay. I would make her answer for her betrayal. 
Her hair was golden brown like I had imagined in my dream, just like Seth’s, only it was wrapped up in a high bun on the top of her head. Her eyes were just like Seth’s too- liquid gold- and they sat tilted at the corners making her look exotic and mysterious. Her plump, full lips were quirked in an evil smirk and her head tilted smugly on her long, pretty neck. 
	I gulped back a shiver as I took her in, noticing the bright yellow light filtering the air around her. She was clearly evil, everything from her expression, to the posture of her body to the way she was sizing me up screamed immoral and wicked. Yet the light pouring from her in warming purity defied that very notion.
	I tore my eyes away from hers, hating how she had locked our gazes together easily and looked to Seth. I didn’t even want to investigate the range of emotions he was going through, or imagine what this must be like for him. I felt like it would destroy me before the battle even began. And to his credit, he was definitely not going to give anything away. 
	He didn’t even look at her.
	His eyes stayed focused on Aliah, never once straying to the long lost sister that had taken everything from him. 
	He was certainly doing better than me. I wanted to rip her pretty little throat out and send her to the Hell she pledged her life to. 
	“I suppose you have some kind of master plan for challenging us today?” Serena grunted after the silent standoff stretched her patience too thin.  
“We’re waiting,” he smirked while continuing to remain patient. “Since you two refused to play nicely, and die easily,” he finished with a sneer and I wanted to flinch. His eyes flicked between Seth and me with a devouring intensity. He wanted so much more than our death, it was sickening. He wanted our allegiance. I held my ground, boring my eyes into his, forcing myself to stay brave.
	“What are you waiting for?” I asked casually, figuring he hadn’t really lied to me up until this point so why not go for it.
	“Your parents,” he growled and then switched back into a more relaxed version of evil. 
	I shuddered. I shuddered hard. 
	“I thought if one family should get to be together tonight, why not every family,” Aliah declared with a sick twist to his mouth. 
	Seven let out a laugh that filled the space around all of us. The Shadows tittered in the background in response to her musical laughter that chimed like bells. She didn’t sound evil, which was almost more haunting than if she had spoken with a deep growl or worse. 
	The laugh sounded innocent and pure.
	I shuddered again.
	“It is good to see you again, brother,” Seven gushed, her eyes lighting up when she talked to Seth and she bounced on her toes anxiously. “I’ve missed you,” she declared.
	Seven sounded disgustingly sincere, her eyes immediately filling with tears. I was disturbed by her, more than I thought possible. She was older than Seth and I, but her voice was bubbly and young sounding. She was evil, but unexplainably she had an unquestionable bright light and I could have sworn that when she talked to Seth it actually increased in intensity. 
	It didn’t make sense. 
	Her light should be as black as her heart. 
	Seth stood there, not responding except for clenching his jaw as tightly as he could, and tightening his grip on the sword that hung at his side. 
	“He doesn’t miss you, Seven,” Aliah announced. He sounded sad and confused, but worst of all he sounded disappointed in Seth. I wanted to laugh at Aliah for even considering Seth join the other side, but when I glanced over at Seth again I was shocked by how affected he seemed by the disappointment.
	He would never let it show to anyone else, or admit that he was seeking Aliah’s approval, but it was in his amber eyes when they flashed with a desire to please and in the sinking of his broad shoulders that felt the weight of trying to gratify a parent. 
	Seth was facing demons from his past, literally, and he was doing everything he could to hold on to who he was. 
	“You are one sick, son of a b-“ I started before I could even stop myself. 
	But then I was cut off by Aliah himself, “Now, now Stella, we wouldn’t want to get negative marks for performing badly in our training, now would we?” He gestured at the high school, but I knew he was referring to me training to be a Star. “You are a cheeky little thing,” he murmured, his voice slithering over me like slime.  
	“I cannot wait for the day you go to meet the master you decided to serve. That will be a well-deserved life sentence. Hell has a very special place for the depth of your depravity,” I taunted him. 
	“Shut up!” Seven screamed from her place next to Aliah. This time her voice was shrill and ugly, shrieking into the charged air between our side and theirs. “Shut up!” 
	She was standing next to Aliah, almost hiding behind him. He kept his body so that it shielded her without having to put his arm around her and I wondered what their relationship was. He whispered in her ear after her outburst, calming her…. centering her…. controlling her…. and even though it was just for a brief second, he seemed to have the desired effect on her that he wanted. She melted into him, letting his words float over her like a hit of her favorite drug. 
	“Ah, finally,” Aliah announced, although maybe four minutes had passed since we met them on the football field. 
	My heart dropped to the pit of my stomach, and my lungs stopped functioning. My chest constricted painfully and my vision blurred into confusion as six more Fallen walked across the field roughly holding my parents and Tristan. The evil Angels held multiple swords to each of them as they walked across the field and in front of me. 
	For at least a full minute I saw red…. like the actual color. My vision blurred into a hazy nothingness of rage and I fought the urge to rush at the six capable Warriors and fight my loved one’s way to freedom. 
	I shook my head, focusing my vision back on the people I loved most in this world and stopped thinking things through. I let an ancient battle instinct take over that had been passed from generation to generation since the beginning of time, finally landing on me and readied myself for what would be the most important battle of my life so far. 
	My eyes met my parents, who stood with unabandoned resolve, ready for whatever fate they faced. And then flickered to Tristan’s who mirrored their determination. I took a second to stare at him and forced myself to believe he was actually ready to die; but his emerald green eyes shimmered with a strong belief in me and if it wasn’t me that could save him than he could face death. He was willing to die for this…. 
	My heart contracted at the thought of it. The impossible thought of it. I would never let him die for my war. Never.
	“A human, Aliah? Really?” That’s low for even you.” Serena growled, her shoulders quivering with barely restrained anguish.
	“Really?” Aliah asked dryly. “You really think there is something too evil for me?” 
	Laughter bubbled up in Seven again and the sound was hauntingly refreshing in the midst of all the thick battle tension. And because of that, she seemed even more disturbed. I hated the brightness of her light and the depth of her evil mixed together. She shouldn’t be able to keep both. 
	“Off you go, my pet. Say goodbye to your brother and I’ll meet you at home,” Aliah murmured to her sweetly. 
	“Seth won’t you come with me?” Seven asked, her bottom lip trembling in a pout.
	“No, Seven,” Seth growled, his voice husky from a complexity of emotion I couldn’t even comprehend. 
	I began to tremble then, looking across the field at my parents and Tristan, at hearing the turmoil in Seth’s voice. I needed the battle to begin now, I needed to move into action and save some people. My eyes cut to Tristan’s again and held his gaze for a moment, promising him I wouldn’t let anything happen to him. 
	“Till next time then,” Seven smiled impishly at Seth and then she shot across the field to cup his face in her hands. 
	The rest of us stood shocked for just the second it took for her to place a kiss on his cheek and then shoot up into the sky. Seth’s eyes followed her but he stayed next to me, he stayed with me to fight. 
	And I could literally feel the war waging inside of him to follow her.
	Thankfully, with Seven’s movement the battle began. Serena descended on Aliah with all of her heavenly power and the rest of us followed suit. Swords were drawn, metal met metal, and the sound of Shadows shrieking and screaming filled the air. 
	The black sky opened up and snow poured from the dark clouds in a violent blizzard of ice and wind. I let my light extend around me so that I could be as strong of a fighter as possible. Lightning cracked overhead and flashed; striking images of good versus evil all over the field came in short glimpses through the darkness. 
	Seth and I worked together in perfect unison, fighting off Fallen and Shadows alike. Evil seemed to be everywhere, attacking from every direction. I moved so fast and struck out my sword so quickly that it felt like I was fighting blind. I struck before I could see what I was swinging at and I blocked before I could see what was coming. I was engaged with the one remaining evil Star, matching her sword swings exactly with mine, while also fighting off the relentless flow of Shadows that thickened the air into a black choking blanket around me.  
	I had one goal and one goal only and that was to get to my parents and Tristan. 
	It was impossible to see who was winning or who was fighting who. We were a jumbled mess on the football field. 
	A Shadow sliced against my lower back and my knee fell to the soggy floor. I swung my sword up over my head to meet my opponent and made it just in time. She swung down straight with all of her power and the viciousness of her blow jostled and unnerved me. I dug my toe into the ground and sprung forward, knowing she would be off balance because of the power she put into her swing. Without thinking things through too closely, I swung my sword out to the side and across my chest. I hit her weapon at just the perfect place near the hilt and knocked it out of her hands. I let the momentum of my swing turn me in a full circle and then while she still watched her blade fall to the ground with wide eyes, my sword connected with her neck and sliced all the way across.
	Her head lolled forward and then fell hollowly to the ground before her body crumpled and followed. 
	I suppressed a sob and kept moving without looking back at my victim. Shadows had been the extent of my killing up until now, save for the kindergarten hamster that met an untimely and accidental death at my hands years ago. Even if she was evil, even if she had turned her soul over to the Darkness…. she was still a Star, an unnamed and dead Star.
	And I was responsible for her death. 
	I didn’t have much time to think about it though as I was met with another of the Fallen, this one a huge Warrior that had helped drag my parents here. My saber met his and we fought each other just a few feet from where my parents and Tristan still knelt, living at least. They were only guarded by two Fallen now, and I assumed the rest had needed to join the battle…. which was a good thing. 
	A very good thing.
	The bad thing was that my parents were definitely still unarmed and Tristan was in serious danger.
	So was I.
	This Warrior was unbelievably strong. My muscles ached and trembled from the effort to continue to fight and hold him off. My feet started to slow and the Shadows had worked their icy cold death into my veins making me feel inconveniently sluggish. I kept Tristan in my peripheral vision at all times to motivate me to get to him, but this Warrior was determined to end this battle quickly.
	Meaning, he was intent on killing me. 
	Iced bits of snow whipped against my face as the blizzard consumed the air around us. My hair was slicked across my throat and forehead and my clothes were soggy and dripping water. The ground wasn’t softening even with the light of our presence heating it while we fought; the cold temperature of evil seemed to win out even against the ground.
	And it seemed it would win out against me too, as I failed to meet the Fallen’s swing in a fatal error and stumbled awkwardly to the ground. I stared up into his black eyes, with his gray haze surrounding him and my mind found complete clarity. He raised his sword high above his head and stepped on my sword so I was helpless to defend myself. 
	I closed my eyes not giving myself time to think about the end, but it turned out my moment of Zen wasn’t necessary. Seth let out a battle cry of fierce determination and when I opened my eyes again he had flipped through the air and decapitated the Fallen Warrior before the bad guy could turn around and realize he was in trouble. 
	Seth reached for my hand and sprung me to my feet. I shot him a grateful smile before picking up the long broadsword of the headless Warrior and tossing it with extreme accuracy to my dad who stood only five feet away. 
	I foolishly continued to watch him as he caught the sword in his strong fingers and then turned it on the two Fallen guarding him. His arms came up expertly and he crossed the sword in front of him once, taking out the first one and then turned around gracefully to take out the second. They barely registered he had a sword yet before they were dead, their souls now imprisoned in the seventh circle of Hell where they belonged. 
	My father kept the sword and moved into the battle, while my mother stayed near Tristan to protect him. I fought my way back to my first kill and then picked up that sword and tossed it at my mother’s feet. 
	The clanging sound of metal meshed with the whipping wind, but as I turned to help Seth destroy the Fallen he was fighting, I decided it was less. The Fallen looked around a little skittishly with several of their comrades dead and my parents and Tristan free. 
	And then suddenly Aliah let out a cackle of laughter that resounded louder than even the clash of metal on metal. My eyes flew to his as he flashed me a sinister grin and got the upper hand of Serena. His sword plunged into her side, cutting through her like it was nothing. He abandoned his sword, still in her as she fell to her knees on the football field. There was a signal, something said or gestured and then the remaining Fallen took to the sky and fled. Even the last few of the Shadows retreated back to wherever they came from and left us alone. 
I looked up to see Jupiter descending rapidly, his hair disheveled, his sword bloodied in the thick black goo of the Shadows. He had been defending us from the sky, keeping the numbers of Shadows we met to a minimum. Thank goodness for Jupiter and whatever extra aid we could get.
I didn’t wait a second more, I couldn’t. I flew to Tristan with my supernatural speed and flung myself into his arms. I enveloped him in my light, warming him and letting him feel the intensity of my inner heat. He pressed his body against mine, his strong arms wrapping themselves around me with a ferocity of feeling. I felt his heart pound against my own as it tried to beat its way out of my chest. I choked back a sob and promised a jumble of things to him over and over through streaming tears. 
	I hated that they got him, that they brought him into this mess. 
	He dipped his head against my neck, nuzzling me with his nose and the scruff of his jawline and I forced our bodies even closer together.
	“How did they even get you?” I cried, promising myself it would never happen again. My voice was thick with emotion, raspy and hoarse from the effort of battle. My whole body was shaking with exhaustion, but I couldn’t let Tristan go, I couldn’t take my arms off of him. And he seemed just as eager to hold me to him. In a strange way his arms felt like the safest place I had ever been.
	“It’s my own fault,” he answered sounding so much more calm than me. “I wouldn’t leave. Your parents wanted me to, everyone else had gone, but I had to know you were Ok. I had to see you. They came after your parents and I was like this extra bonus,” he explained. His voice wasn’t even shaking, he was completely calm and comforting me. Tristan almost died and he was comforting me! 
	“I will never let them take you again,” I promised, my voice hitching with emotion. 
	“I know Stel,” Tristan agreed gently and then even softer he whispered in my ear, “You are amazing Stella…. seriously incredible.” 
	I lifted my head to tell him thank you, but our eyes locked and I couldn’t remember the words I wanted to say. Tristan was looking at me with the kind of devotion I only saw between people like my parents and his expression had softened to something I should be afraid of. Instead I found myself mimicking the adoration and something deeper…. something still nameless…. and I knew that we were more than friends. Tristan Shields was not my best friend…. he was something so much more.
	“Stella, I need to take Tristan home, away from all of this,” my father’s voice broke through our bubble and reminded me that we were still standing in the middle of carnage, blood and bodies scattered all over our football field.
	I reluctantly let Tristan go, although only because I was planning on following my parents straight home. My mom and dad kissed and hugged me and we told each other how much we loved one another over and over before they took Tristan away to the parking lot. He held my hand all during our goodbyes and when we finally parted I felt empty without him…. painfully alone. 
Now that the battle had stopped, the rest of us were left in eerie silence, even with the blizzard waging its own war against the Earth around us. Nate and Jupiter had moved to Serena and were carefully tending to her wound and trying to remove the sword from her belly before her skin tried to heal around it. 
I watched silently for a moment until I was positive she would recover and then I had to turn my eyes away. There was definitely a limit to how much blood and gore I could take in one day and I had more than reached my quota.
And then Seth was next to me, silent and still.
I fell more than anything right into his arms. He stood next to me the entire battle and I needed his comforting arms around me. He crushed me to him, pressing his lips against my temple and rubbing my back in soothing circles.
“Thank you for saving my life,” I mumbled against him, burying my face in his neck. 
“That’s what I’m here for,” he replied lightly in my ear, but pulled me tighter against him at the same time. “I can’t lose you Stella. I won’t lose you. You’re my Star.”
And then the world started spinning around me as the reality of his words sunk in. I wouldn’t lose him either. I couldn’t lose him. He was everything to me. 
He was my Warrior. 
And my heart stopped beating when I realized that I didn’t just think of him that way on the battlefield. 
Somehow through all of this, he had become more to me too. He was so strong, and brave and valiant yet breakable and vulnerable too.
It didn’t matter what unnamed feelings I had for Tristan. I could never be with him. Seth was my future. And I was mostly Ok with that.
Except at the same time I was mostly not Ok with that too.	
I stopped thinking and breathed Seth in. All of that stuff didn’t matter right now because both of them were safe. And that’s all I could think about. 
For now, that’s all I wanted to think about. 
“All I want to do is go home, take a bath and go to bed for next ten days,” I groaned. Every one of my muscles hurt and my shoulders felt like they were trying to actually remove my arms from their sockets. Jupiter and Nate were helping Serena get to the parking lot and Seth and I had turned to follow them, still leaning heavily on each other. 
“I’m Ok with the home and bath part, but you can’t go to sleep for the next ten days,” Seth admonished me. “We have the Valentine’s Dance tomorrow night and I have a super-hot date for it,” he pulled me closer to him, his arm wrapping firmly around my waist and I could hear the smile in his voice.
I replied with another unintelligible groan which only made him laugh. We were both covered in black goo and blood splatter, but I cuddled closer to him, thankful for his warm light and just him.
“We have to kill him,” I announced somberly, my thoughts drifting back to the battle.
“We will,” Seth promised. “And her.” 
I breathed in deeply and let the frozen night air cleanse my lungs. This war had changed. The Darkness had changed tactics right along with us and we fought a different kind of battle that would take just as much sacrifice and skill as the endless years before us. The only difference this time was that Seth and I were the ones fighting the battle. 
If we didn’t go after Aliah, he would be back for us, although since we killed seven of his entourage I was hoping he would reconsider his effort, at least outside of my small little farm town. If there was one thing I learned through all of this it was how much I truly loved humanity and most of all the community I grew up in. I was definitely not ready to give up high school, or my friends or any of my relationships. But I also wasn’t going to stop myself from becoming the greatest Protector in the history of the Universe. Because this was a planet worth saving, humanity was worth saving.
I knew this meant I would have to give it up to a certain degree. I would have to walk away partially in order to save it. I couldn’t have people I loved showing up at every battle because I knew what it would mean: it would mean that I would gladly let them live and die for them. 
	I was willing to die for humanity. 
	But I wasn’t convinced yet I was willing to walk away. 
	I was called to serve the Earth with Seth. He was my future; together we would protect the last planet. I needed to walk away from my life and into my fate with Seth in order to save the Earth.
	Too bad it was humanity itself that was keeping me from doing that.
	Even with this looming, ominous destiny ahead of me, I knew I would never leave Tristan. He was what made me fall so in love with this life to begin with and he would be what kept me tied to it for the rest of my life.

Chapter One

	Stella…..
	A fast chill slithered down my spine. I snapped my head up and then twirled around. I heard it. I know I heard it.
	Stella…. 
	There it was again. The singsong whisper floated through the just-budding trees, carried by the gentle breeze. 
	I turned in a circle again, desperately seeking the origin of that voice. It didn’t take a genius to figure out the Darkness was playing with me, but I’d rather face something head on than deal with the unknown. 
	It was painfully frustrating.
	And really creepy. 
	I gripped my two katanas in my hand tightly and lifted my chin to the wind, hoping to pick up the scent of sulfur. The long, samurai-type swords felt comfortable and familiar in my tight grasp but still I had to remind myself to relax my wrists and stretch my fingers. 
	Stella…. 
	My name was whispered with a deranged laugh, the sound just a decibel louder, just a few feet closer. 
	Stella come play…..
	I swallowed the quick fear that invaded my blood and took off sprinting. I could be running toward the threat or away from it and really, at this point, I wasn’t sure which scenario I was hoping for. But I moved swiftly through the densely packed trees, leaping over brush, dodging low hanging branches. 
	I could feel the evil closing in around me. 
	I anticipated the fight as much as I dreaded making first contact. 
	My gut told me this was Seven- my arch nemesis and the long-lost sister of my other half and Warrior Counterpart. 
	Other half in the strictly platonic sense of the word, meaning we fought to save the world side by side, complemented each other in every way and most recently drove each other crazy. 
	That kind of other half. 
	At least for now. 
	The breeze turned from light to heavy, from gentle to aggressive. The sky darkened overhead, thick with gray storm clouds that seemed to come out of nowhere. I felt a lone rain drop splatter on my temple and then trickle down my face.  
	I came to an abrupt halt when I felt the Darkness stop in front of me. We were facing off now. My swords were raised, my feet spread apart and evil all around me. Except I couldn’t see anything! 
	“Damn it!” I shouted into the thick forest. “Show yourself!” I ended with a wild battle cry that carried over the now-whipping winds. Freshly budded leaves were ripped from their branches, swirling around my feet and a streak of black lightning hit the ground twenty feet away. It scorched the earth, burning up the new green grass in a spider web of charred ground. 
	Stella….  
	The whisper was there again, soft and delicate in direct opposition to the violent weather. The sound sent tingles of fear skittering down my body and settling in my flexing fingertips. My eyes watered from adrenaline and I prepared myself for the worst.
	Still, I steeled myself with courage and in a taunting voice called back, “Come out, come out wherever you are!”
	Nothing but silence. 
	I wasn’t surprised but I was also disappointed. I just wanted these episodes to be over with. Ever since February when Aliah met Seth and me on the football field turned battlefield, the Darkness had laid relatively low. 
	Shadows were scarce around Mead, Nebraska- the tiny farming community where I lived- although average activity still continued to plague the rest of the Earth. We hadn’t seen another sign of a Fallen, except if you counted what was happening to me now. And Serena and Nate had returned to life as usual, fighting off the army of Darkness while Seth and I tried to finish out the school year. 
	Everything was as it should be. That is, the Darkness still worked as hard as ever to sink its ugly teeth into this world, I was hearing voices and experiencing what I was calling…. visions more than ever. Possibly, I was on the verge of losing my mind completely. And Seth was struggling not to give into the dark side and follow his sister. 
	Not that he would ever admit that out loud.
	It was just something I could feel. 
	In my bones. 
	So maybe everything wasn’t exactly as it should be.
	Mostly it felt like on the surface, we won this huge battle back in February. But really, when we got down to it, Aliah and his minions really emerged the victors- because the rest of us were all messed up now. 
	The winds grew stronger, causing my long, golden blonde hair to whip around my face. I brushed at it with the back of my wrist, but barely made a difference before it was right back in my sight again. 
	Stella…. Stella…. Stella….
	The whisper grew louder until it was a sickly sweet melody that tickled my ears at the same time causing real fear to unfurl inside my chest. I turned around again, just wanting- no, needing this to be over. 
	More black lightning hit the ground a few feet in front of me and I jumped back, a scream ripping from my throat. I steadied myself again, drew my swords forward and then tilted my chin for borrowed defiance. 
	In a low, confident voice I said, “Seven, I’m waiting. We can do this all day or you can stop being such a coward.”
	High pitched, tinkling laughter was the only response, before a huge gust of wind knocked me on my back. My swords clattered off to the side and I lay there out of breath and weaponless.
	I was awesome at this job….
	I flung myself to my feet and tried to lunge for my weapon. A surge of wind pushed me back, away from my katana, but not strong enough to make me fall. I went for my sword again but the same thing happened.  
	I took a step back with my hands in the air. 
	“Fine, we can play it your way,” I said to whatever was out there. “He’s mine you know. Seth is my Counterpart. He’s tied to me. You can’t control him. You never could and you never will.” 
	The winds picked up, whipping around me, plastering my long hair in my vision. The black lightning that streaked from the sky in charcoal flashes, hazy in gray and obsidian crystals, hit aggressively around me. The ground started on fire in little starbursts and then burned out quickly, leaving charred, dead grass in their wake. The sky was nearly black now, with the clouds overhead so thick and dark that it felt like midnight, not mid-afternoon.
	“Let’s go!” I screamed goadingly into the wind. My voice didn’t carry far, but whoever was out there would have been able to hear me easily.
	I started to light up then, I had been patient enough. I couldn’t stand it anymore. The slow burn under my skin grew and grew until I was a solid ball of light. From every piece of me, my Light emanated in blinding, radiant beams. I pierced the darkness with my very essence, challenging the nature of this fight with the inner most part of me. 
	The air around me began to sizzle and pop with the electricity between me and my enemy. The new spring grass didn’t start on fire, but began to brown from the heat coming off my skin. 
	“I’m ready for you!” I shouted. Although, if I were honest with myself, I was keenly aware that was not true. I was in no way ready to fight whoever was behind this force. And if it was Seven- like I suspected it was- I was probably insane for antagonizing her. 
	My Light continued to grow, while everything out of my reach continued to darken. My swords- lying several feet away- were completely camouflaged beneath the blinding light of my Star-essence; the only thing keeping them from disintegrating from my burn was a sacred blessing that protected them from my supernatural heat. The lightning picked up in speed and volume, snapping and sizzling as it lashed out against the earth. I felt the deep vibration of thunder, and the ground moved beneath my feet. 
	This was coming to a head, a culmination of wills. She was done provoking me; this was about to get real. 
	And then the last thing I heard from her was, “Stella!” in the loudest, most unearthly voice I’d ever experienced. The sound of her voice sent chills rippling all over my body, my stomach dropped painfully and the back of my neck ached from tension. This girl was so crazy. 
	But then she was gone. 
	The evil part of the storm disappeared more quickly than it had arrived and the sky went from inky black to soft charcoal. The alien lightning turned back to normal; in the sky, white lightning and the wind died down immediately. 
	Just as a hundred curses popped into my head, the sky opened with a downpour. 
	“Great,” I groaned. I picked up my swords and then took off for one of my father’s barns, the closest shelter from the rain. 
	By the time I reached the metal barn, I was soaked to the bone and frustrated. My hair was plastered to my face and neck and my t-shirt and yoga pants were sucked to me. This was so annoying. 
	Had she really kept me out there just so I would get wet? 
	Or was something completely different going on? 
	This was all there had been since February. I would get caught up in these little almost-battles and then nothing. Not only was I at the end of my rope about it, I felt like I was playing exactly into their hands. Whatever they were planning, I was just going right along with it.
	At the same time though, it wasn’t like I could just walk away when something like that happened. I was stuck. 
	And at their mercy. 
	And I hated it. 
	“Why are you all wet?” Seth asked from behind me, and I jumped at the sound of his deep, rumbly voice. 
	“You scared me,” I panted. At this point I should have been ready for anything, but my thoughts were jumbled at the moment. 
I turned around to face him as he stood in the doorway. He was wet, too, but not as soaking as I was. He had obviously been out running, something he often did from his farm to mine and back again. His light blue t-shirt was darkened to navy from the rain, almost everywhere but on the bottom hem, his running shorts slicked to his muscular thighs. He was barefoot, his feet painted in mud. 
	I sucked in a breath at how delicious I found that. 
	They were muddy feet. I so should have been grossed out, not admiring how manly he looked with dirty toes- and the speckled, streaked arches uncoated like the balls of his feet.
	This was getting weird. 
	Honestly, did I have a foot fetish? 
	I snapped my eyes up to his face as quickly as I could, bypassing his spandex-looking thighs drenched from the rain. He was so gorgeous; I couldn’t breathe for a second. 
	This was a reaction he got from me a lot. It wasn’t fair. Seriously, it was not fair. He was an Angel, a real-life, perfect, flawless Angel. And even by those standards he was exceeding expectations. 
	His golden brown hair was extra curly, tussled and messy from the rain. His amber-colored eyes brightened with excitement and anticipation as he watched me check him out. His strong jawline was ticking; the muscles in his long, slender throat worked to swallow. 
	My breath hitched. I couldn’t help it. He was so wickedly sexy. 
	“Stella? What are you doing out here?” He asked again. His voice dropped even lower and he took a step towards me.
	Wanting to defuse the electrified air between us, I breathed out. “Seven. I think Seven was out there. I was in the fields training with my katanas and there was this presence.” I turned my back on Seth and walked to a work table to set my swords down. After being mesmerized by Seth I had forgotten I was still holding my weapons. This was a barn where my dad kept most of his equipment. Combines, tractors and skid loaders were parked everywhere, mingled with a few lawn mowers, four-wheelers and snow mobiles. 
	“What happened?” Seth was right behind me. He put a strong, warm hand on my shoulder. It sent a shiver straight down my spine, so forcefully my whole body shook from it. I blamed the fact that I was freezing to the bone and his hand was incredibly warm. Nothing more.
	“Nothing happened,” I sighed, turning into his warmth a little. I let myself glow; my natural heat warmed me up and started to dry me out. “There was this whole onslaught of crazy weather and black lightning and then nothing. She, or it, or whoever it was, just…. left.” 
	“You know it was Seven for certain?” I heard the anxious tone to his question, the pain that was equal parts dread and hope. He hated his sister; he wanted her dead. And at the same time I could feel- because of the bond that tied us together for eternity- his agony over her lost soul. 
	It was the worst and most painful part of every emotion. And I loathed that he had to go through this. I could not wait to kill her and put him out of his misery. 
	She was top priority for me. Even over Aliah- the main bad guy on Earth and my biggest threat. His goal was to kill or enslave Seth and then do the same to me; but mostly he just wanted to kill me. Once we were out of the way the Earth would be his and he would infect every good and living thing with his Darkness. 
	Earth would fall. 
	The last remaining vestige of life in the galaxy. 
	And the Darkness would win.
	Too bad that would never happen.
	There would always be a replacement for me. Well, hopefully. Even though other planets had all been gifted protectors, they had all ultimately died too…. 
	Plus, there was always more bad guys it seemed.
	Enough. In the past few months I had gotten in the habit of not thinking about the big picture. It was too overwhelming. I gave myself small goals and when I reached them, I could feel like I actually accomplished something. 
	Such as: Kill Seven. Learn to use a broadsword effectively with one hand instead of two. Stop falling in love with Tristan. Find a dress for prom. Master my in-air-combat. Learn my part in choir for the spring concert. Kill Aliah. And get out of planting with Dad this spring.
	Easy. 
	“I know it was her,” I answered firmly. I knew he didn’t want to doubt me, but it was like he still couldn’t help but think the best of his older sister. At the same time he thought the worst. This only added to his guilt. 
	He turned me toward him, using that hand on my shoulder and then wrapping his arms around me before I could protest. His body was hot and aglow, and I loved how I felt squeezed against his chest. This was part of my Star-nature. I was completely drawn to warmth and heat and the glow was about the most beautiful thing in the world. 
	Except, I couldn’t. Not yet. This was way too soon. 
	But then Seth dipped his face down so that his forehead rested in the crook of my neck. His arms were still firmly around me, one across my shoulder blades, the other wrapped tightly around my waist. 
	“Are you Ok?” he rumbled against my skin. His lips pressed against my collarbone and even with my t-shirt in the way I could feel how warm and soft they were. 
	A tumble of butterflies erupted in my stomach and I closed my eyes against the sensation. “I’m fine.” But it was a whisper, barely a breath. 
	My hands rested awkwardly on his back, but that didn’t deter Seth from pulling me tighter against him. He lifted his head just a little, and pressed a sweet, lingering kiss against the side of my neck. My wet hair was matted against the column of my throat but that didn’t diminish the sensation at all.
	“Seth,” I gasped in a shaky whisper. 
	I meant to step away, but he took that as encouragement and let his nose skim up my neck, across my jawline and to the place behind my ear. 
	“I didn’t feel that you were in trouble,” he growled against the skin back there. I felt the vibration with every word. 
	I couldn’t respond. I couldn’t even pretend to be thinking this through. My hands now clutched at his wet t-shirt, desperate for some foundation to hold on to. 
	“That won’t happen again,” he promised. And then he placed a kiss where he already held his lips. I shivered and leaned into him, unable to help myself. 
	He kissed me again. And then he kissed the curve of my jaw. My temple. My cheek. The corner of my mouth. 
	Oh, god. 
	“Seth,” I gasped stronger than before, a clear warning to stop. 
	My heart was hammering inside my chest, desperate and confused. My blood was hot and my skin burning with my glow. This was…. confusing. 
	Seth tensed and froze. His face was still dangerously close to mine, his lips still hovering, poised to make contact. I knew with the smallest encouragement he would kiss me again. 
	But it would be more than a kiss. I had a link to his emotions and I could feel his desire. It wouldn’t just be a kiss. It would be life-changing. 
	He would shake up everything.
	And maybe I wanted that. Maybe I wanted that certainty, that final sign that this was my destiny. 
	But then maybe I didn’t? Maybe a huge part of me felt- albeit irrational- like I was betraying Tristan. If I gave in to Seth, it would be like none of my feelings for Tristan mattered. Or like he didn’t occupy a huge piece of my heart. 
	Because he did.
	And even if nothing could happen between Tristan and me…. ever, I still wasn’t willing to just turn my back on those very real feelings and give up completely.
	“Don’t do this, Stella,” Seth growled but then backed away. 
	He finally released me and jerked two hands through his tangled hair. His skin was still alight and tensed, his muscles standing out perfectly. His amber eyes were shining gold and they flashed at me with frustrated anger.
	“Seth, I’m not ready for this,” I mumbled, knowing it didn’t matter what I was ready for. The Darkness had proved that time and time again. “This needs to happen naturally.” That was a lie. I was stalling and he knew it.
	He shook his head, shooting me an arrogant glare. “Don’t push me away,” he demanded. I jumped at the authoritative tone. “You want this to happen naturally? This is as natural as it gets.” He took another step back and then pinned me in place with an expression so dangerous, so honest I stopped breathing. He was such a force of nature. 
These were the moments when I knew we would ultimately win against Aliah and all his minions. These were the moments I knew they didn’t stand a chance. But then I had to wonder if I did either? “It is unnatural for me to stay away from you. To not kiss you every single time I want to. I should be able to claim you, Stella. You should be mine.” 
	I gulped against everything his speech insinuated. Um. I couldn’t even work that out right now. So I got angry instead. “You told me we would take this slow! You told me I didn’t have to do anything I wasn’t ready for.”
	He was primed with the retort, “I didn’t realize taking it slow meant I had to compete for your affection! We’re young. I knew you weren’t ready for the whole life-long commitment thing and everything that entailed. I told you we would take it slow so that you didn’t feel pressured to get married!” 
	“I need more time, Seth,” I finished the argument in a broken plea. 
	“Fine,” he slammed his hand down on the work table, my katanas jumped and clanged together at the impact. “You take your time. I’ll just be waiting in the wings whenever you realize Tristan is not the man for you. Can never be the man for you.”
	“Seth, you don’t have to-“
	“Yes, I do!” His voice was just barely under a shout; he was pissed off to the max. “For me, there is no one else. And I will never pretend otherwise.” His eyes flashed with more pain than I had ever seen in them before. My heart cracked down the middle when I realized this was causing him as much pain as his sister. That I was causing him so much pain. “There’s no one else for me, Stella. I won’t pretend differently. And that’s Ok with me because I don’t want anyone different. I just want you. I just want you to recognize me for who I am, to know that I’m yours. So that we can be together. So that I can come home to you.” 
	I winced and smashed my lips together so I wouldn’t make promises I didn’t, couldn’t mean. 
	How could I even argue against that? Why did he have to be so damn perfect? 
	He looked at me momentarily, shook his head, and turned away. His shoulders were stiff and rigid, and I wanted nothing more than to walk over to him and put my hand on his shoulder like he did to me. But I knew I couldn’t. 
	Not after all that.
	And it seemed he knew that, too, because the next time I blinked he was already out the door and gone. 
	And I was left more confused than ever. 
	I probably would have stayed there too, in my soaking clothes with a million thoughts tumbling through my head, but another whispered, “Stella…..” from the rafters had me chasing after Seth and finding refuge in my old farmhouse. 
	I seriously needed to deal with Seven pronto. Enemy number one.
	And then I would deal with Seth and all this confusion.

The Rush
The Siren Series
Book One

To Miriah,
My dear friend.
Here’s to honesty and the F word. 

Chapter One

	“Are you sure you’re up for this? You know after everything that happened last time?” asked the blonde haired sexpot dropping me off. My best friend, one of two of my only friends, and she was not even going to let me pretend this was okay. 
	Which was why I loved her. 
	Even if my blood pressure could not even handle this situation. 
	“Obviously not,” I snapped. I took a breath, and then another one and then counted to five in my head to calm down, or attempt to calm down. I didn’t need to apologize to Exie; she would know she wasn’t the reason for my temper. Well, at least this time. “But what choice do I have? He says I have to go back to school, so she is making me go here. God, I can’t wait until I’m eighteen.”
	“Like that will make any difference,” Sloane, the final third of our threesome remarked bitterly.
	“Focus on the trust funds ladies; we have a plan,” I repeated our lifelong mantra softly, knowing it would soothe all of our nerves. Only two more years to go until that money became mine and I planned on taking full advantage of the dearly departed biological father I never got to meet. He stayed married long enough to my mother to knock her up, take care of my future and then give up his fight with cancer.
	Thanks a lot Daddy Dearest.
	That’s what made him such a phenomenal fatherly candidate. The cancer that is, and all of the money of course. 
	And it didn’t hurt, I’m sure, that before his illness had nearly finished the job of murdering him slowly and the chemicals had taken away his hair and stripped him of his dignity that he happened to be a very attractive man. 
	Or so my mother says.
	I’ve never even seen a picture of him. 
	“I need to get out of here,” Exie grumbled, flipping her waist length blonde hair over her shoulder. “I feel like I’m going to catch something.”
	“You’re such a snob, public school is not contagious,” I laughed.
	“Are you sure about that?” Sloane clarified, narrowing her big brown eyes on the downtown campus.
	Since I actually wasn’t sure, I didn’t answer. It could be contagious, what did I know? 
	“You guys better go anyway. We’re going to get mobbed if you don’t and I am really not in the mood for a pack of rabid high school boys this early in the morning. Or worse, jealous girlfriends.” I twirled a loose auburn curl around my finger absentmindedly, trying to remain casual. I didn’t like to get worked up about things. I mean, sure I was probably a little bit feisty with my temper, but other emotions bothered the hell out of me and I preferred to avoid them all together- yep, all emotions. 
	“What are you going to tell them, Ivy?” Exie asked with just the tiniest tone of sympathy. I turned to look her in the eyes, knowing both these girls hated feelings just as much as I did. I couldn’t say that’s why we were best friends. Honestly, we were friends because we had no other options, but it did surprisingly bond us together in a way that didn’t make much sense. 
	“I’m not going to tell them anything. I’m going to let them believe whatever rumors they want to and just focus on getting to graduation day.” I sighed, knowing that whatever rumors were being spread were not kind or flattering, but it was a routine I was familiar with. 
	“If that’s what you want,” Sloane sympathized. I had been down this road before, but a six month absence from school would only intensify whatever was being spread around about me.
	“If you have a better idea S, I’m all ears. But I can’t tell them the truth, the girls will hate me no matter what, and the boys will keep being boys. So it doesn’t really matter what story they believe as long as they leave me alone in the process,” I snapped again. 
	Sloane let out a very long, exaggerated sigh and nodded her head in agreement with my argument. “You’re right.”
	I sighed feeling guilty for my irritable behavior and gave her an apologetic smile. She raised a slim shoulder casually and sent me a small smile so I knew she didn’t hold it against me. We were all nervous about my return to school, all on edge. At least she understood where I was coming from. 
	“Hey, Ivy,” a teenage boy approached confidently. Oh, great here we go.
	“Oh hey, um…” I gave him a little head nod and prompted him for a name. 
	“Uh… I’m Chase Merrick, we had a, uh, we had chemistry together last year,” Chase’s confidence started to fade under the scrutinizing gaze my friends and I were subjecting him to. 
	“Oh, yeah, I remember,” I lied, and forced my lips into a smile. It was almost painful. “How are you?” 
	“I’m good,” he smiled one of those charming smiles that popular boys reserve for their next conquest. 
	Lucky for him I was easy.
	Okay, not easy… I kept my legs together. 
	But I was looking for a boyfriend. I know that sounded trashy, but to be fair it wasn’t like I was some jungle animal on the prowl. It was just safer to be committed to someone. Plus, he was cute in that all-American way with his floppy sandy brown hair and perfect, white teeth. He even wore a letter jacket which was a major bonus for him even if he didn’t know it yet. A letter jacket meant that if I could tolerate this relationship longer than this school day he would at some point offer it to me and in turn I would wear it every day to support my awesome new boyfriend. That all led to effectively branding me as “taken” for the whole school to see. 
	On closer examination he had dimples. 
	Another point for… um… Chase?
	Yes. Chase. 
	“So you’re back?” he asked breaking the silence and my tally of his better qualities. 
	“We’re going to go, Ivy, before you know, we need a prescription for this or something,” Exie interrupted in her best valley girl impersonation. 
	“Alright, pick me up?” I asked, turning to receive the light hug each of them would give me. It was moments like this that we were perfect imitations of our mothers. And that annoyed the hell out of me.
	“Oh, do you need a ride?” Sloane asked barely containing her smirk. 
	“I could give you a ride if you need one,” Chase gallantly offered.
	What a gentleman. 
	“Really? I don’t live far. Thank you. That would be such a life-saver,” I played up my enthusiasm, but everything inside me felt dead. 
	“Sure, it’s my pleasure,” Chase smiled again, popping out his identical dimples. 
	“Ladies, I’ll call you later,” I told them. I turned to face them while walking backwards up the long set of stairs that led to the school building. 
	“Just breathe, Ivy,” Sloane called out knowing I needed some last minute advice. “Two years, that’s all, just two years!” 
	I continued walking backwards, taking each step in stride and watched Exie and Sloane climb into Exie’s brand new, silver BMW. She gunned the engine and then cut across traffic dangerously.
Central High School was located exactly downtown Omaha on one of the busiest streets, Dodge, which ran almost exactly down the middle of the city. It was also the most traffic jammed street, especially at this time of the morning. Exie was lucky she didn’t nick her brand new car in the onslaught of oncoming traffic. She got off lucky with a few honking horns and a confused but angry homeless man who screamed obscenities at her from the sidewalk.
	I cringed for her and her lack of driving ability. But then again, she probably didn’t even notice. 
	“So, Chase, are you a junior or a senior?” I asked, dropping my gaze to my future boyfriend as he followed me up the stairs like a loyal puppy. 
	“A senior,” he smiled. He answered everything with a smile. His happiness was going to a problem. I really hated breaking the happy ones’ hearts. 
	“Oh, exciting!” I gushed, and this time I almost meant my enthusiasm. He only had nine months left until he could write his own ticket out of here.
	So jealous.
	“Yeah, I guess,” he laughed, probably surprised by the sudden energy in my voice. “I still have to figure out where I’m going to school next year though.”
	“Undecided?” I asked and he nodded in response. “I’m sure you’ll figure it out. You seem like a smart guy.” 
	I said that generously because I seriously had to wonder why we would have been in the same chemistry class if he were such a genius. Although maybe chemistry had been one of my AP classes…. I couldn’t remember. Last year seemed so long ago and I really hated remembering it anyway. 
	He chuckled at my way-too-cliché compliment and mumbled a “thanks.” 
	Chase actually seemed like the kind of guy to be put off by obvious flirting. He was the type of guy that could probably pick and choose his girls and didn’t need them to throw themselves at him for attention. Ugh. It just wasn’t fair that he didn’t really have a choice when it came to me. 
	“I like your hair this color, by the way,” his smile turned shy. 
	“Not a fan of the black?” I forced myself into a conversation about my past. Really, seriously, truthfully…. I hated thinking about anything from last year.
	“I mean, it was pretty. You could do anything to your hair and you would still be gorgeous,” he offered thoughtfully, like I didn’t already know that. It was all part of the curse. “But I like this red color; it goes better with your freckles.” He reached up and brushed his pointer finger along the bridge of my nose to emphasize his point. 
	I crinkled my nose in reaction and blushed a deeper shade of red than I felt comfortable with. I hated my freckles. Hated them. Granted they weren’t excessive, just a smattering of light brown on the bridge of my nose, and no doubt designed to make me some kind of more beautiful than the average girl, but they drew every eye and boys were constantly making comments about them. 
	Like now.	
	“This is my natural color,” I offered that piece of personal information free of charge and wildly out of character for me. It would be the only one he got. “After everything that, uh, happened last year, my mom made me dye it back. Believe me when I say I desperately miss the black. I preferred the way it washed me out.”
	Oh I was wrong, he would get two pieces of personal information.
	It must be his lucky day.
	Except he would disappointingly not do anything with it. He may be smart, and now that I noticed the pins on his letter jacket weren’t all sports related but actually included some academic endeavors, I started to believe that maybe chemistry was an AP class last year, but he wouldn’t be smart enough for this game we were playing.
	And that was just disappointing. 
	He laughed, thinking I was joking and I sighed, hating that I was right about him. 
	We reached the top of the stairs. Finally…. that was seriously a long walk from Dodge Street upwards to the entrance. “Grrr” to my mother and her refusal to let me get a driver’s license. 
	She didn’t believe in driving, if you could believe that. Like driving was some weirdo religion. Or like you could actually choose not to believe in it.
	But she claimed that was what boys were for.
	Yep, I just threw up in my mouth.
	She was like the anti-feminist. She was sexist, but in the opposite way.
	I was still walking backwards, you know in that flirtatious way that only really coordinated girls can pull off, giving Chase my undivided attention and choosing to believe the busy hallways of the ancient and decrepit school would simply part for me. They did, with no doubt every single eye watching my every move.
	This was high school after all. And I was something of a legend….
	No, that wasn’t the right word. 
	Hot topic.
	I was something of a hot topic. 
	I was like the definition of notorious; famous but with negative connotations- very negative.
	Or at least I had been when I took my little six month sabbatical at the end of last year, over the summer and part of this year. I was banking on coming back, amping up the gossip mongers material and adding mystery to my ever growing nefarious reputation.
	“What’s your first class, Chase?” I asked as I slowed down near the office doors. 
	“Calculus,” he answered, slowing down with me.
	“Not slacking off in your last year? You must be undecided about good schools then,” I remarked, narrowing my eyes on him. 
	His cheeks reddened just a bit in response. 
	“What about you?” he asked while coming to a complete stop with me in front of the long set of glass windows sandwiching the door that led into the school office. 
	“I’m not sure yet,” I nodded in response to the office. The bell rang and he was officially late for class. Not that I thought he would mind. “I’ll see you around.” 
	“You’ll see me later,” Chase clarified boldly. “Ride home, remember?”
	“Oh, I remember,” I smiled coyly and then turned my back on him. 
	The glass door closed behind me with the tinkling of bells overhead and I visibly shivered against that interaction. Breathing deeply and counting to five again, I promised myself that the minute I graduated high school and had access to my trust fund I was so beyond out of here. 
	But the worst part, the part outside self-disgust and recrimination, outside the monotony and easy simplicity of all this was the guilt. The guilt that crept up slowly in the shadows of my heart and spread like a black sickness through my veins. 
	The only thing I knew about Chase at this point was that he was smart, good looking and way too easily impressed. Nothing about our interaction should have him enraptured by my every word, not even my looks, which were, unfortunately way too pretty for my own good. It so wasn’t his fault and I felt bad for that. 
	He didn’t really get a say. And I got absolutely no say. 
	In the end, I would leave him heartbroken and he would leave me shattered just like every single guy before him. 
	And believe me when I say there were a lot of guys before him.
	It was my job.

Chapter Two

“Ah, Ms. Pierce, I wish I could say I was happy to see you,” Mrs. Tanner, the evil witch of a secretary, acknowledged me with a smug smirk that seemed to confirm the fact that yes, in case you were wondering, high school is the ninth ring of hell.
“Oh, Mrs. Tanner, I wish I could say the same thing,” I replied as sweetly as I could. I met her halfway with a long counter in between us. 
She was not amused with me.
“You can’t miss anymore school Ivy,” Mrs. Tanner warned and I realized it was practically painful for her to give me advice to heed. This must be coming from the principal, the male principal Mr. Costas. “At least not this semester, unless you have a written note from your doctor. Mr. Costas would like to remind you that you are going to have to work hard enough to catch up this late in the quarter and that skipping, ditching or taking unnecessary sick days will not benefit you toward your goal of graduation.” 
“Tell Mr. Costas, I appreciate that he’s looking out for me,” I answered in that same sickly sweet voice I used to annoy the hell out of her.
She ignored me. “Here is your class schedule.” 
“Thank you.” I snatched it from her hand and turned on my heel before she offered any more unsolicited advice. 
“The faculty of this school would also like to ask that you not send any more of its students to the hospital,” she called out snidely to my back.
I tensed immediately, my back ramrod straight and my nerves shot to sudden hell. “I’ll do my best,” I ground out and picked up pace.
I just needed to get to the glass door, push it open and get to class.
Fifteen more seconds.
“If you have any extra cash on you, that canister by the door is for Sam’s recovery fund,” she finished on a high note.
I couldn’t help myself. I should have bolted, and not just from the office, from school, from Omaha, from America…. I should have just gone. 
But instead of listening to the sound voice of reason my inner conscience was screaming at me, I let the rotting guilt spread its ugly, vicious wings and glanced down at the canister. There he was. Sam. Smiling and happy in his senior picture that was not at all indicative of what he looked like now…..
The canister was covered with construction paper asking for donations to help with his physical therapy and explaining that he used to be a senior at this school, that he used to be a basketball star and that he used to be able to walk…. The same life he never got the chance to live before a car accident changed his world forever. The plastic cover had a slit cut out of the top so you could drop money into it, long enough for coins and wide enough for folded up dollar bills.
I couldn’t do this. 
I didn’t want to do this.
I felt my breakfast lurch in my very upset stomach. I lunged for the office door knowing even a second more spent trapped in the same room as that canister was going to send me into another breakdown.
Only this time there would be serious consequences to pay.
I threw the door open without seeing. I mean literally I couldn’t see anything. My mind had slipped into the horrific memories of the past and I was pretty sure I could make a solid plea for temporary insanity at this point.
So when I shoved the door with as much force as I was capable of and met shouting resistance and then found myself tripping, toppling over something on the floor, I was completely taken off guard. The situation was made worse when in the middle of my fall I was drenched with severely hot liquid and landed painfully on my back, soaking wet. 
I lay there for several moments sprawled out awkwardly on the hard tile before the clearest, deepest gray eyes I had ever seen hovered over me. His thick brow line and hard edges to his tanned face prove he was male, definitely male. Our gazes locked together and I felt uncomfortably immobilized as the liquid I could now identify as coffee started to cool on my shirt and against my skin. 
And then those eyes narrowed on me. My eyes flickered to a face that was completely unreadable, in that I couldn’t identify his expression except that it wasn’t good. Like…. he was mad at me. Like, he was pissed at me. 
“Let me up,” I growled, confused by his less than stellar reaction. 
“Excuse me?” he asked politely, schooling his expression and realistically sounding polite, like he hadn’t heard me correctly.
“Let me up,” I slowed my speech down, thinking he just hadn’t heard me, probably because he was so disconcerted from staring into my eyes.
I’m not being stuck up here. That’s just usually what happened. I was speaking from experience.
“No problem.” He scooted back from me and I scrambled to my feet. He joined me seconds later with two empty coffee cups in his hand. 
We both side-stepped the spilled coffee puddled in the hallway and I thought for a second that I heard him huff an impatient sigh, but I knew that had to be wrong. 
The halls were empty now, and we were left to stare each other down in front of the office. I prayed Mrs. Tanner had gone back to hiding in her hole of a break room; otherwise I needed to be concerned with her swooping down at any moment to haul my ass to the principal’s office. If I was lucky she would demand a detention, but more than likely she would be petitioning for a suspension. She would use this or any other thing she could find against me.
Like I assaulted gray eyes with his hot coffee in an attempt to end any promising future he might have. Like this would be related in some way to Sam.
	Realizing that could be the case, I looked down at my shirt hoping to have evidence that I was actually the one assaulted. And then hope turned to irritation when I noticed that it was completely ruined, and uncomfortably sticky and cold. Not that it was a designer shirt…. but the tight fitting, scoop neck black long-sleeved tee looked great with my gray bubble skirt and knee high charcoal boots. And the only extra piece of clothing I had with me was my favorite hoodie that I wasn’t supposed to wear. 
	“What am I going to do now?” I bit out, while mystery man watched me from a few feet away.
	“Excuse me?” he asked politely again, only this time I heard the faint tones of aggression and confusion.
	Not possible.
	“You spilled coffee all over me; I don’t have a change of clothes, what am I supposed to do for the rest of the day?” I asked not at all politely. 
	“I spilled coffee on you?” he asked slowly, his patience growing thin.
	I stopped then, in that moment and lifted my eyes to meet his again. He wasn’t looking at me though, his arms were crossed and he was looking around the hallway as if he couldn’t actually believe what was happening and he needed someone else to clue him in. I took his distracted second to look him over. 
	He was all bad boy with thick layered dark brown hair that was clearly not styled and left messy and sexy from sleep. He had the thick kind of eyelashes that made most girls go crazy, with tanned skin completely in contrast to his silver gray eyes. His gray t-shirt that was just a little too tight, stretched over his biceps deliciously. His low slung jeans completed what might as well have been the uniform for all things wicked.
	“Are you seriously going to blame me?” he asked in disbelief, drawing my attention away from the hollow of his throat.
	 “You spilled coffee on me,” I pointed out, pulling my shirt away from my skin mostly because it was so uncomfortable but also and a bit calculatingly because I knew it would expose my stomach and I was dying to see his reaction to a little skin.
	“You came flying out of the office like a bat out of hell and ran into me,” he laughed unbelievably. And not once did his eyes fall to my exposed skin. 
	“Listen, I don’t have time for this, I’m already late for class,” I ignored his potentially valid point and waited for the part where he would shake off his disbelief and ask for my number. 
	“You’re seriously unbelievable,” he continued to sound irritated with me and honestly it was a little disconcerting. 
	“Me?” I gasped. “You’re unbelievable!” 
	Only I really meant that. Something was wrong. Like maybe I was broken. 
	Maybe I was broken….? 
	I had to test this theory, which meant swallowing all of my pride. My entire life thus far had conditioned me to think that nothing was ever my fault and there was always someone else to blame. Usually a man. An apology would take some effort on my part. 
	“You are one snide little-”
	“Wait a second, before you start calling names,” I interrupted him, holding my hand up before he could get any naughty words out of that beautiful mouth of his. “You caught me way off guard. I may have been a little defensive,” I relented, not feeling a single word I was saying, but knowing if I wanted to get to the bottom of this I would have to play his game.
	“You are apologizing for being defensive?” he clarified, not looking at all pacified. 
	What the hell?
	“Yes, um, that and for running into you,” I mumbled in a rush.
	“What was that?” he stepped forward, tightening the arms that were folded across his chest. I knew he heard me…. cocky bastard.
	“I apologize for running into you, I was in a hurry,” I offered magnanimously. 
	“Obviously,” he narrowed his eyes on me again and rocked back on his heels. “It’s fine, I mean, you took most of the hit anyway.” He nodded to my stained shirt and that’s when I realized he was completely dry except for the hem of his t-shirt. 
	I hesitated for a long moment, feeling irrationally vulnerable under his scrutiny. Which wasn’t fair, because I was usually the one getting to do the scrutinizing. He looked me over for all of three more seconds before seeming to come to an indifferent conclusion.
	Which, let’s be honest, confused the hell out of me.
	“I can write you a pass,” he offered out of the blue. This was it! This was him showing his true colors! But his tone of voice was not anything like the doting, fawning boys I was used to. 
	“You can?” I squeaked while still feeling exposed for some strange reason.
	“I’m the office aide this hour, which is why I had coffee in the first place,” he motioned to the still wet ground. 
	“Oh.”
	“What’s your name?” he asked as if he didn’t know.
	“Really?” I laughed.
	His expression turned confused. “I can’t write you a pass without it.” 
	“Oh.” I couldn’t tell if he really didn’t know my name or not. He looked confused, but really I was the one that was so confused I couldn’t even make a sentence.
	“Uh, your name?” he asked impatiently. 
	“Ivy Pierce,” I struggled for confidence. Who was this guy? 
	“Come on Ivy, what class are you going to?” He motioned toward the office, but there was absolutely no way I was going back in there. Not to mention, the minute Mrs. Tanner figured out he was trying to help me out, she wouldn’t let him go through with it. And for some unexplainable reason I didn’t want to get in it with her in front of him. 
	Whoever he was.
	“Um, I have,” I gave my schedule a quick glance before answering, “Mr. Taylor for creative writing.” He motioned me to follow him so I had to call after him before the door swung shut, “I’ll just wait out here.” 
	He nodded his head without turning around to acknowledge me. Huh. He jumped up, so he could reach over the chest high partition and grabbed the yellow late slips before settling back down to the floor and filling it out. I watched him through the glass in kind of a state of disbelief. He hadn’t looked back at me, not even once.
	Obviously my self-confidence was used to more petting, but I had legitimate reasons to have always thought of myself as desired. I was desired- always. And it wasn’t something I liked or ever hardly tolerated, but still it was the truth. The male species as a whole couldn’t resist me and suddenly I smashed into someone I didn’t know, get splattered with hot coffee and my mojo was gone? 
	“Ivy Pierce?” a girl’s voice made me turn my head away from watching the mysterious office aide. 
	I turned to meet Kenna Lee as she approached the office. I forced a smile that I didn’t really mean and realized how hard it was to keep my focus on her. She was nice enough, or as nice as a girl could be around me and we had known each forever, but as far as friends went…. she didn’t like me. At all. 
	And I didn’t blame her.
	Plus it was hard to keep my eyes off the office aide writing me a pass. What if he turned to check me out and I missed it? Or even better, what if he never turned to check me out? 
	Kenna’s smile seemed halfway genuine though so I had to wonder if girls would also be affected by my loss of mojo. Maybe I would start making friends. 
	“When did you get back?” she asked. She was one of the more attractive girls in our junior class. Her dad was Japanese and her mom was Italian American so she had the good fortune of beautifully mixed genes with long, silky straight black hair, and pretty tilted eyes that were a shocking shade of green. 
	“Today is my first day,” I answered, wondering what to make of her friendliness. 
	“Good luck,” she smiled knowingly, but friendly enough.
	“Uh, thanks,” I mumbled while she left me in the hallway and entered the office.
	Office Boy turned at the sound of the door bells tinkling and his gray eyes lit up as soon as they landed on Kenna. He stopped writing my pass to pull her into his arms and smother her in a kiss. She threw her head back in laughter and he went for her neck playfully. 
	It was kind of gross, in that sickeningly gross happy couple way that makes everyone around want to vomit. Really blissful couples always made me uncomfortable anyway and I felt the need to avert my eyes.
	The office door opened again and a tan, long-fingered hand was thrust through the space. I followed the sinewy muscles up to a perfectly toned bicep along his shoulder, collarbone, and throat and up to those clear gunmetal eyes staring at me with nothing more than complete disinterest.
	“Sorry, again about the coffee,” I apologized more sincerely for that spill than I had anything else in my entire life. 
	Okay. Almost anything else.
	With one giant exception. 
	“No worries,” he replied without even a smile before the door was shut on me and he, whoever he was, went back to flirting with Kenna in the office.
	That was honestly a first for me.

Chapter Three

	After a mind numbing morning, I needed a break from the world of academia but could truthfully say I was not looking forward to lunch. Seriously, there was nothing more intimidating for a teenager than starting school well after everyone else and facing the death chamber known as the lunch room.
	And I was not even thinking about the food.
	I was pretty sure I would have preferred lethal injection.
	Or at least the lame therapy center my mom sent me to for recovery. Nobody judged you there at lunch. In fact, lunch usually came in the form of an assortment of rainbow colored pills in Dixie cups.
	Mmmm. Delicious.
	I had no friends at my school- none. Exie and Sloane, the only people in my life I could use that term even loosely with, went to private school. Why? Because their moms loved them. Well, maybe love was too strong of a word, but they cared more about their reputation than life experience, unlike my mom. 
I had nobody here. I mean there were guys I had dated, or used or whatever. But girls in general hated me and I usually tried to avoid all past relationships. Using ex-boyfriends for friendship instead of making out usually tended to confuse most guys and I didn’t have the patience to deal with that. 
	But I hated feeling intimidated and I hated it even more when I wasn’t brave enough to face my fears. So I took a deep breath and stepped into the stale smelling cafeteria and hoped for the best. 
	The best being me making it to the end of the period alive. 
	And with no more food spills or stains on my now pathetic outfit.
	I got in line immediately so I could scope out the room under the pretense of boredom and started filling up my tray with various healthy options, like an apple and bottled water. Lunch could not get more exciting than that….
	“Hey,” Chase came up behind me, startling me a bit. 
	“Hey,” I offered back and then resettled the bottle of water I had tipped over in my jumpiness. “So, that’s cool, we have lunch together.” 
	“Looks like it,” he smiled, his eyes twinkling with interest. 
	Ok… so my mojo still worked with him? I didn’t get it. 
	What was going on with the mystery-coffee-spilling office attendant then?
	“Where are you sitting?” I paid for my meager lunch, hating that I couldn’t stop eyeing the cheese fries. I mean they were products of a high school cafeteria; they were going to be awful. Still… they didn’t look awful, they didn’t smell awful and they’re nearly neon yellow processed cheese topping practically had my mouth drooling. 
	“Is that all you’re getting?” Chase looked down at my mostly empty tray. 
	“Uh, no?” I gave into the cravings that were haunting me and grabbed a granola bar without paying for it as I followed him through the lunchroom. It wasn’t cheese fries, but I hoped it would at least tide me over until dinner. It would be just me and my mom tonight so I had a super yummy bare as could be salad to look forward to. 
	Yum. Lettuce.
	A fresh wave of utter hatred for my life washed over me. 
	And in a new form of self-loathing masochism I gave one last longing glance back at the cheese fries. 
	“I’m over here,” Chase called, pulling my attention from the greasy, fattening food I wasn’t allowed within smelling distance of. 
	Exie and Sloane were so much better at not missing junk food than me. But ever since I hit puberty and had to give up virtually anything that couldn’t be bought in a hundred calorie snack pack, I decided my very first purchase with my trust fund would be a candy bar. Okay, probably it would be a plane ticket, but then definitely a candy bar.
	Maybe two. 
	I was awesome at dreaming big. 
	I followed Chase to his table, nearly groaning at how many girls were sitting near or around him. This was going to be an interesting lunch. 
	We wedged in between two of his friends. I knew they were friends because of the guy fist pump thing they did when we approached and how they scooted out of his way so we could sit down on the narrow bench seat. 
	“Ivy Pierce?” The guy sitting next to me asked all surprised and shocked. 
	“Yep,” I nodded, peeling open the wrapper of my granola bar. I realized then that if the entire table kept staring at me like that I wasn’t going to be able to eat any of my lunch. Damn it. 
	“I didn’t think you were coming back, like ever,” he so eloquently explained his disbelief.
	“Well, I’m here,” I clarified shyly. 
	I was not shy. Actually the farthest thing from shy, but along with the feral attraction the boys at this table were watching me with was a mixture of astonishment and confusion. It was super distressing and I kind of just wanted to find a quiet place and die. 
	That wasn’t too much to ask for was it? 
	“So they wouldn’t let you transfer to another district?” A snotty girl from across the table asked innocently. I knew boys, but I knew mean girls better and this girl had an agenda. Her overly big brown eyes watched me with excited anticipation and I could almost feel her punch line hanging in the air. 
	I just shook my head. 
	“Oh, they didn’t want you either, then,” she sighed with mock sympathy. The girls around her tittered away their approval of her joke and I shrunk into Chase, using him as a shield against the open hostility. 
	Last year I would have snapped back with something that was both witty and cruel. I would have easily put her in her place by simultaneously hacking away at whatever façade of self-esteem she had and planted seeds of doubt that would plague her for years to come. I would have shut off every emotion and trickle of potential guilt and acted in a way I was raised to. I would have made my mother proud.
 But since nowadays I could barely look at myself in the mirror, I had nothing for Amber. I couldn’t even level her with one of my death glares. She was right after all; no other district would let me transfer into their school. Not even my mom’s own power of persuasion could get me in. I mean, that was a lot of fear and rejection.
	“Geez, Amber,” Chase muttered disapprovingly at my persecutor. 
	“What? It’s the truth,” Amber narrowed her eyes on me. She was really pretty with her short, rich brown bob with red highlights. Her face was pixie-like with a cute nose and full lips underneath her huge eyes. She was definitely pretty enough to get all the attention of the boys at this table. She shouldn’t have had to fight me for it anyway.
	But she did.
	We both knew it.
	Only I was the only one who knew why.
	“I’m sorry about my rude friend,” Chase sighed, shooting Amber a look. Her eyes narrowed infinitesimally more and I recognized the pain she was trying to cover up. 
	She liked him.
	“It’s alright, she’s right.” I had to stop with the pity party or I would never be able to keep my stone-cold-bitch rep up. I went through the routine I always did, the one where I stripped away my real feelings and replaced everything about me with what was expected of me. I sat up straighter, and pulled my wavy red hair over my shoulder where I knew it would look the most attractive, I put on an amused smile and then laughed. “Guess you guys are stuck with me.”
	That was met with a murmured chorus of “We don’t mind,” from the guys around me. 
	Amber did not like that and with a snort of disgust, got up from the lunch table followed by her posse of high school socialites.
	“She’s kind of annoying, right?” a guy from across the table asked. 
	I shrugged in response, but his amused tone made me lift my eyes to meet his and when I did I almost audibly sighed. He was one of those adorable kind of high school boys with curly, way too long shiny brown hair and a once-upon-a-time broken nose. He was scrawnier than most of the guys around me and endearingly disheveled. 
	On closer inspection, he was less scrawny and more…. gangly. Like really long and lanky, which was my favorite type of guy, but only because they always seemed so cartoonish and I was oddly fascinated by very tall people. 
	“When did you get back?” tall guy asked casually.
	Chase shifted next to me. This was an uncomfortable road we were about to walk down, he probably didn’t want his friend pissing me off and ruining his chances with me. If only he knew he had absolutely nothing to worry about. 
	“Uh, yesterday,” I mumbled. 
	“Whoa, and you’re already in school?” tall guy blurted in disbelief. “I would think you should get at least the rest of the week off.” 
	I laughed at his nonchalance about the whole thing. Good for him. “I’m pretty sure this is just all part of my mom’s never-ending scheme to punish me until the day I die.”
	“Ah, I have parents like that,” tall guy nodded knowingly.
	“I doubt they’re as bad as mine,” I sighed. 
	“Really? My name is Phoenix,” he laughed and the rest of the guys around him laughed too.
	“Phoenix?” I smiled. He was kind of contagious.
	“Yep. Phoenix. They’re total hippies. My little sisters have it worse than me; their names are Sparrow and Wren. But the baby, as in the newborn baby my forty year old parents conceived and then birthed… at home…. In the bathtub…. they named him Buzzard.” 
	I gasped loudly. It couldn’t be helped. “No they did not!” 
	He just nodded, laughing at my reaction. “It’s true. My sisters and I have already decided we are only ever calling him Buzz, but still, can you imagine my hippy mom with her dreadlocks and marijuana perfume chasing after him in the grocery store wearing all of her hemp clothes yelling ‘Buzzard you get over here!’” 
	I giggled at his story- giggled. The sounds felt strange and jumpy in my chest, but still they flowed out, exercising my ribs in a way that had been atrophied for way too long.
	“I can totally see your mom doing that too,” Chase laughed with me. His hand had slipped to my lower back as if protecting me from falling backward off the slim bench.
	“You’re right,” I gasped for air, this time in a good way, “six months of banishment and public school hardly seem bad at all compared to a lifetime of Buzzard.”
	“So you see my point,” Phoenix nodded.
	“Where were you banished to?” the guy next to me asked. 
	“Uh….” I stuttered. I was prepared to not deny rumors, but I hadn’t exactly prepared myself to come up with my own explanation. “Rehab,” I choked out in a lie. 
	“Really?” He couldn’t stop himself from the shock and I couldn’t blame him.
	“Yep,” I looked away, not wanting to meet his eyes. 
	I felt him shift toward me on the bench. Oh no, he was going to ask more questions. 
	And then I felt the cool gray eyes of the mystery guy on me. I couldn’t explain how I felt his stare before I saw him approach the table, it wasn’t like we had a connection of any kind or I knew him at all. But then Kenna’s laughter floated through the air and drew my attention before I could stop myself. 
	They were joining us. His arms were wrapped around her waist and she was looking up at him, laughing with careless grace at something he had said. She rose up on her tip toes and pressed a sweet kiss to his jawline before taking her seat next to Phoenix. Mystery guy followed suit and since I could apparently not stop watching the two of them interact, his cold gray eyes found mine in a look of disgust? Or maybe pissed off disbelief? 
	Please let it be something neutral like just surprise. 
	Ugh. I shouldn’t care either way.
	“Ryder, what is up?” Chase asked next to me, all happy smiles and friendliness. 
	“Same,” he shot back. 
	He was pissed. Damn it and it was because of me. Seconds ago Kenna had his face lit up like a freaking Christmas tree. One look at me and all happiness faded from the room.
	What is up with him?
	“Who’s your friend, Chase?” Ryder nodded in my direction and I gulped back more of those irrational fears.
	“Ryder this is Ivy. Ivy Pierce, Ryder Sutton and his lovely girlfriend Kenna Lee,” Chase offered politely. “With the exception of the lovely Kenna, no offense,” he nodded to Kenna and she just shook her head at him, “we are every important part of the soccer team. “Keeper,” he pointed to Phoenix. “Striker,” he pointed to himself. “Midfield,” he finished with Ryder. 
	“I know Kenna,” I said quickly before things got even more awkward.
	“Didn’t you guys meet this morning?” Kenna asked, her pretty slanted eyes narrowing on me cautiously. 
	“Uh, not formally,” I practically whispered. Ryder hadn’t taken his cool gaze off me and I felt like I was shrinking under the weight of it. But there was no attraction there, no undressing me with his eyes or even less than admirable thoughts floating around in their gunmetal depths. 
	“I dumped my coffee on her this morning,” Ryder explained with a small sarcastic twist to his lips. “I, unfortunately, tried to tie-dye her shirt the color of coffee and French Vanilla creamer.” 
	I sat stunned, frozen by this sudden inside joke we shared. Luckily Kenna interrupted with an inside joke of her own, “Mrs. Tanner’s fave.” 
	Ryder broke his gaze with me immediately to stare into his loyal girlfriend’s eyes. They shared a secret laugh and the hollowness inside me spread from the hole in my heart to my fingertips. 
	“How’s your first day back?” Kenna asked politely. I knew she didn’t like me. She couldn’t like me. But she was a nice enough girl to pretend in front of other people. 
	“Same,” I sighed. I felt like I was folding into myself, becoming my own version of a black hole. Soon I would be completely sucked into the void of darkness that was my soul, pulling in everything and anything around me. 
	Guy next to me felt like this was a perfect opportunity to jump back into our earlier conversation. “So what was the stint in rehab for anyway?” 
	Classy. 
	All conversation stopped at our table and every eye slid cautiously to me. This was a lie. This was a lie. I wasn’t an addict, except to maybe hope. Yes, I was only addicted to hope for life after my eighteenth birthday. 
	“Everything,” I muttered. I didn’t feel up to the task of picking out one of the many reasons to go to rehab. I had lots of vices; I didn’t want to give any one of them up just to prove a fake addiction. “Seriously, you name it.” 
	The table was quiet for six entire seconds as the heavy information sank into all those around me. 
	“Sex,” Ryder said clearly in the wake of the awkward silence.
	“What?” I sputtered. 
	“Sex, were you addicted to sex?” he clarified. He settled his gray eyes on me again, their depths becoming pools of liquid silver. But still, he was mocking me, calling my bluff. There was nothing sparking in the air between us and I couldn’t help but be intrigued. What was different about him? Why wasn’t he pulled into the same bullshit every other man on the planet had to suffer from? 
	“Absolutely,” I sat up straighter, my confidence gaining with each moment he held my gaze. “But I refused treatment; I prefer to live in denial.” I laughed.
	“You’re basically like the female version of Tiger Woods,” Ryder stated but his eyes danced with amusement.
	“Exactly,” I nodded, offering him an amused smile that lacked any of its usual flirtatious traps. “But it’s my cross to carry.”
	“Nuh-uh,” guy next to me grunted in complete disbelief, like I was the holy grail of damaged daddy issues. He scooted closer to me on the bench and I couldn’t help myself, I clung to Chase. I was destined to this sort of depraved, user lifestyle, but nothing could make me willingly give myself over to creepers. I had standards.
	Not very many standards….
	But there were some levels of crazy I just couldn’t mess with.
	“Back off, Hayden, she’s not serious,” Chase barked at him. I was really beginning to like Chase. He tossed his floppy hair out of his eyes in disgust and then turned his deep blue eyes on his friend. “And it’s disgusting that you would be attracted to somebody else’s real problems.” 
	“I’m just messing around, man,” Hayden laughed. “I wasn’t serious either.”
	“Right,” Chase rolled his eyes and his hand went from my lower back to all the way around my back. 
	He was strong and protective and I melted into him. But it was all fake. He was under a spell, nothing more. This would fade….
	And I would be left with an attachment that meant nothing. 
	“Hey, want to go with me to the Biology Lab? I have to drop off some extra credit,” Chase leaned in so he could ask me quietly. He held my gaze in his searching blue eyes, looking for something, making sure I was okay.
	“Yes please,” I whispered, trying to show him that I was fine. I wasn’t. I wasn’t anywhere close to being fine, but it didn’t really have anything to do with sleazy Hayden or even the fact that I had been sent away for treatment, just not of the addictive-behavioral type. 
	It did have a lot to do with the behind the scenes of my life, the ones that nobody could see, the ones that hurt and cut the deepest and screwed me up until I was a walking disaster of bipolar emotions and feminine insecurities. 
	But mostly it had everything to do with the gray eyes staring at me across the table like they knew me, like they saw through all of the pretty façade of my life and cut to the empty, lost part of me. But most of all it had to do with the fact that he saw me; Ryder saw me and didn’t care.
	What the hell was I supposed to do with that?
	I followed Chase from the lunch room, letting him lead me by the hand and I decided that I had to find out. Even if it meant that eventually I would turn on the glamour and he would be sucked in just like everybody else and all of his appeal would crumble around him…. still, I had to know.

Chapter Four

	“Ivy, is that you?” My mother called from her bedroom. 
	“Yes,” I called back wondering if she was expecting someone else. I walked over to the windows that looked out at the busy downtown street and watched Chase pull back into traffic. I half wondered what had taken him so long to leave. I lived with my mom in a trendy midtown loft and because of the busy one way streets, Chase couldn’t park and walk me to the door as he had originally planned.
	That was fine with me. We weren’t on a date; he was just taking me home from school. Although I wondered if my nonchalance about the whole thing hurt his good-boy ego. The stress of that thought had me glancing at the cherry wood upright piano that sat three feet to my left, pleading with me to play it. To take out my nervous energy on the ivory keys and unforgiving demands of Tchaikovsky. 
	“How was your first day back?” My mother asked as she walked out of her bedroom. She looked stunning in a short black cocktail dress and six inch stilettos. She was fastening a diamond chandelier earring with two well-manicured hands and perfected the concept of elegance. 
	“It sucked,” I sighed and then turned my back on her. 
	I walked over to our immaculate eat-in kitchen and grabbed a bottle of water out of the stainless steel fridge. I noticed a note on the counter from the cleaning lady and had to grip the counter to keep from rolling my eyes. I hated everything about this apartment, about our clothes, about our possessions…. about our lifestyle. 
	It was honestly disgusting. 
	“Ivy, ladies don’t say ‘sucked,’” my mother chastised. 
	“I apologize,” I mumbled. I forced myself to turn around and face her. It took a huge effort on my part and an even greater effort to look in her forest green eyes without cowering. I was her spitting image, it was our strong genes that kind of took over any mixing of DNA and molded us into replicas of each other. One day if I had a daughter of my own she would be just another carbon copy of me. Good thing I would never, ever, ever have children. That was so not in my life plan. 
	“So, tell me about your first day back,” my mother asked with way too much enthusiasm. 
	“Why are you so dressed up?” I deflected. We were supposed to have dinner together tonight. I wouldn’t be all that upset about the loss of mother-daughter bonding time, but I was terrified for whatever man had to put up with my mother for the rest of the evening. 
	And possibly through the morning.
	“Oh, right,” my mother sighed looking down at her ensemble as if she just realized how dressed up she was. Her eyes darted around the room never quite reaching my face. “Uh, Nix is in town. He has some sort of business thing tonight and we’re going to dinner first.” 
	My fingers found the edge of the granite counter again and I instinctively dug in, gripping it tightly until the pads of my fingers started to tingle with numbness. I concentrated on my breathing, steadying my ragged breaths and forcing myself to remain calm. I had to remain aloof; I needed to keep the perfect disguise of cool indifference. I couldn’t let her see my fear, or my anxiety, or any of the other hundreds of emotions spinning like a self-destructive tornado inside me. 
	“Are you meeting him somewhere or is he coming here?” I ground out, barely keeping the bite of anger out of my tone.
	“He’s coming here,” my mother said slowly. She was watching me carefully, her eyes sweeping the length of me, waiting for me to fall apart again. 
	But I would never fall apart again.
	I learned my lesson the first time. I couldn’t be real anymore. I couldn’t show anything beyond the plastic casing I wrapped myself tightly in or they would know; they would see something immediately. 
	And I would have to pay. 
	Eighteen. Trust fund. Two years. Breathe. Just breathe. 
	“He wants to see you,” my mother continued. Her smiled tightened just a fraction into a practiced ease that meant that she felt the volatility of the moment as acutely as I did. 
	“Good,” I breathed carelessly. “I want to see him too.” 
	My stomach started twisting in the aftereffects of my lies. I felt lightheaded and dangerously close to trembling. I could not let her see me struggle for calm. She had to believe I was relaxed, or at least as resigned to the situation as she told me I had to be. 
	“Good,” she smiled wider, her expression becoming natural once again. 
	The twisting got worse until bile was rising in the back of my throat. I turned my back on her, my fingers instantly finding the counter again and digging in until the edge cut into my skin and I could have winced from the pain. 
	“Why don’t you change then, he shouldn’t see you so…. disheveled,” she remarked callously. “What did you do? Spill on yourself today? I saw a boy drop you off earlier, I’m surprised he took any interest while you looked like that.” 
	I held in my gasp of indignation. It was just my shirt, my dark shirt that barely showed any signs of stains, that was ruined. Something in the room was slowly sucking out all of the oxygen leaving me lightheaded and disoriented. 
	I gasped for breath. 
	I needed to hold it together. 
	I couldn’t lose it.
	Not again.
	“I spilled coffee,” I explained in my practiced patience. “I’ll go change. When will he be here?”
	“Soon, sweetie. Why don’t you wear that new red dress I bought you?” she suggested. 
	I paused for a moment near tears. “I don’t have to go with you, do I? I’m just really tired from school today and I have a lot to catch up on from the quarter that I’ve missed so far.” 
	“Oh, no, you’re not going with us. I just know Nix would appreciate it if you put some effort into yourself when you’re around him,” she explained like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
	She was my mother. My mother. Why was this okay to her? Why couldn’t she see how wrong this was?
	A million different responses flashed in my head, all of them intending to get me into trouble. “You’re right,” is what I said instead. “I’ll go change now.” 
	“Ivy,” she stopped me before I could get to the sanctuary of my bedroom. I turned to acknowledge her and faked a yawn, just in case she noticed the glassiness to my now tear filled eyes. “I’m glad you’re home, sweetheart. I missed you.”
	“I’m glad to be home too, mom,” I answered, avoiding any accolade that had to do with her.
	She rewarded me with her most charming smile, the one that would get millionaires to sign their wills with her as the sole beneficiary and make ordinary men melt into whimpering piles of stupidity. I mimicked the smile, knowing I looked like the mirror image of her and that it would on some level, drive her crazy.
	The buzzer sounding near the door drew both of our attention. She waved me off to go get ready while she answered the door. I fled to my bedroom, not even waiting around to find out who was there.
	I knew who it was.
	Nix.
	A shudder slithered down my spine; I felt it all the way to my toes and fingertips. I stopped from choking on the disgusted nausea that had wrapped around my stomach in a heavy blanket of warning and reminded myself that they were leaving. 
	This interaction would only last a minute, maybe a few minutes and then I would have the entire evening to myself. I would finally get to be alone and have precious moments to breathe. 
	I could do this. 
	I heard the door open outside of my room and the deep tones of a melodic male voice greet my mother. The voice had goose bumps rising quickly all over my skin in more forewarning. I shook my head out in a desperate attempt to get out of the fearful fog I had conjured around me. 
I walked over to my closet and stared into the depths of cluttered clothing packed in tightly together. There was no way I was putting on the paper napkin my mother considered a dress. I needed something in between mega-slut and carelessly cute.
	I threw myself into finding the perfect outfit. It wasn’t something I enjoyed doing, but after years of studying the art of dressing to impress, it was something I could do almost blindfolded. I picked through my massive closet that took up an entire wall of my large bedroom, tossing several pieces on my four poster queen-sized bed. 
	When I was satisfied with a few different options, I laid them out carefully on my robin’s egg colored down comforter and decided from there. I went through the checklist before I came to my conclusion: spray tan, check; shaved legs, check; pedicure, check; tattoo concealer…. probably needed a touch up.
	I settled on a pair of mostly white with black pinstripes shorts and a silky black cami: sexy but casual. I pulled my wavy reddish-gold hair into a side ponytail, letting the length of it hang over my shoulder and expose my neck. Then I reached into the deepest depths of my closet, into a mostly empty Louboutin shoe box where I retrieved my tattoo concealer.  I applied it on the inside of my right wrist and then on my ribs, underneath my cami just in case.
	I shivered again at what “just in case” could imply. 
	I looked myself over in my mirror, deciding that everything was in place and then returned the concealer to its hiding place. I practiced breathing with several deep breaths in and out and then turned to face my doorway. I could hear them out there, laughing and talking. They were so at ease with each other, with their whole lives.
	It was insane. 
	They were insane.
	And I was insane for putting up with this whole bullshit life. 
	I opened my door quietly, hoping they wouldn’t immediately notice me, but I was an idiot for holding out any kind of optimism. Their eyes fell on me at the exact same time and I had to stop breathing completely to keep from cringing as they both eyed me hungrily. My mother’s gaze was deranged pride and satisfaction and Nix looked me over with a ravenous desire he didn’t even try to conceal or downplay.
	“Hi, Nix,” I greeted casually, leaning my hip against the doorway. 
	“Hi, Ivy,” his perfect lips spread into a gorgeous smile that even I couldn’t be totally unaffected by. But it was part of his charm, part of what made him who he was and even if physically I couldn’t stop myself from being attracted to his sexy-as-sin mouth, I could at least mentally remind myself of the price it came with. “Happy to be home?”
	“Of course,” I shrugged one shoulder and then walked over to the couch just for something to do. 
	“Ava, why don’t you go check the account we were just talking about,” Nix addressed my mother. She paused for a moment too long, as if waiting for a better reason to leave the room. “We’ll leave as soon as you’re finished.” Nix turned his reassuring smile on my mother and lifted his dark eyebrows expectantly. 
	“Of course,” she agreed, obeying him. There had never been any doubt in my mind that she wouldn’t do exactly as she was told. She lived a complete subservient life, in the utter will and command of Nix. The same life I was supposed to embrace and walk willingly into, as well. 
	Not happening.
	Eighteen. Eighteen. Eighteen. Eighteen.
	Once she was gone, Nix walked over to the couch. I fought the defensive surge to pull my knees to my chest, knowing it would give away the physical signs of needing to protect myself and crossed my legs instead. Nix let his dark eyes float over my exposed limbs appreciatively; he cleared his throat letting his gaze linger way too long on my thighs. I resisted the urge to fidget when his eyes moved to my hands. He couldn’t see the tattoo; I had checked it out enough to know that it was perfectly hidden. Still there was a part of me that believed he could see through anything. 
	He was just a man. Nothing more. Nothing more than a man.
	Okay, maybe something more. 
	“How was your first day back?” he asked, his deep, gravelly voice caressed each word and floated in the air around me like music. He looked god-like in his immaculately tailored navy blue suit, with starched white oxford and red charcoal tie. His tan skin was the exact color of caramel and because I was crazy I stopped to notice how delicious his large hands looked hanging casually at his sides. 
	“Same as it always is,” I answered, not fooled at all by the cocoon of safety he was trying to wrap me in.
	He was not safe. He was not anything but absolutely dangerous. 
	He sat down on the chic, mustard colored coffee table in front of me and rested his elbows on his knees so that he could lean forward and meet my eyes at an even level. He let his fingers trail up my bare calf before he reached for one of my hands and took it gently in his. I couldn’t hide the goose bumps that covered my skin, all I could do was hope that he thought they were good goose bumps and not the result of the paralyzing fear pumping desperately inside of me. 
	“Ivy, I am happy you’re home,” he admitted. He ducked his head as if with sincerity before looking up at me through his thick, black eyelashes. It was a practiced move, a move meant to make any girl puddle at his every word. I was not fooled, but I had to be somewhat sneaky about it. “I was so worried about you. You can’t do that to me again, alright? I need to know that you will be okay, here. If you don’t think this is a good environment for you, or if you feel even a little bit like you could relapse I need you to tell me.”
	“Thank you, Nix,” I answered in a barely controlled voice. “But, I’m fine, really. I’m happy to be home with my mom again. She needs me.”
	He sat there pensively for a few moments, drinking in my answer. His eyes darkened suddenly and I couldn’t stop myself from wondering if it were from lust or anger. I hoped anger, but flipping a coin would have given me more insight than trying to read his expression.  
	“But what about what I need?” Nix asked playfully. His full lips tipped up into a smile and small creases appeared near his eyes, making it seem like he was a regularly happy person, that a smile was part of his constant facial expressions. 
	I swallowed quickly, my throat working overtime to keep from puking. I buried whatever thoughts sounded like What about what I need?      
	“Nix, I’m only sixteen,” I chastised playfully. Where was my mother? 
	“Now, now, that’s not what I meant,” he backtracked when we both knew that was exactly what he meant. But I wasn’t his property. Not yet. “I only meant that I’m very concerned about your well-being. I understand that your mother can’t leave Omaha, but you aren’t under the same obligations. I need to know that you’re safe, that you’re well taken care of and that you’re protected.” 
	“I am,” I assured him.
	“I know that you think you are, but let’s not forget what happened just six months ago. I could have lost you Ivy. Do you know what that has done to me?” His expression seemed so sincere and if I were a weaker woman I would have melted in the intensity of his feelings for me. It didn’t matter how old he really was, he looked like he was maybe mid-thirties. 
	“I can’t apologize enough for my stupidity,” I threw myself into this moment as a character in a tragic play. I had to convince Nix, my mother…. I had to convince everyone. And I would do whatever it took to get out of here. If Nix took me to live with him, I would never see freedom, never see my trust fund. I had to push through the fear and vile hatred coiling inside of me and just pretend. I scooted to the edge of the couch and slipped my other hand in his. I rubbed my thumb nail across the inside of his wrist slowly and gently, a move that usually got me anything I wanted with men. “I was confused and not thinking right. I won’t ever let that happen again…. I won’t ever behave like that again.” I shrugged one of my shoulders, hopefully drawing attention to the curve of my neck and collarbone and then used his own trick against him by looking up through my lashes. 
	“Promise me, Ivy,” Nix whispered through a thick voice. “Promise me you won’t ever get like that again and if you even think you might be slipping you’ll come to me immediately.”
	“I promise,” I responded with enough sincerity that even I almost believed I was telling the truth.  	
	“Mmmm, good girl,” Nix murmured, his gaze settling on my lips. He leaned forward and I sucked in a quiet gasp, preparing for his touch. One of his hands lifted to cup my chin and he tilted my mouth upwards to meet his sensual lips. He kissed me lightly, gently, his lips never opening but lingering a little longer than I could stand. 
	When my thumb slipped out of nervousness and grazed over his wrist one more time, he groaned against me. His hand gripped my neck firmer and even though he pulled away instead of deepening the kiss I knew it took all of his willpower. 
	“You’re exquisite,” he whispered. “And if I didn’t love your mother as much as I do, I would demand you come live with me right now.” 
	Well, at least I could thank my mother for something.
	He laughed gruffly as if he were trying to gain his composure and then stood up and moved away from me. I bit down on my bottom lip to keep from saying anything that would get me into trouble and slid back into the deep recesses of the couch.
	My mother came out of her bedroom wearing a designer coat over her designer dress and a beaded clutch in hand. She gave me an excited smile after glancing at Nix as if I had just won some kind of championship game. 
	I broke out in a cold sweat. 
	“I’ll be in town for a while,” Nix told me, his eyes still smoldering. “Do you already have a date for this weekend or will I be able to take you out one night?” 
	“I, uh, I,” I stammered, loathing the idea of a night out with him. “I met a guy today; he gave me a ride home from school. We don’t have anything set up, but I’m positive he’ll ask me out this weekend.” 
	“Good,” Nix murmured and I could see the confliction in his eyes. He was happy there was a boy but disappointed all the same. “Maybe Sunday, then?”
	“Maybe,” I answered noncommittally. “Will you be back tonight?” I turned to my mom.
	She looked to Nix for the answer, he shook his head negatively. “I guess not,” she giggled. “Will you be Okay?” 
	“I’ll be fine, have a great time,” I gushed, so ready for them to be gone. 
	“Alright, bye sweetheart,” my mom walked over and kissed me on the forehead. 
	“Goodbye, Ivy,” Nix’s eyes swept over me appreciatively one more time and then he winked at me. 
	I waved from the couch and then held my breath until the door clicked shut behind them. As soon as they were gone I leapt from the couch and rushed to the bathroom. I barely made it to the toilet before I started vomiting up every single thing I ate today, which wasn’t all that much. I shuddered even against the violent heaving as I emptied my stomach. 
	When I was finished I sunk to the floor, leaning my back against the bathroom wall. 
	Two years might as well have been an eternity. If I had to put up with too much more of this, I would never make it. I would crumble… shatter… I would explode into the million broken pieces I already felt like composed me. I was already wrecked. Completely fragmented and I wasn’t foolish enough to believe that freedom would fix me. 
	But it would let me breathe.
	And that’s all I needed. I just needed to breathe.

Chapter Five

	They were gone for ten minutes before I let myself move. I had to be sure they were gone. I had to know they weren’t coming back and I was free to do as I pleased. 
	So when I was sure, I tore from the bathroom floor and ran to my room. It was still early in the evening, but Wednesdays were a bit of a ritual night for me and since I would be taking the bus I needed to get my ass moving. 
	In my room, I changed again. I was in what I called my “Mom-approved-skanky-casual.” This included nice, expensive clothes that were at the same time subtly revealing and not at all age appropriate. I was a sixteen year old girl that rarely got to act sixteen except on Wednesday nights when I was in Omaha. And this was my first Wednesday back in over six months. 
	I ripped of my cami and shorts and shot to the very depths of my closet, the depths on the opposite side of my tattoo cover up, because both secrets were very closely tied to my heart and I couldn’t have one giving away the other, just in case of worst-case-scenario-secret-exposing-Armageddon.
	Which was obviously the worst kind of Armageddon.
	And could happen at any time, day or night.
	People get ready.
	I pulled from the bowels of my clothing sanctuary the most depressing, most soul-baring, most emo clothes I had been able to stash away over time and grinned like an idiot. I peeled, tugged, yanked and scooched my tightest black, faded skinny jeans on and paired them with depressingly worn out Chucks. 
They were worn out because, in my entire short-lived life, I had only ever had one opportunity to sneak a pair of black and white Chuck Taylors into my wardrobe. And I knew, without a doubt, if something ever happened to them I would never get that opportunity again. 
I pulled on a faded to gray Johnny Cash t-shirt and inhaled the musty smell that came with being tucked into a hole in my closet for too long. And then to finish my glorious ensemble, I zipped up my plain black hoodie. I almost squealed with delight. A hoodie. A freaking hoodie! 
	It had been six months since I’d been able to wear something as comfortable as a hoodie.
	I always carried one around with me in my backpack, but I never wore it. It was like a security blanket for me. And maybe something more, something like the Promised Land.    
	I pulled a hair-tie off my vanity and wrapped my hair into a knot on the top of my head. I darkened my eye-liner to Goth-gorgeous and painted on some bright red lipstick. I stepped back so I could approve of my look in the full-length mirror.
	Then I really did squeal. 
	If I had complete freedom, as in the ability to choose small aspects of my life without having to answer to anyone other than myself, this would not be the wardrobe I would choose. I wasn’t some closet monochromatic safe dresser or even someone that belonged in a Goth sub-culture, but I also wasn’t the glamorous uber skank I usually dressed up as either. I was somewhere in between. 
	And in my daydreams and all the thoughts I had that centered around two years from now, I pictured myself one day having the opportunity to discover and explore what my real tastes and opinions were. I could not wait to try something on in the dressing room, decide I looked great only to hate it the minute I got home. Then, in these pipe dreams, I would complain about having to return it, go to the store anyway and purchase something as equally unflattering. Rinse and repeat. 
	As it stood now, I didn’t get to choose my wardrobe. I barely got a say in what I wore on a day to day basis. And then I very secretly rebelled by going in the exact opposite way I lived my everyday life just because it was rebellion. I had no attachment to these clothes other than memories of concerts made of horrible music and boys not giving me even a second glance. I didn’t care for the way the pants clung to me and when I got sweaty they really clung to me, the shoes were well beyond their good years, hell they were way beyond retirement and my t-shirt and hoodie were just meh. But they were something my mother and Nix would disgust and even possibly not even recognize me in. And even better they made me feel, even if it was just for one night…. they made me feel alive.
	And I desperately needed to feel alive. 
	Because if I didn’t feel alive, then I would feel…. dead.
	And dead was unacceptable, because dead would mean giving up hope.
	I shook my head to free myself of those thoughts and grabbed my ID, my regular, real school ID, not the fake ID from Nix, and a wad of cash and stuffed it all into my pocket. Yep, not even a purse. And then I took off for the long journey across downtown Omaha to NoDo, North downtown, via bus for my Wednesday night ritual. 

----

	The sleek, trendy concert hall was packed with bodies, both underage and of-age. Partly because Wednesday nights were huge at the Slowdown with the under twenty-one crowd and also because the main stage was curtained off and the band was positioned at the back of the room on a mini-stage. 
Sweat, beer and the faintest hint of weed wafted through the air. The space was almost completely dark, with every overhead light in the exposed ceiling turned off. Only the stage lights and dim bar lights over a large selection of alcohol illuminated the room. Tables were spread out in between the t-shirt stands in the back and the space in front of the stage where standing fans congregated. Board games were stacked unceremoniously on a cluttered bookcase near the front door and the stairs leading to the balcony were roped off. Welcome to the Slowdown. 
 The opening band was blasting on stage, their drums beating so loudly my heart was forced to keep quick rhythm and I felt the reverberation of the bass guitar to my very bones. I didn’t know their name, and really I didn’t need to. I just wanted to sport my under twenty-one wrist band that declared under no circumstances should I be served alcohol, even though the bouncer tried to convince me I looked twenty-one and would totally get away with a real wrist band…. come on…. what will it hurt?
His words not mine.
I said, “It will hurt me, damn it! I will obviously drink cheap tequila until I’m obliterated, then leave with some random, way-too-old-for-me-stranger, get knocked up, get into a drunk-driving accident and then I will die! And then you will be responsible for the death of a sixteen year old minor! Damn it!”
My exact words.
Then he shrunk back on his stool and gulped, “Sixteen?”
And then I walked into the music hall completely satisfied with how that went down. 
Despite my aversion to certain libations tonight, I was still thirsty after two and a half hours on and/or waiting for various public transportation. So I pushed my way through the pressing crowd and to the bar. In the trek over I had to weave through lots and lots of bodies and then in order to get a place at the bar I had to stand near the back of the room where the t-shirts were being sold, and elbow my wait to the chest-high counter.
I didn’t mind it back here. The air was fresher and cooler and it was decidedly less populated since most of the crowd was currently trying to press into one solidified organism, like the human centipede, against the stage. It wasn’t going to work, but there was no use telling that to them. 
“Water!” I yelled when I caught the bartender’s attention. He gave me a questioning look so I waved my wristband his way and he nodded in a disappointed but resigned way. 
Once upon a time, before I could hold my liquor, Nix had taught me to order a Blue Dolphin when at a bar, which was essentially water on the rocks. He said ordering it that way would make me sound more sophisticated. When I ordered water now, I did it with a smile and hoped to God it made me sound as immature and pathetic as possible.
I gulped the deliciously cold tap water down in two huge swallows as soon as the bartender handed it to me. Before he could get the chance to walk away I made a circle motion with my pointer finger and yelled, “Keep ‘em coming!” 
That earned me an amused but slightly predatory grin from the college-aged bartender with floppy black hair and neck tattoos. I had a thing for tattoos, it was like a weakness of mine, but I was so off the clock tonight.
So I turned my head away from Mr. I Dig Minors bartender and out to the riotous crowd. This was it; this was why I loved Wednesdays. There was too much adrenaline pumping in the shared air for people to really notice me. I mean, if I was talking one-on-one to someone they got the vibes, but usually people were so absorbed in the music I was hardly noticed at all. And the smells of cheap liquor and vomit helped put them off the scent. 
Not to mention I had a deep and abiding love affair with music.
All music. 
It didn’t really matter what kind or how good. If it, whatever it was, was put to music I could easily lose myself completely. Seriously from bad pop to heavy rock to my favorite classical composers, I loved it all. 
Well, maybe except the jazz flute. Regular flute was fine. But jazz… that was an entirely different circle of hell as far as I was concerned.
An ugly, confusing, shrill sounding circle of Hell.
Just don’t tell Ron Burgundy I felt that way.
It was during this perusal of my environment that my eyes fell into, not to, but into the gray depths of Ryder Sutton. I felt my mouth fall open; literally my bottom lip detached from the firm hold my top lip had on it and my jaw followed. 
He glared at me from across the room. Glared at me. He had his back to the far wall and one foot propped up with his knee bent. His arms were folded across his chest and even from here I could see ripped biceps tensed and flexed. He was in the same outfit he wore earlier today, the only difference was his hair was slightly bigger. It wasn’t like his hair had multiplied or anything, but it just stood out from his head a bit less controlled…. crazier…. no…. sexier. Like he had his hands in it, or someone else had their hands in it. 
Like Kenna Lee, who had just walked by me without even noticing I was here and straight to her cliché-rebel-boyfriend. Ryder then proceeded to take his eyes off me, put them on his girlfriend and then rock her world by pulling her into the most disgusting display of public affection I had ever seen.
Gross.
I so did not get people kissing in front of other people.
	Hell, I didn’t even get how people liked other people enough to like kissing them. 
	Romance was weird.
	In my life, romance didn’t even exist.
	The bartender handed me my second glass of water and when I was finished with that one, I slammed it down on the bar like I had just finished the proudest kind of awful-tasting-shot. This earned a throw your head back kind of laugh from Neck Tattoos, to which I had to agree, I was hilarious. 
	It was amazing how escaping my life for even just three hours took the weight off my shoulders and allowed me to have some fun. If I could let this loose after three hours, imagine ultimate freedom in two years. 
	I winced in anticipation. I could make it. I could get through two years.
	“Ivy?” someone yelled from behind me. 
	I gave the bartender a desperate look for more water to which he shook his head, amused at me, and then turned around praying it wasn’t Ryder and Kenna. 
	Some prayers are answered with a “yes.” 
	Some prayers are answered with a “no.” 
	This was a “no” kind of situation. 
	“Hey!” I shouted over the music. “What are you doing here?” I forced myself to keep my eyes on Kenna and not look around for Ryder who seemed to have disappeared. He hated me that much he couldn’t even stand to have awkward small talk with me? 
	I seriously had to get to the bottom of this.
	“My boyfriend is playing tonight,” Kenna shouted back. She was dressed for the girlfriend-of-the-band part in a fifties’ style red wrap around dress with black polka-dots. Her long, black hair floated around her shoulders in silky straightness that remained perfectly unfrizzed and untouched by the humid atmosphere of the bar. She was wearing a proud smile and bouncing in her vintage ivory pumps showing off her extreme excitement. 
	“Ryder?” I clarified. 
	Instead of trying to beat the volume contest she nodded, flashing a smile full of affectionate pride. 
	“Cool!” I offered back and then turned my own attention to the stage. I wasn’t sure if she wanted to hang out or not and it was way too loud to try to carry on a conversation. Plus, I didn’t really have anything to say…. so there was that. 
	 We bobbed and swayed in the general vicinity of each other for twenty more minutes, rocking out to some grass-roots kind of blues sung by college aged boys with underdeveloped voices and wardrobes straight from the Kurt Cobain catalogue. 
Perfection.
Kenna didn’t exactly engage with me, but she didn’t walk away either. I didn’t know what to do, or say, so I stayed near the bar and slammed another shooter of water. I didn’t have to look back at Kenna to know her eyes were on me and my tumbler full of ice and clear liquid. She would assume the worst.
I would let her. 
The opening band finished up their set and the loud music was replaced by a quieter but none the less angsty speaker sound. I finally turned back to Kenna to force myself into small talk. I was out of excuses and some irrational part of me wanted to prove to her that I was still lucid despite the three supposed shots of vodka she assumed I had taken. I sucked in a breath, prepped myself with a faux mental face slap full of cocky self-assurance and opened my mouth to make a comment about the last band but the menial opinion died in my throat because Ryder was standing next to her now. 
	With his gray eyes watching me intently, I lost the nerve to say anything and instead my attention fell to the toned arm he had wrapped around Kenna’s waist. I grunted when I noticed the green and black tattoo marks snaking up his forearm. Didn’t I just say I liked tattoos? But his… he was so cliché. I swear he had read some kind of bad-boy handbook and followed steps one through twelve to pull his dangerous rep together. 
	Plus a band? Seriously. 
	“You here for an AA meeting?” Ryder asked from the other side of Kenna.
	“Obviously, those are anonymous,” I retorted, with attitude. Let the record show, I answered with attitude. 
	“Right,” he smirked. And for a moment, for like a moment and a half, I thought he was flirting with me, but then his hand squeezed Kenna’s side and she giggled happily before swatting his chest. 
	“Dedicate a song to me?” she asked in a cute pout I would never stoop to.
	“Of course,” Ryder smiled down at her. This was his get-lucky-later-play. And Kenna was eating it all up. I, of course, rolled my eyes. I had to. The situation demanded an eye roll. “I’ll dedicate one to you too, Red.”
	“I’m a recovering sexaholic, be careful with your promises,” I shot back snidely. 
	“No worries,” his smile turned genuine and he looked down at his girlfriend again. “I’m faithful to the girl I love.”
	Holy hell. It was a warning. He was warning me! He thought I was into him! 
	I rolled my eyes. Again. And he disappeared to go start his sound check after another agonizingly long public display of affection with Kenna. 
	She had to fan herself when he finally walked away.
	But true to his word, she did get a song dedication by him and his band Sugar Skulls. So did I, it was a song called “Crash and Burn,” and he dedicated it to me and Folgers Dark Roast.

Chapter Six

	Ryder and his band were good. Like, really, really good. 
	Their sound was something in between a soft indie-alternative like Snow Patrol and something a little bit harsher and more rock and roll like the Black Keys. The blend was solid with all the basics of a garage band: bass guitar, second guitar, drum and at times a harmonica. Ryder held it all together at the mic- with vocals and lead guitar. 
Was anybody surprised that Ryder played lead guitar?
Anybody?
Nope, not me either. 
But he looked good doing it. I couldn’t fault him there. His vocals were perfection, deep, rich and sexy. He caressed the sound as it carried across the room. He connected the enraptured audience as if he was singing a personal ballad for each individual fan. I believed his love songs, I felt emotion in his lyrics. Hell, I even danced. 
And then there was the guitar.
I really, really hated how good he was at the guitar. 
No boy should be that good at something. Especially not a high school boy. 
“He’s amazing, isn’t he?” Kenna shouted in my ear, probably noticing the drool running from the corner of my mouth to my chin.
Uh, amazing didn’t begin to cover it.
“He’s alright,” I admitted with a shrug of one shoulder.
Kenna gave me an incredulous look that doubted the nonchalance of my answer, but didn’t press me to say anything more. Having no more conversation between us, she returned her attention to the stage. She watched Ryder with a rapt attention that left me with little doubt the girl was in love with him. 
My chest tightened at the thought and I rubbed against my heart. Suddenly I was really hot and cranky and I had no idea why my lungs felt like they stopped working. I unzipped my hoodie and slipped out of it, setting it on one of the tall stools lined up in front of the bar. I signaled to the bartender I was ready for more water and he chuckled at me from where he stood. I couldn’t actually hear him chuckle, but I watched his shoulders bounce up and down in a chuckling motion. 
	“I’ve never heard them play here before,” I announced to Kenna in between songs, while Ryder was exchanging his electric guitar for the acoustic variety. 
	“Um, they’ve had a pretty steady gig here for a while now,” Kenna explained and then her eyes got big with realization. “Oh, probably while you were away. Ryder moved here right before…. uh…. right before Sam. So, maybe you guys just didn’t cross paths before?” 
	I whipped my head back to the stage not able to come up with any kind of response. I tried to focus on Ryder’s fingers gliding across the strings of his instrument and the way he started the song softly and alone. This was the song he was dedicating to Kenna. This was an intimate love song that made innocent girls blush and not so innocent girls horny. But it was all lost to me while Sam’s name bounced back and forth in my brain inciting the kind of drowning panic I was becoming too familiar with.
I didn’t want to talk to Kenna about Sam. I didn’t want to talk to Kenna about anything anymore.  My hands started trembling, freezing up into stiff joints and unusable fingers, so I shoved them deep into the pockets of my jeans. But no matter how hard I fought against the spreading ache in my chest or tried to ignore the quickly spiraling thoughts leading me into very dangerous territory, he was still there, still heavy in my head. Sam. Ugh, Sam. Heat prickled against the back of my eyes and I felt my nose start running in a sure sign tears were on their way. 
	Damn it.
	“I’m going to the bathroom,” I shouted sharply against the soft smoothness of Ryder’s acoustic solo and then left Kenna alone. 
	I left too fast to know if she replied; I just hoped she didn’t try to follow me. I was so not in the mood for sympathy or worse… pity. I pushed into the equally dim bathroom and immediately turned on the faucet. I ran my hands under the hot water and scrubbed at the invisible germs I felt caking my skin, clinging to me like grease and filth. I tried to scrape away the guilt and self-loathing. 
	I took a stuttering breath and allowed one tear to slip from my right eye. The lonely drop made a trail down my cheek, ending at my jawline and falling to my t-shirt where it left a small wet spot. A screech of frustration followed, echoing in the long tiled bathroom. I slammed my hands against the wet counter, splashing water on my jeans and bare arms. 
One more tear was allowed freedom, landing on my shirt where it was lost in the other water spots left from the counter splash and then I decided to get ahold of myself. I slowed down my scrubbing and inhaled deeply. I counted to five and then I forced my eyes to the mirror. 
	It was easy to avoid mirrors usually. Most of the time I wished I never had to look at my face ever again. I didn’t care what I looked like. I didn’t want to care what I looked like. And I really didn’t want to see the accusing, hate-filled eyes that I knew would be staring back at me. 
But I still made myself do it. 
I had to get through this with my mind intact. My soul was shot to all hell, and my emotions were one tear-fest away from a doctor-recommended Xanax prescription. But I had my mind. My mind was my savior, my ticket out of here, my future. I had to stay sharp.
That meant facing my demons.
At least some of them. 
I turned the water off and gripped the sides of the sink basin. I slid my eyes upwards and readied my nerves to face myself. 
Rich auburn hair streaked with brighter reddish gold highlights pulled up high on my head. Deep, disturbingly green, emerald eyes. Plump, perfectly bowed red lips. Flawless skin. And that small smattering of freckles across the bridge of my nose.
Mine was the kind of face that guys didn’t forget and girls hated on principal. I was a genetic mistake. A freak of nature and fate and a curse. 
My face was a curse. 
I stared myself down and dared my heart to give up now. 
Sam. Sam didn’t die. Sam is alive. I am alive. Sam will get better one day. Sam has to get better one day. And I will be better one day. One day, I will leave this all behind. 
One day I will be free.
It was a practiced mantra, one that I said constantly to myself. And it worked. I molded my mouth into a smile, tightened my hair-knot and rubbed at my bottom lip since I hadn’t brought ChapStick with me. 
I shook my hands of leftover water and then reached for a paper towel. This was my night of absolute reprieve from my life. I could put up with Kenna and Ryder for a little while longer if it meant I didn’t have to be home alone, or worse with Nix and my mom. 
I turned for the door and decided that I was done wallowing and needed to get over myself when it was suddenly thrust open and Ryder came strutting inside. My hand flew to my neck instinctively and I took a few beats to steady my breathing. My pulse thumped wildly against my fingers and I tightened my grip against my throat. Ryder and I assessed each other from a few feet apart, his eyes were cool and calculating, mine were wide and frightened. 
“You scared the hell out of me!” I finally yelled at him. 
A small smile tugged at the corner of his lips, and his eyes softened into careful amusement. “Sorry,” he finally relented. “Kenna was worried about you. She asked me to check on you.” 
“And that meant storming the girls’ bathroom?” I snapped. 
“I was waiting outside, but you were taking so long I started to wonder if Kenna had a right to be concerned,” he explained. His gray eyes were heated in the low lights of the bathroom but full of excited adrenaline from being on stage. The ends of his hair were damp from being under the hot lights and curled around his neck and over his ears, slick with sweat. His shirt clung to his body, sticking to him from the performance. He was full of feral energy; his presence was completely intrusive and demanding. His energy was infecting the room, reaching every molecule and atom around me, making the air bounce off the walls in an excited frenzy. 
He was overwhelming.
And for once in my life I was the one pulled in. 
“Kenna’s sweet, but as you can see, I’m fine,” I broke the silence that had settled between us. It was in no way comfortable. Being alone with Ryder felt dangerous and explosive. 
“Yes, I can see that,” Ryder nodded, pulling in his bottom lip with his teeth.
After establishing that I was fine, I expected him to escape. I could tell he wasn’t comfortable being around me, which only made me want to explore this phenomenon all the more. He was dominating in the doorway, he took up so much space. But it wasn’t just physical, it was like his presence hovered in every empty space in the small bathroom, pressing against me, crowding me. Pushing me out of the way.
I sucked in a breath, needing to break the silence, “You guys were….” I paused, not sure what to say. Any compliment I could give him didn’t feel like enough, there wasn’t a word for how great he was. But at the same time, saying something nice felt like a betrayal of everything that I was. He didn’t even like me! I couldn’t give him that. 
I was saved by a pack of girls stumbling into the bathroom and directly into his back. They burst into giggles when they realized he was a boy and then glanced between us with knowing looks.
“Sorry,” one of the girls announced on a laugh. She was petite and tiny, with a short blonde bob highlighted with pink and purple streaks. “We didn’t mean to interrupt.”
“It’s no problem,” Ryder announced benevolently, but his eyes had yet to leave mine, making me feel like they actually were interrupting something.
I just didn’t know what. 	
“Oh, my gosh!” another girl announced. She had red hair not at all like mine, vibrant, blindingly red and obviously from a bottle. “You’re Ryder Sutton! You’re from Sugar Skulls!” 
And then the three girls squealed in unison. 
“Oh, my gosh, you’re Ryder Sutton!” I intoned obnoxiously, taking a step forward and laying a hand on his chest bravely. I was annoyed with the girls, both for their intrusion and the way they were ready to drop their panties for him. “I didn’t know it was you!” And I went to move by him. I pushed through the crowd of groupies but left my hand on his chest. His skin was hot and muscled underneath my hand, holding me to him like an intense magnet, locking my skin to his. 
He turned with me, apparently not minding that we were causing a scene. His hand wrapped around my wrist, his strong fingers closing tight against my bare skin. A lone butterfly flapped distantly in my belly, and a charge of electricity shot straight up my sternum into my heart. What the hell? 
“You know me,” he stated simply. His silver eyes bore into mine and his tight hold on my wrist kept my hand to his chest, when I thought for sure he was going to remove my touch. 
“I don’t know anything about you,” I replied, just as simply, just as sincerely. 
The redhead let out a burst of rude laughter breaking into the bubble of intimacy Ryder had created around us. I snapped my head her direction, reminded that we were still in the bathroom, that Ryder still wasn’t affected by my charm judging by the cold look in his gunmetal eyes and that his girlfriend was waiting outside for us. 
“Fair enough,” Ryder admitted and then released my hand. My arm dropped to my side and I worked my hand into a fist and then relaxed it trying to find the strength that had been there a minute ago. But my hand was useless, completely zapped of motor function and usability thanks to the weird spell Ryder put on me. 
I was never affected by men. Never. That was the key to my voodoo.  
I did the affecting. 
Not the other way around. 
Ryder needed to learn that. 
Or I needed to get the hell away from him.
Probably both. 
I pulled the bathroom door open a little too violently and it swung at me with a rush of hot, humid air from the concert hall. I jumped out of the way and tumbled out of the bathroom. The gaggle of fan-girls erupted into laughter and I felt Ryder immediately behind me, escaping before they asked for autographs on their boobs. 
Kenna was waiting at the bar for us, holding my sweatshirt in her hands, probably to save it from the exiting masses. The concert was officially over and save for some last minute t-shirt sales the crowd en masse was pushing their way through the door and out onto 14th street. 
“Thanks,” I offered to Kenna, reaching for my hoodie. “He’s all yours.” I threw out as a candid acknowledgment of Ryder behind me. 
There was a long moment of awkward silence before Kenna looked me straight in the eyes with a pinched expression and declared, “He’s always been all mine.” 
Yikes.
I didn’t know how to respond to that. I hadn’t meant to issue a challenge, but Kenna was looking at me like she was deciding which hand to slap me with. 
“She is well aware, Ken,” Ryder saved me by pulling his girlfriend to him and nuzzling into her neck. 
Ugh. More PDA.
I looked longingly at the door, determined to flee. My night of freedom had been trampled and tainted by these two love birds and now I was being accused of poaching. Kenna’s claws had come out to protect her valuables and I was caught in between the product of my heritage and the uncomfortable third wheel.
“Seriously, Kenna,” I started, forcing an apology from my lips. This was not in my nature, but something deeper than my instinct to run whispered that I needed to protect this relationship. Or at least protect Ryder…. from myself. “I don’t know what you’ve heard, but I’m not like that. I mean, what’s yours is yours. I didn’t mean to intrude tonight. You came up to me…. I’m not interested in… I mean, you have nothing to worry about.”
Ryder looked up at me from his hold on Kenna and could barely hold back his laughter. “You’ve given her a hard enough time, Kenna. She gets it, yeah?” 
“Yeah, she gets it,” Kenna answered Ryder and her eyes narrowed on me further. 
“I get it,” I repeated and then backed up toward the bar. I needed another drink before the bus ride home. I turned my back on the happy couple and called out to the bartender. “One more for the road,” I flirted a little, flashing him a smile, since he was already cleaning up and I knew I was being a pain in the ass. 
“I’m just not sure the vodka gets it,” Kenna sniped, not even trying to soften her voice or disguise her disgust. 
“Hey, give me a break,” Neck Tattoos held up his hand in a gesture of surrender. “It’s just water. I don’t serve minors.” And then he went back to scrubbing down the bar. That was the last shot of H2O I was getting tonight. 
Thankfully the bartender had been defensive enough that even I believed he wouldn’t have served me. I turned back to Ryder and Kenna not really wanting to meet either of them in the eye. Water was bad for my rep. 
I ignored the part of my soul that felt relieved somebody else had seen this part of me. The part that preferred water. The innocent thirsty part of me.
I didn’t know what that meant and now was not the time to try and untangle the mountains of screwed up I was. 
“Uh, recovering addict and all,” I mumbled. I didn’t exactly meet their curious stares, but I did notice Ryder’s lips curve into a barely there smile. “Well, good talk. See you two tomorrow.” 
I maneuvered around them during their simultaneous goodbyes and finally fled into the cool night. I immediately threw my hoodie on, zipped it up to the top and pulled on my hood. I had a trek to get back home and chances were homework was completely out of the picture. But I had gotten my night of freedom. 
And there were parts of it that actually felt…. free.

Chapter Seven

	“Hey,” Chase met me on the sidewalk in front of the school the minute I stepped out of Exie’s silver Lexus. I gave a fast wave to Exie and met him in front of the long set of stone steps leading to the front door of the antiquated school. Once upon a time Omaha was the capital city of Nebraska and Central High School the capitol building. When Nebraska moved the yellow star to Lincoln, Central became a high school. It was a really pretty building, but a super crappy school… at least in my opinion. 
Chase was football-star-studly today in his letterman jacket and swoopy hair that fell across his forehead. He two-strapped his backpack and rocked back and forth on his heels while waiting for me. I was the recipient of a very confident smile this morning. His two dimples were like some kind of magical force, drawing out my own smile I thought had died sometime in the night.
	“Hey yourself,” I replied without any edge in my voice. Yay for me. “Were you waiting for me?”
	“Yep,” he grinned down at me. “Walk you to class?” 
	I wasn’t sure what to do with his chivalry so I just nodded. I was used to boys and boyfriends and all that came with them. It was like my after school job. But in reality I hadn’t had a boyfriend since last year, since…. Sam. And I felt awkward trying to get back into the pattern. There were instincts buried inside of me that would let me flirt freely and command attention with practiced skill. But right now I felt alien in this role, I couldn’t remember how to toss out smiles and demand flattery. Right now I just wanted to go back home and go to bed. 
	We took the long walk up the stairs in silence. I could feel Chase radiating with an excited energy that should be contagious, that should reinforce my self-esteem and pride. Instead, I sludged along next to him, holding back an epic sigh that would signify my utter dread for the day ahead. 
	Ugh. I was so messed up.
	“So Calculus again?” I asked at the top of the staircase. We were as reluctant as most of our peers to actually enter the building, so we hung out collectively with the rest of the student body in front of the two story-stone façade.  
	“Nope,” Chase cut me a side glance as if he was surprised I had paid attention yesterday. “Applied Physics.” 
	“Even more fun,” I smiled at him, happy to have his full attention. There was something about being near Chase, having his eyes on me, standing in his shadow. He was like the sun, bright and happy and warm. He was exactly what I needed right now. Even if I didn’t feel a spark from my end, I could still breathe when I was near him.
	And I needed to breathe. 
	Besides, when were there ever sparks from my end? 
	He opened his mouth to say something, but we were interrupted by a gangly arm that reached out to clasp hands with Chase. Phoenix emerged from the crowd around us all smiles and long limbs. He was wearing at least three different shirts all layered in chaos, a short sleeve, a long sleeve and then another short sleeve. His loose, low-waisted jeans were ripped at the knees and tattered at the cuffs and his hair was curlier than yesterday but I suspected that had something to do with the October drizzle this morning. He was also wearing big, pink-framed, plastic sun-glasses that I was sure were purchased in the junior’s section of Target. 
	“What’s up, Phoenix?” Chase asked him, breaking out into a friendly smile. 
	I was surprised I had never run into any of these guys before this year. Although Central was a very big school, several hundred to each graduating class. Still, they were good looking enough and seemingly popular enough that they at least should have been on my radar last year. Then again, when I actually read the badges stitched to Chase’s letterman jacket I remembered soccer was his sport of choice and last year had been all about making my way through the basketball team. 
	“Not much,” Phoenix returned and then his attention fell to me. “Ivy,” he acknowledged happily.
	“Phoenix,” I replied back in a mock imitation of his deeper voice.
	“Kenna tells me you were at the show last night. You should have stuck around, you could have chilled with the band,” Phoenix’s smile widened with pride and I realized he must have been part of the band.
	“You’re in the band?” I asked bluntly, a little disturbed that I hadn’t noticed. It wasn’t like I was into Phoenix for more than friendship, if that could even exist for me, but I still should have noticed him. Then again I couldn’t place faces to any of the band members. 
	Save for one, the stupid lead guitar. 
	Freaking Ryder. 
	He was seriously throwing me off my game. 
	“What? Yes! I’m the drummer!” Phoenix defended himself as if I really hurt his ego. 
	Oops. 
	“Sorry,” I gushed with a little bit of laughter. “I guess I couldn’t see you beyond the egomaniac in front.” 
	Phoenix nodded in agreement and gave me a look that said he forgave me. “So you’ll stick around next time? Hang out after?”
	“Sure,” I conceded, hoping to avoid any future Sugar Skulls concerts and if at all possible run-ins with Kenna or Ryder in general. 
	“You went to see Sugar Skulls last night?” Chase asked. His eyebrows had drawn together and he seemed a bit confused and a bit more hurt. “I would have gone if I would have known you were going to be there.” His lips curved into his signature charming smile and the hurt was washed away and replaced with easy flirtation. 
	“It was a, uh, last minute decision,” I lied. “Plus I didn’t know I was going to see Sugar Skulls. I didn’t even know who they were until last night. I was just getting out of the house and I like the Slowdown on Wednesday nights.” That was more like the truth, but not common information either and I felt a chill of fear run through me. I wasn’t used to sharing this much, revealing this much about me. 
	“Right?” Phoenix agreed via question. “Slowdown gave us a pretty steady gig for Wednesdays, so there will be plenty of chances to hang. You can be like our groupie!”
	“Ugh,” I groaned. “I met some of your groupies last night. I didn’t realize you thought so little of me.” 
	“We have groupies?” Phoenix asked, genuinely surprised. 
	“Well, I don’t know if they could be applied to the whole band, but um, Ryder has groupies.” 
	This got both Chase and Phoenix to laugh. “Of course he does,” Chase grinned. “Speak of the devil.” 
	Kenna and Ryder appeared from the thick mob of students climbing the steps to the school building. Ryder had his arm draped across Kenna’s shoulders and they were smiling and laughing and drooling and making googly eyes at each other and in love. And I wanted to vomit. Chase slipped his hand to my lower back in a move of possession and I sunk against his body, thankful for a place to go. I pressed against his side; half hoping he would just absorb me inside him. Gross, right? Still the desperation to disappear weighed consuming and suffocating against my lungs.  
	Chase wasn’t home, but he could at the very least be a shelter from the storm of my life. 
	“Morning love birds,” Phoenix called out to them. 
	Suddenly I was surrounded by people….. by friends? It was very confusing. I didn’t do friends. And what was more confusing was me.
	“Hey, Kenna,” I called out as a way of greeting. 
	She had the good grace to only hesitate for a second before responding, “Hey, Ivy.” 
She eyed me over like I was ready to attack her precious boyfriend at any second and I shuffled backward out of the tight circle we had created. My eyes flickered to Ryder instinctually, but not in the man-eating way Kenna assumed I meant, more in like the…. I didn’t know what kind of way! The kind that felt like a gravitational pull, the kind of way that made it feel as though I was helpless to stop the slide of my eyes. The confusing kind of way. He was watching me with careful amusement, like I was his entertainment, like it was possible for him to look anywhere else, but he chose to look at me. I had to get out of there. Chase’s arm dropped from my back and he turned to face me, confused by my retreat. I struggled for an excuse but then my phone rang, some miraculous intervention by the gods, and I reached for it quickly.
I held it up in apology, waving it around and letting the loud ringtone pierce the conversation that surrounded us. I walked into the school building away from all those impossible but bourgeoning friendships. 
“Hello?” I asked into the speaker without checking the caller ID first. 
“Nix is here? Why didn’t you tell me?” Exie screeched from the other line. 
I waited a beat, hoping she would forgive me in the silence of the airways. No such luck. “Who told you?” I sighed into the phone. This is why I didn’t do friendship…. I wasn’t any good at it. But I did like to protect my girls. They were the closest thing I would ever have to real relationships. 
“Sloane made the announcement this morning. Her mom is throwing some kind of shindig for him tomorrow night. You should have given us the heads up.” She sounded hurt. “You should have told me this morning in the car.” 
No. She sounded terrified. 
And she was right. 
I should have given her the heads up.
I should have texted them both last night.
“I’m sorry,” I breathed into the phone, finding my locker and stuffing my backpack into it. “I was hoping you wouldn’t have to deal with him. I was hoping he was just here for me and mom.” 
“Apparently he rented an apartment. I guess he’s going to be here for a while,” she grumbled and I could feel her freaking out through the airwaves separating us. 
“How’s Sloane doing?” I asked, taking some of the pressure off Exie. 
“She’s freaked. Evaleen turns twenty-one in two months.” 
Shoot. I hadn’t thought about anyone other than myself. “Your sister’s already twenty-one,” I reminded her on a whisper. Not that she needed to be reminded. I felt despair settle over me and pushed my forehead against my open locker door, pressing my skin to the cold metal.  Ridges in the metal, vents that kept the locker from smelling like dirty socks, pressed into my cheek, indenting my skin with the harsh edges.
“Anaxandra wants this life,” Exie replied and I could tell she was near tears. Her sister was no different from anyone else in our circle.  
“Anaxandra’s been brainwashed by Prada and European vacations,” I bit out harsher than I intended. 
Instead of getting defensive Exie let out a tired sigh, “So has Evaleen.” There was a long moment of silence while we digested the exact meaning of those words before Exie asked in a shaken, weak voice, “Will that be us one day?” 
“No,” I answered immediately, my voice steady and full of conviction. I took a breath and fortified my resolve, “Never.” 
More silence on her end. She wasn’t so sure. Damn it, we were stronger than designer purses and expensive cars. Stronger than our sisters. Stronger than our mothers. 
So much stronger. 
“Talk more later?” Exie asked. 
“Give Sloane my love,” and then I hung up. 
I stared into my locker full of books and notebooks and loose papers unseeing for a long time, long after the warning bell rang. Students and teachers rushed by me, the overwhelming noise and bustle of the morning faded away. And only I remained. The hall was empty behind me, everyone else carefully tucked away in homeroom. 
Eventually, I pulled myself back to reality and picked out my American Civilization book and the corresponding notebook.
Crap. I was late. Again…. Mrs. Tanner was going to have my ass for this. 
I slammed my locker shut with as much force as I could muster and then kicked it for good measure. A string of curse words flew from my mouth before I could stop them and my hair came loose from the effort I took to attack my locker. I threw my books down in another attempt at getting rid of the stifling anger boiling inside of me, none of it having to do with tardiness. My pen skittered across the tiled floor and bounced into the opposite bank of lockers. 
It was too much. All of it. 
Breathing was suddenly difficult, the world fading out around me. My vision narrowed to pinpricks and a high pitched ringing pierced my ears. I was so frustrated. So, tirelessly frustrated. I hated it all…. Nix, my mom, this stupid world I lived in, that my hair had gotten messed up, that I had to care about my hair at all. And now a party? I couldn’t do this. 
Some days, after everything I had been through in my life, some days eighteen didn’t feel that far away.
But then there were days like today when eighteen might as well have been eighty and the end was nowhere in sight.      
“You alright, Red?” a voice asked from just a few feet away.
I hammered my head back against the lockers before I opened my eyes to meet the voice. 
Ryder.

Chapter Eight

“Just fine,” I answered Ryder, not trying to hide the despair choking the life out of me. He wouldn’t care anyway. Actually, he’d probably ignore it completely. 
Thank God. 
“Sure about that?” He asked with a sarcastic edge to his voice that grated across the space between us.
Today Ryder was wearing a long sleeved gray thermal shirt and dark washed jeans over leather flip flops. His hair was layered carelessly at least a good inch off his forehead, pushed out of the way by an obsessive need to run his hand through it. His gray eyes were gunmetal with concern and he was holding a stack of papers divided up with yellow sticky notes labeling them.
“Yes, I’m sure.” I snapped. 
“That’s why you’re at war with your locker instead of in class?” he assessed me judgmentally from where he leaned against the opposite wall. I wanted to think he was joking, but there was nothing light or teasing in his eyes. He was radiating worry and it was driving me crazy with the need to prove I didn’t need him to care about me. 
I gave him half a smile anyway for his attempt at humor and then turned away from him so that I could stare down the long hallway. Light from the arched windows skittered across the floor, breaking up the dull florescent lighting that buzzed with the effort to stay on. 
“It’s just that… this locker really pisses me off,” I finally admitted. 
Ryder choked on surprised laughter and I turned back to face him. His expression had relaxed into amusement and I could finally suck in a much needed breath. “You two should probably get couples’ counseling then, since you have to put up with each other for the rest of the year and all.” He bent over to retrieve my pen before he crossed the hallway in three strides so that we were just inches away from each other. He remained calm and cool, my presence doing none of its usual tricks. So I was even more irritated by how unfair it was that I was struggling to remain indifferent. He was just fine, completely freaking fine. He was like this presence that penetrated every last bit of my consciousness, even his shadow weighed heavily on me, pressing me back into the bank of metal lockers. And his smell, maybe his cologne that clung to his clothes and floated in the air between us was surprisingly delicious and maybe a bit peculiar… like coconut and cookies. It infiltrated every one of my senses until I could barely suppress the need to lean into him and nuzzle against his neck. His smell threw me off. Way off.
“You smell like a girl,” I blurted out a little bit too loud. 
Ryder paused, giving me a look of complete confusion, before his lips slowly turned up into an amused grin. “Shut it, Pierce. It’s my shampoo.” 
An unexpected giggle burst from my throat and I smacked my hand over my mouth to stop any more foreign sounds from escaping. “Your shampoo?” 
“It’s coconut oil,” he admitted, dipping his head as if embarrassed.
“Why?” I asked simply, shaking my head at him.
“Don’t ask questions you’re not prepared to hear the answers to,” Ryder growled ominously, but I could tell he was being sarcastic. 
“What does that even mean?” I shook my head at him, laughter bubbling up inside me again. 
 “I don’t really know,” he laughed too, mimicking the side to side motion of my head. “But I was trying to sound manly again. You know, most girls like it. I usually get complimented.” He finally defended himself with an air of self-importance, crossing his arms across his chest and pulling his t-shirt tight across his pronounced muscles. 
	My eyes dropped from his silver pools of eyes to his chest for just two and a half seconds before I popped my gaze up hoping he hadn’t noticed. The narrowed slits of his eyes told me there was no chance in hell I got away with checking him out. Shoot. 
“I’m not most girls,” I grumbled. I bent over to pick up my books that were strewn in a messy pile at my feet and Ryder held out my pen to me, waiting for me to stand up again. 
	I heard him mumble, “That is the truth,” under his breath and I whipped up into standing to launch a full-fledged attack on him when I found him grinning at me, completely disarming my intentions. “It’s supposed to be healthy…. like good for me. I was told that it would reduce my uh…. issues with my hair. I’m starting to think the girl who cuts it might actually hate me though.” 
	It took me until the word “hair” to realize we were talking about his shampoo again and not my issues. When I finally caught up to the conversation I couldn’t stop myself from laughing again. Real laughter, the kind that expanded in my lungs and bubbled out of my mouth like a fountain. The expansion in my chest felt foreign and underused and my lungs ached with the effort, but in a good way…. a really good way. 
	“Your hair is kind of awful, actually,” I admitted lightly. My fingers were tangled through his coarse locks before I knew what I was doing. My hand slid through his thick, unruly hair, brushing it back from his forehead and testing the rough, bristly texture between my fingertips. 
	“What?” He gasped with faux defensiveness, his eyes going wide with pretend horror. “You’re not turned on by the sexy bedhead look?” He leaned forward and shook his head roughly so that my fingers fell from his hair, displaced and instantly missing the touch. 
	I only had a second to take in my feelings though when he lifted his head and was just inches from me, closer than we were before…. closer than we had ever been. “I had no idea you were so vain,” I whispered, trying to find the good natured humor that was with us seconds ago.
“I’m not vain,” he narrowed his eyes, but didn’t put any more distance between us. “I’m just…. afraid I will hurt someone if I don’t take proper care of it.”
“Good point,” I agreed, taking a big breath and speaking with more volume so our close proximity didn’t feel so intimate. “Why is it so scratchy?” I laughed at him. “It’s like horse hair!”
	“It is not!” he defended himself animatedly and then punched me very gently in the shoulder, pushing my back against the locker, but not in an unkind way. He was gentle but firm… detached but oh so sexy.
	Holy hell.
	My breathing was suddenly very shallow…. shaky, pathetically hitched. I ran my tongue along my bottom lip, so aware of every piece of his body and how close we were standing. His hair was lifted from where I ran my fingers through it, casting a shadow over his too pensive eyes. His gaze was smoky and penetrating and I was frozen beneath him in confusion and lust.  
	“It is,” I argued, but my voice was a shell of its former lightheartedness. “But I understand the coconut now.” I smiled, secretly praying he wouldn’t kiss me…. secretly pleading that he would. And then to force myself into distance, “Probably safer for Kenna that way. Plus, you kind of smell like cookies.” 
	“At least now you understand,” Ryder smirked, arrogant and cocky, and the spell was broken. He stood up to his full height, towering over me and resonating dispassion. “I suppose you want a pass for class now?”
	I gasped as hope and the thrilling feeling of ease swelled in my chest. “You can write me a pass?” There was almost a desperate quality to my voice, I was kind of pitiful. But I had to get my act together here and now, I had to make it through this school year and the next. I couldn’t afford to mess up. 
	“Office aide, remember? Yesterday you spilled coffee all over me, yelled at me and then out of the very goodness of my heart I wrote you a pass? Any of this ringing a bell?” He was teasing me now, in the same way that made me feel like he planned on keeping a very wide measure of space between us. 
	Maybe that’s why my heart had relaxed. Ryder was complicated. Too complicated. It was like our powers were reversed. And I didn’t like that at all.
	“Oh yes, now I remember!” I grinned at him, snapping my fingers as if in time with the memory. “You will save my life if you can write me a pass today though. I promise if I ask Mrs. Tanner to write one, she’ll expel me instead.” 
	“Expel you, huh?” Ryder asked from over his shoulder as we made our way down the hallway and to the office. 
	“Okay, probably not expel me. But definitely try to burn me at the stake,” I mumbled, trying to keep my tone light. Ryder shot me a confused look. “You know, like a witch trial?” 
	“Ah, but she could probably make a valid case.” Ryder turned his head again, shooting me a very amused grin, but something didn’t quite reach his eyes… like he almost believed I could be a witch.
	I shook my head. It wasn’t possible. Even if thinking I was a witch was completely off base and totally in the realm of crazy, there was no way Ryder could tell I was different. It just wasn’t possible. 
	I waited outside the office while Ryder ran in to drop off the stack of folders he was holding and retrieve the small yellow notepad that would excuse me from missing nearly all of my first hour class. I watched him, discreetly, or what I hoped was discreetly, while he leaned over the tall counter and wrote some lame and untrue excuse down. This view of him was perfection with his back to me and his head bent furtively scrawling in sharpie across the notepad. His shoulders were broad and muscled, his hair just a little long at his collar and the heels of his feet hidden beneath long, tattered hems. A sigh escaped me before I could stop it and I slammed my back into the cold stone wall that lined the halls in between banks of lockers, completely wrecking my view of Ryder and the office.
	Grrr.
	What was going on with me? 
	I stared off into space, focusing my gaze on the windowed front doors so that I wouldn’t be tempted to check out Ryder or his delicious ass anymore. Ugh…
	Voices and commotion drew my attention to the other end of the hallway when a classroom door banged open and students filed into the corridor. I squinted in an effort to recognize any of them as they walked excitedly in my direction. Chase was somewhere in the middle of the crowd, with Phoenix right at his side and my heart stuttered a little with anxiety. I shook away the feeling of being caught, and tried to convince myself that not only was there nothing going on between Ryder and me, but Chase didn’t really have any claim over me anyway. 
	If I were my mother or any of the other women in our circle, I would be practically bursting with pride and a reason to make both men jealous. But I was so not them and sickening guilt and shame flushed through my blood like a fast rush of self-loathing.  
	I put on my best smile and willed my eyes to look happy when Chase and Phoenix slowed down to talk to me. Chase cast a curious, worried glance in the office and I wondered if it was aimed at Ryder or the potential trouble I could be in. 
	“Hey what are you guys up to?” I asked, drawing Chase’s gaze back to me. 
	He held up a paper airplane that was being carefully grasped between his thumb and index finger and waved it around. “Physics project,” he explained. 	
	“We’re taking it to the hill,” Phoenix cut in, and nodded with his head toward the front doors of the school that would lead out to sprawling, steep hills on either side of the long staircase and down to Dodge Street. 
	“Fun,” I drawled unenthusiastically.
	“What are you up to?” Chase asked, taking a step closer to me. 
I hesitated while Ryder walked out of the office handing me the pass. It burned in my fingers, painting me as guilty. Ryder exchanged greetings with his friends completely unfazed with what I was going through. Of course, he wouldn’t or shouldn’t feel any of the stirrings of guilt or remorse; we really had done nothing wrong.   
	“My phone call went long,” I explained not telling a lie, but not exactly telling the truth either…. my specialty. “Ryder was nice enough to write me a pass so I wouldn’t get marked for being late.”
	“Aw, that’s nice of you, buddy,” Phoenix crooned at Ryder and tried to pinch his cheek. 
	“Back off, man,” Ryder laughed, smacking away Phoenix’s long, gangly arm.
	Their exchange was followed by thirty very awkward seconds of silence while Chase sized Ryder up and shot me a nervous glance that let me know to some men, I still had power. Chase took another step toward me, like he was marking his territory and a flash of panic heated my belly. Not wanting to examine it for too long, or analyze if my reaction had anything to do with Ryder’s watching gaze, I raised my hand in a wave goodbye. 
	“Well, thanks for the pass Ryder,” I started walking backward, clutching my books to my chest and the thin yellow paper between my fingers tightly. “I better get to class, since I’ve missed so much already. See you guys at lunch.” 
	I didn’t wait for any response, but turned on my heel and high-tailed it out of there. Okay, weird morning. But at least I had been sufficiently distracted from thoughts of Nix, my mother, or what was waiting for me at home tonight.

Chapter Nine

	“Thanks again for the ride,” I offered for the fourth time. Chase sat across the armrest in the driver’s seat of his tan Honda Civic sedan and smiled at me. It was obvious I was stalling, but I was hoping he thought it was just because I wanted to spend time with him.
	Which I kind of did. Chase was easy to be around, there was no hidden agenda, no evil plans for my future or even my pants. I could breathe. And breathing was the most important thing in my life right now. 
	“We could go do something if you’re not ready to go home yet?” he answered back intuitively. 
	“No, I’m ready,” I whispered weakly and then realized how lame I sounded. “What I mean is that it isn’t that. I just…. um, this is nice.” I motioned back and forth between us with my pointer finger. He grabbed onto it yanked my arm forward playfully. His fingers grazed the inside of my palm slowly, barely touching but capturing all of my attention. 
	“This is nice,” he gave me his charming smile, the one that melted normal girls’ insides and then somehow, through tricky moves only boys can pull off, his hand was now holding mine. “So tomorrow is Friday….” he started suggestively. 
	“Finally,” I breathed out in relief because I was supposed to, because it was expected. Every sixteen year old looked forward to the weekend. It was the way of life. But truthfully, with Nix around I preferred to be in school over the freedom of the weekend, not to mention the cocktail party tomorrow night that was bound to leave bone marrow deep scars and painful emotional trauma on my psyche. 
	“And I thought maybe I could take you out…?” He spoke his words slowly, carefully, like he was nervous and unsure. He was adorable, I couldn’t deny that. 
	“Tomorrow night?” I gulped, wishing more than anything I could say yes. He nodded while his deep blue eyes begged me to say yes, not to let him down. “I can’t,” I groaned and there was nothing but sincerity behind my tone. “I have this family thing and there’s no way I can miss it.” I pushed out a playful pout and moved my thumb back to graze across the inside of his wrist. 
	“Oh, bummer,” he replied, equally as sincere.
	Chase was so sweet, so super sweet. If I had to suffer through all this dating, I was lucky there were guys like Chase out there that made it easier. God knew I had dated some absolute tools in my short lifetime. Chase was an exception to the rule and one that I wouldn’t be able to hold on to for long. And I hated to disappoint him, but our reasons for wanting to go out tomorrow night were completely different. I wanted to escape the crazy, f-ed up world I lived in and he couldn’t help himself but be attracted to me. It wasn’t his fault, but it wasn’t totally sincere either. 
	“But I’m free Saturday night,” I offered with a small smile. My thoughts flickered to Sam and how sweet he had been at first. I couldn’t let that happen with Chase, I couldn’t ruin his life because I was selfish, because I was fundamentally and forever screwed up. My throat started to close at the memory, my heart pounded painfully against my aching chest, echoing loudly in my ears. Damn it. I shouldn’t have even thought his name. 
	“Saturday works,” he smiled but with less enthusiasm. “Do you care though if we go to a party? I promised Phoenix I would stop by at his thing Saturday night while his parents are at some bizarre-o nudist colony.”
	“Nu-uh,” I laughed. Chase nodded, his eyes glittering with the gossip. I had to meet Phoenix’s parents sometime. They sounded kind of awesome. Just hopefully they weren’t nude all the time…. “No, that will be fun!” I threw as much enthusiasm into my voice as I could and leaned forward to brush Chase’s cheek with a kiss.
	“Yeah, fun,” Chase agreed but I could see a hint of disappointment in his expression. “If you don’t want to go though, I can always make an excuse. I mean, if you want our first date to be special. I hate that it’s just going to be a house party.” And that’s why he was disappointed, he wanted to woo me and a high school kegger didn’t exactly scream romance.
	I smiled again to hide my relief. If he put effort into this, I was in danger of another breakdown. I was in danger of ruining someone else’s life. A party would be perfect. Just enough distraction without any romance or intimacy. 
	“You’ll get your chance for special,” I murmured coyly. “You can save the fireworks and champagne for our second date.”
	Chase’s face lit up with my suggestion, his blue eyes shining with future promise. “Deal.” 
	“Deal,” I repeated and then moved for the door. I was dreading going upstairs, completely opposed to the idea of putting myself in the lion’s den, but I had run out of excuses to sit in Chase’s car. “Thanks again for the ride.”
	“Anytime, you know that,” Chase said seriously. 
	I gave him one last wave as he pulled out of the circular drive that rounded a string of midtown apartment buildings and businesses and a sprawling park that tumbled down in front of the modern architecture. The park used to be the home of every homeless person in the city, but when the city remodeled this part of the downtown area, they kicked the bums out and made this section classy and upscale. The bums scattered further east to the heart of downtown and the no bigger than two bedroom condos filled in with rich couples and eligible bachelors. My mom loved this area because she felt hip and important. I loved this area because I felt like it was hiding a filthy, dirty, secret past. 
Just like me. 
With a deep, fortifying breath, I walked into the modern elegance of my building and took the elevator to the top floor, preparing myself for the worst. The shiny elevator doors opened and I crossed the quiet, empty hall to our sprawling two bedroom apartment that overlooked the park and downtown Omaha. 
I let myself in quietly and set my keys in a porcelain bowl designated for keys and other junk on the kitchen counter. Mom had decorated the apartment completely modern chic, which meant that every room of my home was cold and unwelcoming, but expensive and looked nice. 
I hated it. 
Not that I would have ever expected my mother to pick out an overstuffed couch and comfortable throw. She wasn’t one of those women that could curl up in front of the fire with a nice book. She never stood still for more than two minutes at a time and the designer heels that were permanently attached to her slender feet would have poked holes in any such couch by now anyway. 
Plus it’s hard to relax when you have a giant stick up your ass. 
But I did wish that my house felt a little bit more like a home. Everything was ivory and robin’s egg blue or some shade of gold. Everything was breakable and easily stained. The appliances were expensive; the electronics were state of the art, the windows were floor to ceiling and the thread counts high hundreds. And everything, every single thing was bought and paid for with some other schmuck’s credit card, including my once upon a time father’s and the string of lovers stupid enough to fall for her charm and long legs. 
Once the door was closed with a final click behind me and the lock had slid into place, I struggled for a big breath; I was slowly suffocating in this posh prison, slowly fading away into the slavery I had been born into. I set my backpack down on a narrow, Tiffany’s suede bench by the front door, and tossed my trendy pilot’s jacket on top. I straightened my shirt, and fidgeted with the hem of my short jean skirt doing my best to delay walking fully into the apartment. 
I could already smell him here, his cologne permeated every inch of air around me. He was man where there was usually only female, he was musk and rich earth where there was usually just floral and fruit. Suddenly my feet felt cemented to the bamboo flooring, my back magnetized to the front door. He was everywhere and I couldn’t make myself walk forward and meet him. Every instinct inside of me cautioned to get the hell out of here, to run. But I was conditioned to repress those feelings, raised to ignore instinct and reason. Hot tears pricked at the corners of my eyes, my nose twitched with the effort not to cry hysterically. I was a wimp. 
“Ivy,” Nix purred as he rounded the kitchen cabinets and came face to face with me. 
I smiled at him, forcing my feet forward, forcing my legs to move. I was a coward and a hypocrite and a terrible, awful person. But I couldn’t do anything but move toward him and step into his open arms. I kissed his cheek, once and then twice on the other side. He held me close to him, his strong arms encircling my biceps and his hard, chiseled chest pressing against me inappropriately. 
“Hi, Nix,” I greeted in what I hoped sounded like a chipper, welcoming voice. I mean, I heard the unmistakable tremble and crack in every word.… but I just had to hope he didn’t. 
“How was school?” he asked. He took a step back and I relished in the space between us. I sucked in a sharp breath, but he was still everywhere, his scent, his cologne, his essence still clung to every bit of air around me, choking the life out of me.
“It was, um, the same.” I met his emblazoned gaze and tilted my chin for an added illusion of confidence.
“Despite what your mother has told you, I could get you into a different school if you wanted me to. I know you’re unhappy where you’re at. Just say the word, and you can join Exie and Sloane wherever they’re at. Enough money will always get you what you want.” He finally released my arms to walk into the open kitchen and poured himself a drink from my mother’s intense alcohol collection. 
“Not necessary,” I said quickly, too quickly. He glanced back at me over his shoulder and his dark eyes studied me for way too long. “It’s just that I don’t want to go against my mom or anything. She wants me at Central, so at Central I will stay.” 
Nix turned around and leaned back against the granite countertop, arms crossed against his chest, his tumbler of Scotch resting in his hand. He was classically handsome with a tall, lean, muscular frame and broad shoulders. His dark hair was perfectly tussled and cut exactly business-man short. His even darker eyes were framed with long lashes and were as intense as they were sultry. He was the perfect specimen of man, enticing, alluring, sexy as hell and absolutely terrifying. Women were drawn to him without reserve or caution, men feared him, my mother worshipped him and I had to hold back my gag reflex. He was vividly evil, the worst kind of human being.
And he controlled my life. He controlled everything about me…. every little thing past, present and future. 
“I like that, Ivy,” he paused to take me in again, his gaze raking over my figure from head to toe. I stilled the shudder that threatened to rip through me, repressing it into the deepest, darkest part of my soul, the part he couldn’t touch. “I like your obedience.” His voice was low and seductive and I didn’t even want to think about what he could be referring to. I couldn’t think about it. The fear of what was left unsaid haunted my nightmares and every waking thought that spun around tumultuously in my head. 
“Where’s my mom?” I asked in a breathy, child-like voice. I wanted to stand up to him so desperately; I wanted to shout at him to stay away from me, not to touch me or even look at me. But I couldn’t. He was all-consuming and demanded respect and I had been conditioned to react to his every breath since the moment I was born.
“She went to see Honor,” Nix explained turning his gaze to the floor to ceiling windows across the room that led out to our substantial balcony. The look of pure, unadulterated hate flittered across his face, and his eyes turned to pools of malicious energy. Waves of aggression rippled through the room as he let his emotions fill up the apartment. 
Finally, even amidst his overpoweringly negative energy, I found some solace in my situation. I was a prisoner, trapped and held without permission. But my sister, my little sister had an actual chance at life. Nix hated that, hated her. But without much of a choice, him and my mother tolerated Honor’s dictator of a father, with the hope that one day Honor would come into full custody of my mother. 
My mother, the renowned and somewhat notorious Ava Pierce, had followed her routine with Honor’s father to the last ounce of successful practice she did with every one of her conquests. She found rich men on their death beds, exploited their loneliness and her exceptional good looks and then wiggled into the last will and testament moments before their final dying breath. It was her way of securing our wealth and my future.
Securing children took an entirely more complicated approach, however, and there was a ton of work that went into the process. She couldn’t just pick anybody. The sperm donors had to pass an entire gamut of criteria and qualifications in order to be considered a viable candidate and then they had to be near enough to death so that they weren’t an issue for much longer, but healthy enough to father a child. It was a disgusting mess of deceit and sin. And somehow my mother pulled it off with me. But with Honor’s father, things didn’t go exactly as planned. He made a last minute miraculous recovery and when he came back to himself it was like my mother’s spell was completely broken. He divorced her and somehow managed to keep custody of Honor. His gobs of money and the female judge overseeing the case saw to that. Now my mother was only allowed supervised visits with his permission. 
This was what kept us in Omaha. My mother had to get Honor back. Her pride, not her motherly love, demanded that she win. Plus, she was a huge embarrassment to our circle because of her failure and lack of ability to secure her offspring. She was biding her time until Honor became her possession. Nix was making sure she followed through. Honor’s father was securing a separate future for his daughter. And Honor was sheltered and protected from it all, while I was caught in the middle, a jaded, shell of a human being. 
I would do anything in my power to protect Honor from this life. I loved her probably more than myself, even though we weren’t that close. I wasn’t allowed to visit her without my mother and it was almost impossible for us to have a conversation with her hanging around. But I adored her, she was my sister, the only person in my life that had no expectations for me, had no hidden agenda or was captured under the curse. No matter what it took, I would always make sure my mother had absolutely nothing to do in Honor’s life. She was eleven now, too young to see what an evil wench her mother was, but still blissfully adoring of her doting father. I prayed it stayed that way. I prayed that she never met Nix and the circus of demented hell he brought with him. 
The silence that fell between us after mentioning Honor was expected. Nobody knew what to say about her. Her father keeping her was unprecedented. Her father denying my mother something that she wanted was absolutely unparalleled. And it drove Nix mad. 
“We’re meeting her for dinner in an hour. Go get dressed, Ivy,” Nix commanded, taking a sip of his forty year old beverage. He continued to stare out the window, his expression a mixture of hateful, concentrated emotions. A trickle of fear slid down my spine in the form of a single bead of sweat and as much as I wanted and needed to protect my sister, I said a silent prayer that none of the feelings swelling inside of him would ever be directed at me.  
I nodded my acceptance of his demand and peeled my feet off the floor, where I swore they had started to grow roots. As soon as the promise of escape from Nix and his ominous presence was offered I took off like I was in a race for my life, practically sprinting to the solitude of my bedroom. 
His deep, melodic voice followed me down the hall and before I could escape to the sanctuary of my bedroom he threw out one last command, his voice no louder than it would be if he were standing right next to me. I heard every word as if he were whispering in my ear. His words snaked around my insides, coiling them tight with revulsion and hopelessness. “I want you on display, Ivy. Wear something that I can appreciate.”
The door closed behind me, like the door to my fears and feelings. I bottled them up, shut them away and locked everything tightly inside of me. I ignored the trembling of my hands and the ice cold feeling of dread that washed through my stomach like acid and foreboding. I was sixteen years old. How the hell was I supposed to deal with that? Process it? Tonight there wasn’t any choice but to obey Nix, his word was absolute law in my life, no matter how much I hated this life or him.
I just had to get through the next two years. Just two years.  
Someday soon he would have no say in my life…. or in my wardrobe.
And I would be able to breathe.

Chapter Ten

	“Ivy,” Nix called out from the other side of my door. I stood frozen in front of my closet in only a lace bra and matching underwear, undecided on what to wear. “Can I come in?” 
	Fear, cold and shrill, chased my blood through my veins. He could come in if he wanted to and there wasn’t anything I could say. I was not really wearing any clothes, but that wasn’t even the most frightening part of this. Nix had seen me like this before, hell, Nix had seen all of us like this before. My terror originated in the fact that my tattoos were completely exposed and I would be so dead if Nix found them.
	“Uh, I’m still getting dressed,” I called back in a quivering voice. I walked over to the door on my tip toes, making as little sound as I could. My breath felt hurried and deafening as I tried to be as quiet as humanly possible. I desperately wanted to disappear, blend into the carpet or dematerialize into the stagnant air of the apartment. I placed two shaky hands against the solid wood of the door and held them there as if I could stop Nix from entering, as if I could stop Nix from doing anything that he wanted.
	There were several beats of silence and I wondered if Nix was processing the real reason I was keeping him out. “Do you need help?” he asked in an almost exasperated voice. There was no perverse anxiousness or even inappropriate curiosity. My mother would be waiting and Nix hated to be late, even for her. My stalling cost him time and money, that was all. 
	I exhaled a small breath of relief. A small, tiny one, almost insignificant. But it wasn’t. It wasn’t trivial. Just a little bit of release, that was all I needed, that was all I wanted.
	“No, I’m just finishing up. I’ll be ready in five minutes,” I answered more confidently than before. I slid one hand down the smooth wood, enjoying the cool, flat feel under my fingers and as quietly and slowly as I could manage I double checked that the door was locked and secured. Another miniscule breath of relief.
	Not that a locked door had ever stopped Nix from getting what he wanted, but tonight I had the desperate hope that what he wanted was not me.
	“Five minutes,” he echoed in a surly command. 
	I moved back to my closet and slipped inside, digging out the tattoo cover up from my secret hiding place. I rubbed it generously on my ribs and wrist and then took thirty seconds to stare at myself in the mirror and make sure everything was hidden. Even though I hoped these parts of my body would always stay hidden, there was no denying the fear I lived with daily of being found out for these small acts of rebellion. I didn’t even want to think about the price I would have to pay. Thank God for Kat Von D and her miraculous cover up products.
	Once the cover up had dried and done its job, I moved back to my closet and selected a nude long sleeve, off the shoulder mini dress with a pretty lace overlay. There was no cleavage exposure, which I preferred, but the dress was short enough and tight enough Nix would be pleased.
	I shuddered involuntarily at my appraisal.
	My red waves were swept over one shoulder in a fishtail braid that seemed complex, but wasn’t and my makeup was fresh and clean. I slipped into some nude, studded pumps and added a long, dangly necklace. I stared at myself for two more minutes, giving myself the pep talk, pumping myself into handling the next four hours and then grabbed my phone before meeting Nix in the living room.
	He was staring out the window, taking in the city skyline. His reflection was mirrored in the clear pane, his expression intense and serious. He didn’t turn automatically to greet me and so I stood awkwardly leaning against my doorframe, waiting for him to notice me. His broad shoulders were covered with a perfectly fitted navy blue suit, and his hair was expertly styled. I studied his profile more from raw hypnosis than conscious desire. His jaw line was chiseled and strong, his nose the perfect accent to his striking face, his dark eyes penetrating and always passionate. He was gorgeous, that much was undeniable. He screamed masculinity, testosterone and dominance. A shaky breath and nerves that felt like tiny grenades setting off inside my blood reminded me that evil could easily be deceptively and blindingly beautiful. 
	That was Nix.
	Dazzling. 
	And wicked.
	The worst kind of wicked.
	He finally turned to face me, fiddling with one of the four buttons on his cuff. He wasn’t wearing a tie and had left the button open at the collar of his crisp white oxford. My nerves calmed some at the sight of his perfection and the feeling of how he commanded every room he stood in, how he stood out from the rest of humanity like a god sent from Olympus. That kind of outward perfection was inherently flawed on the inside.
	He had to be.
	Or I would never survive.
	My hand instinctively flew to my ribs and where the scrawled words I had picked so carefully were etched into my skin. His eyes bore into mine from across the room, the intensity of his entire aura stealing my breath, hazing my vision.
	“I’m ready,” I announced. I met his gaze and defied logic by holding it. 
	“I see that,” he murmured, stepping towards me. He took the room in four confident strides and was only two inches in front of me before I could even regret the bravado I tried to pull off. “You’re lovely tonight.” His voice floated around my ears with a deep, rich sound, one that demanded melting and fawning. But I couldn’t give in, not even a little bit. His voice was dangerous. 
	“Thank you,” I replied because that was what I was taught to say.
	“Your mother is waiting,” he whispered regretfully. What he was regretting I didn’t even want to speculate, so I took the arm he had offered me and let him lead me out the door and down the elevator. 
	His sleek Jaguar C-X75 was waiting for us in front of the building. He opened the door for me and helped me slide onto the luxurious leather seat. I hadn’t bothered with a coat and I had forgotten my purse, so I fiddled with my cellphone idly while I waited for Nix to climb into the driver’s seat.
	Nix put the car into drive and eased out of the circular driveway in front of our building. We headed north, away from downtown and toward Dundee, a quaint section of Omaha with expensive bistros that served uniquely world class food. It wasn’t that long of a drive, and silence filled the space between us. Nix was intense while he drove. Nix was always intense and never tolerated idle conversation unless he absolutely needed to. I was intimidated and anxious, so silence was fine with me. 
	My phone buzzed in my lap, but I ignored it. If Exie or Sloane were texting about Nix or really anything right now, I didn’t want him to get curious. I was more afraid that it was Chase though. We exchanged numbers yesterday and I didn’t want to have to explain too much about him to Nix. There would be too many questions, too much investigation and if Nix asked me to do anything in regards to the relationship I would have to say yes. And I wasn’t ready for that.  
	Nix found a parking spot directly in front of the restaurant, which I thought was lucky, but probably normal for someone like him. The very best of life just fell into his lap, he was used to it, expected it even. I stayed put in the car while he climbed out and walked around to open the door for me. Years of training had taught me how to behave properly; I was a prisoner to manners and tradition.
	And the curse.
	Just like Nix was.
	My mother was already seated at a table inside the dimly lit French restaurant. She stood when we walked in the door, greeting us each with a gentle hug and a kiss on both cheeks. Her eyes flitted over me from head to toe and I forced myself not to cringe from her scrutiny. She was of course, above reproach in stylishly cut, high waisted black tailored pants and a soft pink silk shirt. She looked more like a movie star than a mother. That was always my thought about her. She was stunning, completely elegant, poised and absolutely untouchable and distant. 
	Eventually, the beauty would fade, she would develop wrinkles, and her hair would thin and gray and her body would begin to sag. It happened to every woman, we were without exception. But my mother would never lose her allure; men would always be drawn to her. 
	And to me. No matter how I detested this outward beauty, men would always worship it. 
	“How’s Honor?” Nix asked first while we settled behind our menus, and they sipped their wine. 
	My mother paused for too long. She made a show of drinking her wine and looking around the restaurant impatiently for our waiter. I clenched at the napkin in my lap, dreading whatever had my mother so nervous. Her eyes flickered everywhere in the room, except to Nix and this only made me more anxious. 
	“She’s very devoted to her father,” she finally admitted.
	A rush of air expelled through my mouth and I felt myself visibly relax into my seat. Nix shot me an intolerant glance, but I smiled brightly, hoping to avoid an explanation. I loved that my sister had a father and they were so close. I loved that she had been saved from our world, from my mother…. From Nix. But obviously I couldn’t explain that to them.
	Nix slid his wine glass between his thumb and middle finger slowly. He didn’t have very many tells, his ability to mask every emotion was one of his greatest skills. But his fingers were white with the effort to stop himself from crushing the glass between his fingers. 
	I wiped at the corners of my mouth to keep from smiling at his frustration. “So she isn’t willing to go back to trial?” I asked in a meek voice.
	My mother’s sharp green eyes found mine with such intensity that it felt like she slapped me. “No, she doesn’t want to dispute custody. She says she’s happy with the way things are.” My mother’s words fell off her tongue like malicious drops of acid. How dare one of her children be happy…
	Nix’s gaze bore into my mother like he could change the finality of her tone with a powerful look. His lips had formed a tight frown and I watched, practically mesmerized, by the pulsing, angry vein in his neck. When he finally spoke, his words were carefully controlled and measured. This was Nix with barely concealed anger management issues; this was Nix just at the verge of losing control. Terrifying. Captivating. Deadly.
	“She doesn’t know better, Ava,” he finally relented. “She’s been with that man for as long as she can remember, she doesn’t know life differently. Continue how things are, we’ll work on the details together.”
	My mother nodded curtly, as if she were in complete agreement. It was only the tremble of her fingers when she reached for her glass that gave away her internal fears. I found her quiet terror comforting, even though it meant that if my plans failed in the future I would be imprisoned to a life of fear. 
	“But I will not tolerate this for much longer,” Nix continued, “Your failure to possess your own offspring is not acceptable. Her father is an anomaly, I understand that, and I’d rather not risk exposure by pressing him too hard. But there cannot be loose ends, there cannot be….” Nix cleared his throat, pulling himself back from the hateful monster he was becoming.
	“So you don’t think that could ever happen again?” I asked before I could stop myself. Ryder had felt like this giant impossibility ever since I met him, but I had forgotten Honor’s father was also completely resistant to my mother’s spell. Maybe there were men alive that could resist us. Maybe there was hope! 
	“Ivy you have nothing to worry about,” Nix answered, misreading my curiosity. “What happened with Smith was a fluke. It won’t happen again, especially not to you.” His eyes settled on me appreciatively and I could almost feel my mother’s bitterness radiating between us. 
	What he didn’t know was that I thought it had already happened to me. 
	My mother wasn’t alone. And I could solve this new gap between us caused by Nix’s implications if I were honest with her about Ryder. 
	But I never would be. Never ever. 
	“Smith and Honor are extenuating circumstances,” my mother defended herself. “Who knows what those chemo drugs did to his mind, to his brain. Nobody expected him to survive those treatments or his disease, not even his expensive team of experts.” We sat in silence as my mother’s unnecessary argument settled around us. I didn’t have an opinion that could be said out loud about her situation and no matter what my mother said, Nix had his own ideas that would not be dissuaded. “Maybe I should talk to my lawyer about that. Maybe it just wasn’t his relationship with me that was affected. Nobody knows the long-term effects those drugs could have on his mental capacity.” 
	Nix made a noncommittal sound and gestured for the waiter to come over and take our order. Nix proceeded to order for all three of us without asking our opinion, and then dismissed the waiter just as abruptly. I was used to this. It was annoying, but I was used to it. And at least I wouldn’t have to eat dry lettuce, my mother’s favorite food.
	We sat in silence for a few more moments, lost to our own thoughts. Nix’s concentration never softened, and if anything he grew more agitated with each passing moment. He was wound tight with powerful energy, his eyes burning holes into the table as his fingers worked his wine glass in small twists back and forth. My mother seemed to shrink under the force of his intensity and I could only watch with sick fascination, hardly knowing what to expect. 
	“Ava,” Nix looked at my mother over the small candle in the middle of the table, the dark lighting of the restaurant casting a shadow over half of his face. He pinned my mother to her seat, leveling her with the concentration of his dark eyes. Before he said anything else I knew she would agree to whatever he was about to say, she couldn’t help herself. When faced with a force of nature like Nix, one did not say “no,” one simply shook her head and quivered in promises to carry out his wishes. “It’s important that Honor is put in your custody soon.” 
	“I know that, Nix,” my mother crooned confidently, but I saw the way she pressed her lips together to hide her nerves. Her attempt at hiding her anxiety was slipping quickly. She needed more wine. 
	“Honor needs to be your legacy, not Ivy,” Nix continued and I choked on a piece of ice I had been crunching on. Literally, I choked. I flailed my arms, chugged my water and made an entirely unattractive spectacle of myself. My mother and Nix waited for me to gain control of my motor functions and breathing with disapproving glares.  
	“Sorry,” I squeaked, looking intently down at the beige table cloth and wishing I could crawl underneath the table and hide or find a gun. A gun could solve a couple problems right now.
	“Why not Ivy?” my mother asked defensively, showing the first sign of backbone I had ever witnessed. And the first sign of a possessive connection to me. “She’s grown into a stunning young woman. She’s everything you want in your legacies and more.”
	“I’m not arguing with you,” Nix was quick to respond, waving his hand in the air for effect. “You’ve done a fantastic job with her; she’s everything I could ever hope for.”
	Except for my mental instability, I thought dryly. 
	“Then-” my mother started to ask, but Nix interrupted her.
	“I want her for me. I want her in my collection,” Nix explained as if this were typical dinner conversation, as if my world hadn’t come crashing down around me at his words, as if I could still breathe. 
	My mother looked over the table at me, beaming with pride. Her green eyes sparkled and her shoulders bounced a little relishing the news. I realized too late that she was never defensive of Nix’s opinion of me, her pride had been wounded. She was soaring now, what with a daughter handpicked for Nix’s personal collection, how could she not be? This was what every mother wanted, what every mother dreamed of her daughter becoming…. 
	But what about the daughters? What about what they wanted? 
	And my heart stopped beating. I stopped living. I stopped existing.
	“Nix, I had no idea Ivy had made such an impression on you,” my mother gloated.
	“When?” I croaked. The word tumbled from my lips in a hoarse, desperate plea for time. 
	“When you would have come to me anyway,” Nix explained, his eyes drinking me in with a calculating indifference. He wasn’t happy with my reaction, with how my face had paled, and my hands gripped the table to keep myself from falling out of my seat. But this was the best I could give him; this was my last desperate attempt from falling apart. “I won’t ask you to leave your mother just yet. But you will be mine, Ivy.”
	His words sunk into my skin like deathly sharp daggers, cutting and slicing open every vestige of hope I held. I bled despair and anguish from every pore, and cried invisible tears of defeat. Eighteen was more important now than ever, but never more unattainable.  
	The dinner continued on without me present, at least intellectually. Nix and my mother moved onto different, less life-changing topics. But I remained in the soul-wrenching limbo of suffocating hopelessness. 
	There was no point to breathing anymore. There was no need for air.

Chapter Eleven

You will be mine, Ivy. You will be mine. You will be mine. You will be mine.
“Hey are you, okay? Ivy, are you okay?” Kenna’s voice cut through the memory of last night and shook me into the present.
Breath.
One full breath. 
	“Um, yeah, I’m fine,” I smiled at her, hoping I looked fine. Obviously I didn’t, but to be fair, she caught me in the middle of reliving the worst nightmare of my life. And I had lived a lifetime of nightmares. “I was just thinking about something.”
	She smiled back, but I could tell she didn’t really believe me. I relied on our acquaintance-only-status to keep her from prying further and with one more fortifying breath I turned my attention back to Chase as he inhaled his pizza. I reached over and stole a pepperoni before he could consume everything on his plate and then ignored the instinct to lick his plate clean for him.
	“I tried to share with you,” Chase scolded. He wiped his hands on a napkin and gave my lonely orange and bottle of water a depressed once over. “That is so not enough food for lunch.” 
	“It’s plenty,” I argued, savoring the taste of the greasy pepperoni on my tongue. “I’m just not a big eater,” I explained. I wasn’t a big eater, but not by choice. It was part of the rules I lived with. I wanted to be a big eater. I wanted to weigh four hundred pounds and eat ice cream all day long and drink soda by the two-liter.
	I wanted to wear elastic pants. 
	Chase made a noncommittal grunt that sounded like he didn’t really believe me either. I ignored him and dug into the orange in front of me, my fingernails sinking into the soft flesh causing juice to squirt out everywhere, speckling my hands with sticky spray. 
	“So who’s coming tomorrow night?” Phoenix asked by way of greeting. He sat down directly across from me, flashing a goofy grin and waggling his eyebrows. “Ivy, you in?” 
	“Yeah, I’m in,” I grinned back and nudged Chase with my elbow. “Chase invited me.” 
	“Nice,” Phoenix’s smile grew bigger and he reached out with his gangly arms to steal my water bottle and take a drink. Apparently our lunch table was more like a communal buffet. 
	“Wait, is this the first date?” Ryder asked, squeezing in between Phoenix and Kenna. He threw his arm around Kenna and placed a quick kiss against her neck before waiting for an answer. I watched them helplessly, feeling something hollow open in my heart but not understanding it. 
	Kenna giggled loudly and then wiggled out of Ryder’s arm so that she could finish her lunch. She really was pretty, even today when she wasn’t really trying. Her stick straight hair was thrown up into a messy bun, but it was so straight that it fell limply on top of her head. She was wearing a simple V-neck t-shirt and tight jeans with a loose scarf around her neck, but she was still eye-catching, still beautiful. 
	I found myself jealous for a moment. Not because I didn’t think I was pretty, I knew I was. But each one of my outfits had to meet the approval of my mother and anything less than perfectly styled hair was completely out of the question. Even the ballet flats I wore today with skinny jeans took hours of convincing and negotiating. My mother was under the impression that unless I was in at least four inch stilettos I just wasn’t trying. 
	I tore my eyes off Kenna to stare at Chase, expecting him to answer Ryder’s question. He blushed just barely, his cheeks pinkened and his eyes averted me completely. 
“This is the first date,” I acknowledged, saving Chase from having to answer. 
“F for effort,” Ryder goaded. “Don’t get too attached to that one, if the best he can come up with is a lame-ass party at Bates’ house.”
	“It’s my fault,” I felt the unexplainable need to defend Chase from Ryder’s judgment. “I’m busy tonight and he had already promised Phoenix he would go.” 
	Ryder gave me a skeptical look and I wasn’t exactly sure what it was for, but Chase jumped in and saved me from asking. “Like you’re any better Sutton. You’re taking Kenna to the party, yeah?” 
	“Yeah,” Ryder agreed. “But tonight I have big plans.”
	“Oh yeah?” Kenna nudged Ryder with her elbow gently. “What kind of plans?”
	“Big ones,” Ryder smirked at her, and the innuendo was clear. 
	I felt my cheeks get warm and I had to avoid any eye contact at the table while everyone snickered and laughed around me. I didn’t know why I felt so embarrassed by Ryder’s comments; it wasn’t like my life was protected from sex, or sex-related activities. In fact, it was more inundated with them than anything. But I didn’t like to think about whatever Ryder had planned for Kenna tonight. For whatever reason those thoughts made me extremely uncomfortable.
	“Hey,” Chase lowered his voice and leaned into me. “We don’t have to go to the party. We can always do our own thing.” 
	“No, you can’t,” Phoenix jumped in, shaking his head and giving Chase a stern look. “No, you can’t do your own thing. Ivy’s never been to one of my parties. They are seriously epic. There will be no ditching my party.” This was the most serious I had ever seen Phoenix, and he was still glaring at Chase. 
	“Geez, eavesdrop much?” Chase complained, shaking his head at his friend. “And you can’t peer pressure Ivy into going, she makes her own decisions.” 
	“Very true,” I laughed at the two of them going back and forth. And it was true. I was completely immune to peer pressure. Parental pressure was a whole different category however and in my case, so, so much worse. “Don’t worry, Phoenix, we’ll be there.” I turned to Chase and smiled at him. “I don’t want to disappoint him, he seems so pathetic.” 
	Chase just shook his head. “How do you always get your way, man?” 
	“Boyish good looks and infinite charm,” Phoenix offered seriously. “Oh and my parents have good weed.” 
	I let that sink in for a minute before declaring, “Nope, sorry, so not into recreational drugs.” I shook my head, my auburn hair whipping around my face, hammering in my point. I didn’t know what made my confession so absolutely vital, so important that I needed to say it out loud with loads of conviction. But I had to assume it had something to do with Kenna presuming my drink the other night was vodka. I had a reputation, and I couldn’t stop the rumors, but this group of people was different from anyone I had ever hung out with before. They were better…. more wholesome or something. And I felt myself wanting to prove my virtue. Which was totally lame…. 
	“Oh, no worries,” Phoenix threw out immediately. “The weed is just there, I mean available. Personally, I never do it either, but my parents leave it where all my friends can find it. They think that makes them cool parents. I think it makes them irresponsible, but what can you do?”
	“I don’t believe you,” a snide voice called from down the table. I lifted my eyes to meet the same girl that was mean to me before. I couldn’t remember her name. Initially, I thought she was accusing Phoenix of lying, but by her pinched, hateful face I had to assume her statement was directed at me. “I’ve heard you’re into everything,” she continued, letting her ambiguous innuendo slide over every one of her words.
	“She doesn’t do drugs anymore. Rehab, duh, Amber,” another voice from down the table scolded but with a fair amount of amusement in his annoying voice. 
	Hayden. Ugh. 
	“Oh, that’s right,” Amber laughed like a hyena at my expense. Her chin length hair bobbed around her face and got stuck to her overly lacquered lips. Her eyes glinted maliciously at me.
	That wasn’t the reason I didn’t do drugs. I would never do drugs. Ever. But those were reasons I had to keep private, reasons I couldn’t even admit to myself out loud. Plus, I still had to perpetuate the whole rehab lie anyway. In only three days, I had almost completely forgotten that I was supposed to be a recovering addict. That was one lie that was going to be hard to keep straight. Goodbye wholesome. Hello, nasty rumors. 
	“Yep, the twelve steps and all,” I mumbled half-heartedly. I didn’t even know what any of the steps were after the first one. Admit you have a problem. I knew they involved forgiveness, but that was the only other one I could come up with. I should have probably googled the rest for obnoxious moments just like this. 
	“What does that even mean?” Ryder asked in an amused tone, drawing my attention back to our smaller group.
	“Come on, don’t be a douche too,” Chase pleaded, saving me from answering. It was a good thing too, since I had no idea what I meant by that and I should have known better than to think Ryder wouldn’t call me out on my crap. “Are you alright?” Chase looked down at me and I felt enveloped in his protective care. His hand slipped to my lower back and I instantly felt better in his bubble of white-knighthood. It was really nice to have someone stick up for me, to say something on my behalf. Even if he was a victim in all of this too. 
	“I’m not trying to be a douche,” Ryder said a little bit softer and he drew my attention back to him. I met his gaze from across the table and couldn’t help but fall just a little bit into his silver depths. “Sorry, Ivy. I wasn’t trying to pick on you.” He held me motionless from where he sat; I was more than a little bit paralyzed by the look of sincerity in his eyes. I could see that he felt bad for calling me out, but that was it. There was nothing else there, no hidden desire, no blatant interest, just apology. He was completely immune to me and suddenly every single one of my thoughts was wrapped up in Ryder Sutton and how the hell he could resist me. 
	“Hey, it’s fine,” I shook my head, breaking our stare down and searching for anything else to look at. Chase’s hand warmed my back, setting off anxious feelings of guilt and embarrassment for letting me get so sucked into the vortex of Ryder’s self-control. I settled my gaze on one of my orange peels and began shredding it between my fingers, shrinking a little from these unfamiliar emotions. 
“Sam Evans doesn’t think it’s fine,” Amber half shouted from across the table.
My head snapped up with her accusation. Instantaneously I was consumed with every negative, hateful emotion possible. “Shut your filthy mouth,” I growled, not caring that there was a captive audience surrounding me. “You don’t know what you’re talking about. Don’t you ever say his name again with that much disrespect.” 
Chase’s hand became stiff and still on my back, his whole body rigid next to me. I felt wide eyes burning into me with intense surprise and curiosity. But I couldn’t explain. I couldn’t explain how it was my fault what happened to Sam and that I would have to live with the guilt and sin of that night.
“Did I hit a nerve?” Amber smirked pompously.
“You have no idea what the hell you’re talking about. So I suggest you stop talking now,” I threatened in a low voice. My hands had started to tremble so I clenched them together and hid them beneath the table. My breathing stuttered and staggered in a worthless attempt to draw in oxygen. Black spots prickled my vision and I could only fear the impending breakdown that was swooping down on me between the flashes of horrific memories of that night.
“God, you’re such a bitch,” Amber’s voice bit out from somewhere beyond the craziness playing out in my head.
I felt Chase whisper against my ear, asking if I was alright, but I wasn’t capable of answering him at this point. It was all caving in on me, my control was slipping, and my future was fading away…
“Who’s the bitch?” a strong voice cut through my haze and called Amber out on her bullshit. “Don’t start shit you know nothing about just because you’re jealous.” 
I lifted my eyes to Ryder who was very effectively putting Amber in her place. Her face had paled and her eyes filled with tears at his admonition. I felt the shattered pieces of my soul start to mend themselves back together and I worked to pull in a full breath, filling my lungs and expanding my chest. Ryder turned back to me, his gaze softening, his eyes searching. 
“She’s been trying to hook up with Chase for two years,” Ryder explained in a loud enough voice that I knew this was still directed at Amber. “She’s jealous of you.”
I nodded because that was all I was capable of. Ryder held my eyes for half a minute more before turning back to a stunned Kenna. He went back to engaging her in conversation, giving her every ounce of his doting attention. Slowly quiet chatter grew around us and everyone at our table seemed to move on. I leaned into Chase, enjoying the strength of his chest against my back, relishing in the warmth of his body pressed against me. 
I would survive this.
I had to.

Chapter Twelve

	“Finally!” Sloane called from the top of her staircase when my mother and I walked into her midtown French Beaux-arts design house. Her mother had drastically different taste than mine. Where my mother worshipped at the altar of modern chic, Sloane’s mother was all classic French doors and imported antique tiled floors. The house was a magazine spread waiting to happen, with expertly decorated classic French furniture and a drool worthy backyard grotto complete with a cozy fire pit and sunken fifteen-person Jacuzzi.  “Up here now!” She snapped her perfectly manicured fingers impatiently and I couldn’t help but smile. 
	“Geesh! You are so bossy!” I called back, feeling a weight lift off my shoulders. I hated being here tonight. I loathed being surrounded by these people, by these women who had sold their souls to the devil without putting up any kind of fight. But I loved my girls. And it was good to see them.
	“Ivy,” my mother stopped me before I could hang up my coat and disappear into Sloane’s bedroom for the rest of the night. Her voice was poised and authoritative, her glassy green eyes narrowed and expectant. “I expect you to put in some face time tonight. You heard what Nix has planned for you. He won’t want you to hide away. You need to remind him and everyone else why he would pick you. It’s not public knowledge yet, but when he makes his claim to you I don’t want there to be a shadow of a doubt for why he would pick you.” 
	She leaned forward to straighten the neckline of my mandarin collared sheer shirt dress. She brushed invisible lint off the shoulder and then adjusted it so that it layered over the dress-length slip perfectly. I willed myself to be still underneath her ice cold fingers and intense scrutiny. 
	“Mom, nobody will notice,” I argued doing my best to keep the pleading tone I desperately felt out of my voice. “It’s not like Nix is going to announce his intentions tonight.”
	“Don’t argue with me,” she chastised immediately. “And please, Nix’s affection for you has never been anything but common knowledge. Do you think anyone else could have pulled that little depression stunt last spring and gotten away with it?” My mother laughed derisively, completely and effectively putting me in my place. “Hardly. So don’t you dare seem ungrateful tonight. Get your act together and give Nix what he wants.”
	“Yes, mother,” I ground out obediently sounding like a Stepford robot. I knew there was no point arguing what might as well have been a command straight from God in this circle of delusional people. 
	She gave me another head to toe dissecting glance, pausing a little too long on my solid black leggings like they were an eye sore. And then she turned her back on me to greet her…. colleagues. I looked around the elegant rooms of Sloane’s house, each one exquisitely designed and furnished. The house cost the same as our condo which could have reflected badly on Sloane’s mother Thalia. Our circle was entirely wrapped up in price tags and paychecks. But where Thalia had been frugal with the house she had made up for with extravagant pieces of art and design. 
The first floor of Sloane’s mother’s house was filled with women just like my own mom, gold-diggers all vying for Nix’s desired attention. Not that Nix would ever be an end all for these rich bitches, but he had his own charm and appeal that was absolutely intoxicating to these women…. to every woman. Nix floated between clusters of beautiful but conniving females, dazzling them all with his charm and wit.  
	I had a sudden urge to vomit all over the antique ottoman to my left, just to cause a scene. Obviously I squashed the urge, but the bitterness stayed firmly lodged in the back of my throat.
	I took one more brave look around the first floor from my vantage point in the foyer, swearing to myself that I would never become these women, that I would never let myself get swept away in the shallow-possession-coveted existence that poisoned them. I lifted my chin in mild defiance and let the promise to myself weave a protective layer around my cynical, jaded soul, and around my broken, malformed heart. I was better than this. I was better than this life. 
	Nix caught my eye from across the room, his dark eyes hypnotizing me, his allure calling to me, asking me to stand by his side. He hardly acknowledged me other than the way he kept his gaze tightly locked with mine, not even a head nod or incline of his chin. But it was because of the subtlety of his authority that I felt the call to him stronger than even the oxygen in my lungs, more intimately than the blood pumping through my veins. I held my ground and fought with everything I had against the intense desire to walk over to him. His lips quirked into a perceptive smirk, and I felt his expression turn to knowing. It was like my defiance only spurred him on, only encouraged him. More afraid of that truth than anything else, I broke our gaze and bounded upstairs and to the safety of Sloane’s room. 
	“There she is,” Exie squealed. “Shut the door behind you, Ives.”
	I followed her directions and plopped down on Sloane’s oversized bed. Her room was decorated in the same style as the rest of the house, light and airy with touches of eighteenth century France. Every piece of her ivory painted provincial bedroom set was occupied in some way by Sloane, Exie or their sisters Evaleen and Anaxandra.
	Exie was at the vanity curling her sister Anaxandra’s hair. She had long golden curls, just like Exie and icy blue eyes framed by impossibly dark lashes. They were big-boobed Barbies with tiny waists and perfect manes of hair. Anaxandra watched disinterestedly as Exie arranged her hair in a perfect mess that would appear casual even if it had taken several hours to accomplish. 
	Evaleen, Sloane’s sister shared her pale complexion and deep, dark brown eyes, but her hair was more chestnut than Sloane’s rich almost black hair. Evaleen was definitely Snow White’s older sister, and not the fairy tale princess that Sloane was, but she was still breath-taking, still heart-stopping. All of these beautiful girls could give anyone an inferiority complex.
	That is if you weren’t equally as beautiful and acutely aware that this kind of splendor came with an insipid, disgusting price tag you would have to pay for the rest of your existence and never, not once, not even in your outspoken fantasies or most private hopes and dreams have the opportunity to be free.
	“Hey, Ivy,” Evaleen greeted in a falsely casual tone. She lifted her eyes from a gossip magazine and pinned me with an accusing stare. “It’s been a while. How was the…. what are you calling it? The mind-vacation?” 
	I gaped at her. She was speaking to me with barely hidden cruelty like she was accusing me what happened was my fault. She should know better. We were all brought into this together, the same way. We used to be in this together. But apparently Exie was right, these two girls that I used to look up to as heroes had bought into the lie. 
	Everyone in the room was waiting for me to say something, staring at me with jewel-like eyes and practiced expressions of curiosity. 
	“Rehab,” I finally whispered, my own voice failing to stand by my side. “I’ve just been telling everyone I went to rehab.”
	Anaxandra snorted her disapproval. “Not a very flattering lie. Fat camp would have been better than rehab.”
	I swallowed my righteous rage at her callousness and decided to save the “beauty is on the inside” fight for when it actually aided my case. In fact, all of my beauty was on the outside. All of it. So it didn’t really matter if I wanted to argue with Anaxandra or not, she would clearly win this argument. 
	“But rehab isn’t really a lie,” I replied pathetically. “At least not if you hear Nix or my mom talk about it.” 
	“What was it like?” Evaleen asked, sliding down from her perch on Sloane’s long gilded dresser. “Was it really intense?”
	“Yes,” I admitted. I hadn’t even had this conversation with Sloane or Exie yet. I preferred never to think about my time in the posh brain-washing camp I had been sent to. Most of the time I believed my soul was still intact, well, small pieces of it, but there were moments of weakness when I wasn’t so sure they hadn’t penetrated my mind. “Lots and lots of therapy. And Nix had several veterans visit and share their success stories with me. I guess he was trying to sell me on this whole thing.” I gestured around the room lazily, as if Sloane’s room summed up our entire existence. 
	“Spa time?” Anaxandra pushed, probably noticing my glowing skin and manicured nails, both of which I had chosen to neglect before I went in. I nodded my answer. She sighed enviously. “It sounds like vacation. What I wouldn’t give for Nix to pamper me like that!” 
	Evaleen squealed with laughter, “No kidding. Six months of constant relaxation and spoiling. It sounds amazing! Was it amazing?”
	“No, obviously not.” I looked at these two girls that had just as much influence in raising me as my mother did and could not believe how far gone they were. They were five years older than me, which was an insane amount of time in my life. It was the difference between fighting fate and accepting it. They were almost finished with college, about ready to enter our society completely and they couldn’t stop going on and on about spa time? Everything in their lives already replicated a vacation from reality and still they wanted more? I wondered who they were at the core of their beings; how far down the morally deluded path to hell had they really fallen? 
Evaleen once pulled me aside at a garden party when I was thirteen and slipped comfort inserts into my four inch pumps when she could tell I could barely walk straight anymore. She whispered in my ear when I turned fourteen and had to go to dinner with Nix for the first time by myself that I would be okay, that I was strong enough to handle a four course meal and when dessert was over to simply tell him that I was exhausted and had school in the morning and couldn’t be out any later. She had shown me one of Nix’s greatest weaknesses, that he was a gentleman to a fault in public and nothing would come between him and keeping up appearances. 
And Anaxandra had been the closest thing to an older sister I ever had. She tweezed my eyebrows for the first time, taught me the tricks of well-placed duct tape and Band-Aid placements and never let me cry in public. Never. She would somehow see tears form in my eyes from across entire ballrooms, race to me, scoop me up and hide me in the nearest bathroom until the tears stopped and she could reapply my makeup. I was gone six months and came back to Invasion of the Body Snatchers. I came back to sell-outs. The reality of that epiphany was like a slice to my already battered heart. What if that was me one day? What if I forgot all my moral high ground and coveted convictions and allowed the idea of spas and vacation to completely cloud my judgment? That was the scariest question of all. 
“I was still processing Sam… It was kind of the opposite of a vacation.” I breathed out in a shaky whisper. 
	“Oh, my god, Ivy, get over it already. It’s not like he died. You are being so dramatic about the whole thing!” Anaxandra rolled her huge blue eyes in an exaggerated circle and then removed her attention from me completely, looking down at her nails as if they held the solution to world hunger. 
	Exie smacked the back of her sister’s head with a sharp satisfaction. “God, Ana, that is the ugliest thing you have ever said! What is wrong with you?” 
	“Ow!” Anaxandra rubbed at the back of her head and scowled at her little sister. “What is wrong with you? And you know that Ivy is the only one upset about the accident. Everyone else seems to think it’s a good thing… a sign of things to come!” Her face lit up with an expectant smile. “You’re a good omen, Ivy. Stop worrying about Sam and enjoy what this means for you!” 
	The bile rose higher in my throat and I lunged forward, throwing myself in Sloane’s bathroom. I didn’t have time to reach the toilet, so I stood at the sink, dry heaving the non-existent contents of an empty stomach. A weighty pressure landed on my lungs and my vision blurred at the edges, threatening my consciousness altogether. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t breathe. 
	Sloane appeared behind me and turned me away from the mirror where I had been unconsciously staring daggers into my own, hated reflection. She pushed roughly on the back of my head until the top half of my body hung upside down and my face was awkwardly placed between my knees. 
	“It’s okay, Ivy,” Sloane murmured sweetly to me. “Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Slowly, that’s it, slowly.” Sloane’s voice held a gentle authority that I responded to immediately. This wasn’t the first time we had been through this routine. 
	The world started to come back into focus even as all the blood rushed to my head and my neck flooded with warmth. Breathing became easier; the sick, venomous feeling slowly receded back to the depths of my black, toxic soul. 
	“Ivy sooner or later you’re going to have to get over this cry for attention,” Evaleen taunted from the other room. “If Nix loses his patience with you, you’re only going to have yourself to blame.”
	“There is something wrong with you two,” Exie scolded as she joined us in the en suite bathroom. “You’re just like everybody else. It’s like you’ve turned into them.” Exie gestured toward the floor, indicating the party downstairs. She hit them with an insult that once upon a time would have really riled them up. “You’ve been drinking the Kool-Aid.”
	“Grow up, Ex,” Anaxandra snarled. “Some of us like drinking the Kool-Aid. One day you’ll get it, you’ll accept what every single one of us eventually comes to accept. It’s easy to be judgmental from where you’re standing, but one day you’ll have to stand in our shoes, one day when they offer you the proverbial Kool-Aid you’re going to drink it. Just like we did, just like our mothers did, just like their mothers did. Remember that.” Anaxandra finished her speech by returning her gaze to the oval vanity mirror and preening for three more seconds before nodding her head to Evaleen. Both girls gave us one more pitying stare and then left to join the party downstairs. 
	The three of us stood silent and frozen in the safety of Sloane’s bathroom processing Anaxandra’s ominous words. Sloane was the first to move and when she did it was with an icy frigidness. She turned around and leaned forward on the bathroom’s marble countertop, gripping the edge until her hands became white. 
	“What if she’s right?” Sloane whispered, avoiding her face in the mirror. “What if we turn out just like them?”
	A hundred different answers spun and twisted in my head but when I finally spoke it was with hope. “What if we don’t?” I paused, letting the question settle in the air around us. “Sloane, what if we don’t?” Each word was spoken with solid intension and earnest strength. There was so much hope in that seemingly impossible future that it was too tempting to set aside without further examination. 
Exie looked up when I spoke, shaken from her fearful trance. There was a lighter spark in her deep blue eyes, a glisten of miniscule hope that hadn’t been there before. “Sloane, what if we don’t?” she squealed and pulled me to her in a tight hug. She bounced up and down and then pulled Sloane into our circle of affection like we had already conquered this life and moved on to greener pastures. 
	I let myself get caught up in her excitement, feeling real hope bloom as the first flowers of spring after an endlessly frozen winter. There was no reason for it, no explanation for why this time my voice sounded confident and sure. But there it was all the same and the three of us were suddenly infected with as much hope as we were once diseased with despair.

Chapter Thirteen

	“Alright ladies, it’s time to make an appearance,” Sloane admonished after several minutes of hugging. 
	Exie and I made simultaneous groans of frustration, but let Sloane lead the way out her door and down the staircase to the main floor. There weren’t that many women gathered tonight, less than fifty. But each room was packed with competitive estrogen and enough ego to suffocate an innocent bystander. 
	Caterers floated from room to room carrying trays of bite-sized canapés or flutes of champagne and soft jazz drifted through the air barely heard over the steady conversation. Men had joined the ranks of women since I was upstairs, dates, husbands, lovers, Nix’s apprentices…. There were not as many of them as there were women, but the crowd was diversified and it put me back on edge. 
	We waved and smiled at everyone important, at everyone we were supposed to pay notice to. But each of us avoided Nix’s authoritative eye and the expectation-filled expressions of our mothers. Exie and Sloane were as uncomfortable as I was dealing with these people and we shared a mutual acknowledgment that a quick walk-through constituted a legitimate appearance. With a sad, soul-crushing kind of despair, I noticed Anaxandra and Eveleen mingling with the veteran women in the crowd, sipping vodka martinis and discussing current events. 
	Another one bites the dust. 
	And another one and another one, and another one bites the dust. 
	We ducked into the den toward the back of the house. The room was unoccupied, but we knew it would be. Personal offices are always off limits at these things, hence the reason we use them as our safe haven. Technically we were still apart of the party. 
We squished together on a rich, chocolate suede sofa surrounded by floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. They were artfully stacked with volumes of intellectual books that had probably never been opened.  Snuggled together and somewhat tucked away, we began our ritual of making fun of everyone we could remember seeing in our brief sprint from the bottom of the staircase to this room. We pulled our cell phones out and multitasked by trash talking and texting. This was the procedure for us, years of routine and tradition.
	“So did that guy ever work out for you?” Sloane asked with a sly lift of her eyebrow.
	“Guy?” I clarified. A surge of irrational panic slid through my veins leaving sticky residual anxiety congesting my blood vessels into immovable blockage. 
	“That one from your first day back? The one that offered you a ride?” Sloane clarified as if I was especially slow tonight.
	“Oh, right. Yes, actually. We have a date tomorrow night. Some house party thing…” I trailed off and then felt the need to defend Chase’s choice of the first date. “He asked me out for tonight first, but obviously I had other plans. So we decided to do this thing tomorrow night because he already told his friend he would be there,” I rambled nervously. “His name is Chase.” For a moment I assumed she meant Ryder, which sent off all kinds of panic alarms in my head. I realized then that I held a fierce desire to protect Ryder from this life, from me… and I didn’t understand where it came from. I didn’t even like Ryder. He was more like this phenomenon in life where everything had become far too predictable. But maybe that was why I wanted to protect him. Maybe because he was all but invincible to my curse, I wanted to protect him from every potential female that could hurt him.
	Which was kind of messed up since he was already saved from being a victim.
	It was all the other boys that lay in the wake of my war path that I should really be concerned about.
	Except I tried that once… I tried that with Sam and things did not end well.
	“I remember,” Sloane grinned, lifting her second eyebrow to join the first. “But a house party? Seriously? I thought I raised you better than that.” She threw me a saucy grin to let me know she was kidding.
	“Well, if it makes you feel any better, he had this whole wining and dining event planned but when I turned him down for tonight he was already locked into this party thing. It should be fun. The guy who’s throwing it is super sweet and funny. And Chase’s whole circle of friends will be there, so….” I trailed off not really knowing where I was going with that or why I was defending the night at all. It was a party, so what? We went to parties all the time. 
	“Aw, I think our little Ivy is nervous,” Exie elbowed me in the ribs from where she sat in between Sloane and me. “You’re rambling a little bit, sweets. Are you scared to go to the party?”
	I thought about that for a minute and decided I was more than scared, I was petrified. It would be my first high school event since the accident last spring. I had plenty of reasons to be nervous, but I was raised to believe that kind of anxiety was a weakness.
	And I wasn’t supposed to have any weaknesses.
	“Maybe just a little bit,” I smiled, hoping my nerves would be misinterpreted. “I kind of like Chase. He’s adorable in that soccer-jock-I’m-so-l-laid-back-I-should-be-a-surfer-way. You know?” 
	“Sure, we know,” Sloane giggled, turning her attention back to the text message she was sending to her boyfriend of the month. “Surfers in Nebraska where there aren’t even any noteworthy lakes, make complete sense.”
	The three of us dissolved into laughter.
	At that moment, my phone lit up with an incoming message and I smiled down at Chase’s name and short note. Having fun at the family thing?  
Chase was a good choice for a first boyfriend back in the game. He was low maintenance and extra sweet. He would be careful with me, even if I would eventually break his heart. He didn’t know it now, but even if he was the best thing for me, I was definitely the worst thing for him.   
	“Speak of the devil,” I mumbled. 
	“And he shall appear,” Nix finished the phrase from the doorway. A chill slid down my spine at his reference and I couldn’t help but picture his dark mess of hair with red horns and his perfectly sculpted hands holding a pitchfork. “It’s hard to enjoy the party when you’re hiding back here, ladies.” He smiled casually at first, slowly, as if he were in on our private joke, but then his expression grew more serious and he hit us with the intense severity of his dark eyes that only Nix was capable of. “Your mothers are all looking for you.”
	We responded without talking, jumping to our feet in trained obedience. I tried to get to the door first, hating the idea of being the last one in the room with him. Not that I was abandoning my friends, but either of them would be safe. Nix wouldn’t try to detain them. Not yet anyway….
	He caught my eye though and with an infinitesimal shake of his head I knew I had been trapped regardless of my efforts. I moved to the side and let my friends through the door. They gave me a discreetly sympathetic look before slipping into the hallway in search of their mothers. 
	“Ivy,” Nix greeted smoothly, piercing me with his concentrated gaze, like a knife in the gut. His expression sliced open my belly, hemorrhaging my insecurities and fears. 
	“Hey, Nix,” I replied smoothly, confidently, casually and with any other positive adverb I could convey. I forced myself to remain the picture of aloof ease, proud and relaxed. With my chin tilted just a fraction higher and my shoulders held back I faced the monster in front of me, silently pleading he would believe my act.
	“I thought I made it clear at dinner last night my intentions for you,” his voice was velvet and silk, assertive and authoritative, enthralling and tempting. It took an expert to notice the thinly veiled threat and strain of pure evil pulsing with each syllable. 
	“You did,” I smiled up at him, letting a hint of confusion show through my carefully constructed mask. 
	“I want you by my side, Ivy. That means tonight. That means every night,” Nix growled out, letting all pretense drop away.
	Forget acting 101, my heartbeat took off in a rapid flutter of nerves, my palms began to sweat and my careful mask of control shattered in front of him. I took a step back, my ballet flats sliding against the polished wood floors with a swoosh sound that cut through the silence of the room like a knife. I hated that my fear showed through, that Nix’s face lit up with satisfaction and predatory delight, but I couldn’t stop the reaction. Even me, a girl who had been raised in this world since birth couldn’t stop the innate fear from rising up like a revolt against my actions when Nix was around. “I-”
	“Don’t,” he cut me off not even allowing an excuse. I should have known better than to believe I could deceive Nix. He leaned against the door jam, tucking his hands into the pockets of his perfectly cut black trousers.  “I’m not in the mood for your games. I’d be a fool not to see how you feel about this…. lifestyle. But I’d be an even bigger fool to let you go. You’re mine, Ivy. I’m not expecting you to embrace the idea, but I’m not going to do anything about it either. I will break you over time, I’m not concerned. And until then I plan on enjoying every bit of your free spirit.”
	I opened and then closed my mouth, only to open and close it again. I had never really been under the impression that I was fooling Nix, but to hear everything laid out so honestly, so openly was more than I could deal with. 
	He continued so I wouldn’t have to flounder. “I don’t expect you to feel good about anything I just said. When you’re as determined as you are, words like mine can only damage your pride. That feeling will fade, I promise. You just need to trust me. And if I were you, I would leave your friends out of whatever rebellion you’re planning. They will be the ones getting hurt, not you. You will only be the one left to carry more guilt around. After Sam, do you really think you can handle two more lives to add to your list?”
	“Are you threatening me?” I whispered in a raspy voice. The heels of my feet hit the wall with an empty thud and I realized Nix had me right where he wanted me. I was the trapped baby gazelle, while the experienced lion stalked his naïve, helpless prey. This was his plan all along, fear as motivation, friends as incentive, threats and promises to perpetuate the cycle. 
	“Hardly,” he sighed, taking a step forward so he towered over me. I felt small and weak next to his intoxicating masculinity. “I don’t have to threaten you because you’re not going to let this get out of hand. You’re going to bend to my will. You’re going to obey me.”
	A loaded silence dragged heavily between us. I wasn’t going to agree to Nix’s outrageous demands and he wasn’t ever going to back off. Not ever. 
	Eventually, he changed the subject. “I don’t like the idea of you going to a party tomorrow night. I think it’s too soon.”
	More silence on my part. This was my job: parties, boys, drunken revelry. 
	“Ivy, I’m not trying to offend your pride,” Nix wisely pacified me. “I’m concerned for your well-being and nothing more. A party…. after the accident last spring, could trigger all kinds of-”
	“Nix, I’m fine,” I interrupted, a sharp, determined edge to my voice. “I know what you’re going to say, but I’m better. The depression, the breakdown... that’s not going to happen again. The crash was just… unexpected. I’m better, Nix. I promise.” I pushed as much commitment and feeling into my words and body as possible. I couldn’t go back to treatment; I couldn’t, even for one second reveal how just not fine I really was. Nix could see through anything, every single one of my lies, but I was hoping this was a lie he wanted to believe. Or at the very least believed he could make true.
	Nix’s eyes narrowed in thought, his laugh lines making a pronounced appearance as he looked me over and waited for me to recant from my knees in pleading supplication. “Ivy, the accident… The car crash… I know you had a soft spot for Sam, but what happened wasn’t necessarily a terrible thing. You could look at this like a sign of great things to come, you could look at this like a-”
	“Nix, don’t,” I whispered desperately. I overstepped my good graces when I dared to interrupt him twice, but I could not bear to hear him put a positive spin on the accident. I destroyed someone’s life, destroyed it. There was no sign, or omen, or great thing to come. There was only me, the destroyer of men’s lives and ruiner of promising futures. 
	“One day you’ll understand, Ivy. One day you’ll see,” Nix promised, his eyes softening with sweet adoration. “Now, come along, you’re by my side from now on.” He held out his elbow for me and I took it obediently. The exposed skin of my forearm slid easily along the silky fabric of his expensive suit. The hard lines of his body were pressed against my side as he led me out to the rest of the party.
	He was dominant strength to my fragile obedience. He was entertaining and lively to my submissive silence. I participated only when directly engaged but played the part of his pretty bobble in every way I was taught to. For now, I was allowed to be sixteen, or as sixteen as any other woman in our circle was ever allowed to be. But if I didn’t do something, if I didn’t escape, I had a lifetime of this to look forward to and worse. 
	Sam’s drunk driving accident would only be the beginning of a never ending list of lives demolished by the notorious Ivy Pierce.

Chapter Fourteen

	My hand shot out from under me with surprisingly fast reflexes since the rest of my body was complete dead weight. The alarm buried in the clutter of my nightstand refused to stop blaring and so with expertly placed force I batted at the snooze button until the incessant bleeping stopped. I squished my eyes closed as tightly as I could and retracted my arm to the snuggled position underneath my tired torso, but it was no use… I wouldn’t be able to fall back asleep.
	Thoughts of the party last night tumbled around in my exhaustion addled brain. And when I was finally able to push those depressing thoughts aside they were replaced with hope for tonight, for a little bit of escape from my reality. Even spending time with Chase ignited an excitement inside of me I didn’t want to admit to. 
	I rolled over in bed, taking the thick, down comforter with me. My hair followed, tangled and wild across my face. I lay there for a few minutes more, letting the early morning light from my wall of bedroom windows seep into my skin and wake me slowly into consciousness. The warmth of the blanket cocooned me in safety and for those few, uninterrupted minutes I felt protected from the rest of my life. I felt safe. 
	But it was a fleeting feeling that drifted away like the forgotten memories of dreams.
I needed coffee, desperately. 
It was that mundane thought that brought reality crashing in around me. My mother was the farthest thing from domesticated as one woman could be, so there was never food in our house, let alone caffeinated necessities. Plus she was a pushy, indoctrinated anorexic. Like those avid PETA supporters that threw cans of red paint on anything fur, my mother looked down at food on my plate with a condescending eye that was almost palpable.
She only ate enough to support her exercise-addiction and fill out her size two cocktail dresses. She expected me to have the same infatuation with non-eating and treadmills. I expected myself to not faint in the middle of the morning because of hunger and add something to my tiny little b-cups. 
So this Saturday morning I was going to rebel with a latte and a pastry.
Maybe even two pastries. 
I lived a dangerous life.
Damn the man.
Or in this case my mother.
I crawled out of bed and rubbed at my still sleepy eyes. I had taken my makeup off late last night and even though it was a pain to go through the beauty regiment my mother had strictly laid out for me, I was thankful now to have a scrubbed face. I tossed my boy shorts and cami on the floor and wiggled into some gray skinny jeans. I grabbed the first bra I could find and then slipped an off the shoulder soft pink cashmere sweater on before pulling my hair into a ponytail without bothering to brush through it. Later today I would take the time for a shower, and blow dry and all that, right now my mind was firmly set on a twenty-four-ounce caramel macchiato and a cream puff. I had tunnel vision and that prompted the single swipe of mascara and lip gloss that constituted my make-up and the ballet flats I left near my bedroom door on my way in last night. 
Not my best effort at looking good, but the coffee shop was only across the street and it was still too early for my mother to have skulked from her own bed and joined the land of the living. She stayed out later than I did, and where my drinks consisted of water on the rocks, her drinks were filled with Grey Goose and Bombay Sapphire. She wouldn’t need coffee. She needed an injection from the fountain of youth to recover from that kind of licentiousness. To be fair though, whenever the women of our circle were gathered together in small quarters like they were last night, they all needed copious amounts of alcohol to forge through the fake friendships and plastic pleasantries. These women did not play well together. 
I grabbed my apartment keys and wallet and slipped out of the house unnoticed. The entire condo complex was quiet and still as I walked to the bank of elevators and waited for one to take me down to the lobby. Our complex was one of many brand new pieces of trendy architecture in this part of Omaha. Sleek, modern and artfully chic, this living arrangement fit my mother’s personality perfectly. I walked out the front doors of our building and through the drive up circle that included a hotel, a posh gym and a fancy restaurant. Across the street stood a three story dine-in movie theater, one of a kind in this city, and a coffee shop recently transplanted from downtown. 
I crossed the street without waiting for the walk sign; there was virtually no traffic this early and not even the shadows of the building fell on the empty street. The autumn sun was bright this morning, warming the chill in the air and igniting the crisp smell of leaves falling from the trees that lined Farnam Street in decorative pots. 
Delice was a European bakery with simply the best orange and raisin scones ever, in the history of scones, and even better fruit tartlets. The small gourmet coffee shop used to live in the epicenter of downtown but when midtown started to rebuild so did Delice. The shop migrated a little west, upgraded their rent and opened for business directly across the street from me. It was love at first sight between the two of us, we were young and lonely and couldn’t get enough of each other. Well, until I was banished until my brain got better…. my long six-month absence stretched out between us like a tragic Shakespearean play. 
But I was back now, and walking through these doors felt more like coming home than well… coming home did. 
The small shop was all but empty, save for an elderly couple cuddled together over the morning World Herald in the corner. I walked straight to the counter so that I could eye the case of pastries up close. The racks were filled with elegant, precisely decorated goodies that triggered my taste buds into an immediately hungry frenzy. Yesterday I had 87 ounces of water, a snack sized bag of pretzels, a banana and one arugula and ricotta cheese canapé. 
Oh and a half glass of champagne that went straight to my head. 
I deserved to eat this entire case of unnecessary calories as far as I was concerned. I wiped my thumb against the corner of my mouth, discreetly checking for drool and then lifted my head to address the cashier. I hadn’t been here in a long enough time that I didn’t recognize the college-aged hippy across the counter. But then most of the girls that worked here were imported from the local universities and so job turnover flowed with the school schedules and breaks. 
“Can I help you?” the dread-locked twenty-something girl asked, but her eyes moved from mine to the door that opened behind me. A smile lit up her face and she gave a tiny wave to whoever just walked in.
“Yes,” I announced, drawing her attention back to me. “I’ll have a caramel macchiato and an orange scone.” The girl started to ring in my confident order and suddenly I felt panicked to add onto it, desperate to break the rules and fill my empty stomach, “And a chocolate croissant.” I cringed at how frantic I sounded, treating this breakfast like my last meal before the electric chair, but that didn’t stop me from throwing in another pastry, “And a cream puff!” 
I reached forward, clutching at the counter until my knuckles turned white. I didn’t want to give up one of the pastries or even any of them, but even as she pushed the right buttons on her computer screen the unwanted guilt of eating such an extravagant breakfast started to sink in through my skin like acid eating away at my resolve. I looked down at my wallet on the counter as if it would have the answers for me, either enough guilt to make me change my mind or enough solace to wipe away the remorse completely. Meanwhile the girl behind the counter rattled off my total without noticing my internal struggle. 
I decided that I really only needed the chocolate croissant and was just about to tell her that when a deep, recognizable voice from behind me spoke up first, “I’ll get that for her Tarryn, just add it to my total.” 
I spun around on my heel, shocked more than I should be to stand face to face with Ryder Sutton. “I can pay for my own breakfast,” I snapped quickly. I trained my eyes on his gunmetal grays, refusing to take in his sleep-mussed hair, morning scruff that outlined his chiseled jaw or the thin black t-shirt and loose jeans that hung on his body deliciously. I simply refused to notice all that.
Besides he was just wearing jeans and a t-shirt. There was absolutely nothing special about his boring outfit. In fact, allowing myself one, tiny, insignificant glance, it looked like he had dug them out from underneath his bed, everything was wrinkled! There was so nothing attractive about that….  
“I never thought you couldn’t buy your own breakfast,” he sighed, already agitated with me. I couldn’t really blame him, but that didn’t mean I dropped my defenses. “I’m just trying to do something nice for you, Ivy.” 
“Is this for here?” Tarryn asked from behind me. 
“Yes,” I replied without turning around. My eyes stayed narrowed on Ryder, not really sure what to do or what to say next. “Thank you” seemed drastically out of the question.          
 “Excuse me,” he strong-armed me out of the way, his sharp elbow connecting playfully with my ribs. A jolt of electricity zinged up my spine and a lone butterfly flapped its nervous wings in my stomach. “You know what, Tarryn, why don’t you hold off on the two regulars and just make my Chai. I’m going to stay and eat breakfast with my friend here.” 
I whipped back around to face the counter, mouth hanging half ajar at Ryder’s announcement. I was assuming he meant me since there was no one else in the café, unless he meant the elderly couple but then I was pretty sure he would have said “friends.” “We’re not friends,” I defended on instinct, more for his sake than mine.
“Fine,” Ryder agreed never looking at me. “Then I’ll be right over there,” Ryder pointed for Tarryn’s benefit, “with my arch-nemesis.” 
My mouth dropped the rest of the way opened and I stifled the hysterical giggle that was bubbling up inside of me. 
“Come on, Dr. Evil,” Ryder called to me, and then took a seat at a secluded table with a view of the street. He had my plate of pastries in front of him and was busy tearing the corner off my chocolate croissant. 
I watched him for a moment as he placed the stolen piece of food in his mouth and chewed on it thoughtfully. His jaw worked at the food, his throat moving once as he swallowed. I tore my eyes from his Adam’s apple just in time to watch his eyes lift under thick eyelashes. He just stared at me, waiting for me to do something, waiting for me to make the next move. Obviously he planned on eating everything on my plate. And obviously I couldn’t let him do that. I settled something in my heart, something that felt like warning, and decided that I was obligated to eat breakfast with Ryder after he paid for it…. and before he could eat it all. 
“Why am I Dr. Evil?” I followed him over, wondering if I had ever wanted to put up a fight. “I should be Inspector Gadget and you should be Dr. Evil.” I sat down heavily on the chair as if I was being held there against my will and forcefully pulled at the plate so that it was more on my side of the table than his.
“Inspector Gadget?” Ryder’s face clouded in confusion and then cleared just as quickly. “You’re thinking of Dr. Claw. Dr. Evil is from Austin Powers.”
It was my turn to be confused. “I’ve never seen Austin Powers.” 
“Are you serious? That’s kind of like a crime against humanity,” Ryder shook his head at me and then reached for my croissant again. 
“It’s not a crime against humanity,” I announced obviously.
“It’s kind of a crime,” Ryder argued. “I can’t believe you’ve never seen Austin Powers. It’s like your life isn’t even complete right now.
He had no idea.
I rolled my eyes at him and then made room when Tarryn brought over our hot drinks. I took a long sip of my macchiato, suddenly realizing what I looked like. I brushed at hairline, pushing back nonexistent frizz. “I think I’ll survive.”
“Well, just to be sure, we can watch it at Phoenix’s tonight. He has the complete set,” Ryder finished decisively. “Really, thinking you’ll survive and knowing you will are two totally different things.”
A thought occurred to me, an ugly, horrible, awful thought and before I could talk myself out of it I had to find out. “Why are you being nice to me?” I blurted out with no tact whatsoever.
	Without even a second to digest my question, Ryder answered, “I’m not being nice to you. We’re arguing about a movie.” 
	I slumped back in my chair, completely dizzy. He was right of course. But arguing also kind of felt like flirting…. not any kind of flirting I had ever done before, not the kind that guaranteed a boyfriend that same day or the kind that would help groom me for my future career... but still, maybe this was a different kind of flirting altogether? A more normal and safe version. Or maybe Ryder was right; maybe we were just fighting over an obscure movie.
	“You look confused,” Ryder noted. He was staring at me over the rim of his Chai Tea. I could smell the strong spices from over here. I felt my insides melt a little at the picture of Ryder, holding his coffee cup with both of his absurdly masculine hands. I imagined his fingertips calloused from playing his guitar and his palms rough like sandpaper. His gray eyes were depthless silver, intense but playful. His lips twisted to a soft smile. This was Saturday morning Ryder, this was relaxed and playful Ryder and my heart started beating double time on instinct. 
	Because relaxed Ryder couldn’t be more dangerous. 
	Good thing he had Kenna.
	Good thing I had Chase.
	Or anybody else I wanted.
	“I was just wondering what you were doing here and how you know the staff so well,” I improvised, dropping my gaze to the pastries in front of me.
	“I know Tarryn because I work here too. I am the staff. I usually work after school though and Sunday afternoons. I’m here now because my dad has been in love with this place since we moved here and even though we live downtown, he makes me bring him coffee every Saturday morning…. and every night after work…. and every Sunday afternoon…. and every time we are in a ten mile radius.” Ryder’s face lit up into a huge smile while he talked about his dad. His home-life happiness was infectious and I couldn’t stop the smile that turned my mouth. I took a big bite of scone to hide my reaction and stared down into my drink. 
	“So does your mom like the coffee here just as much, or is this strictly Mr. Sutton’s addiction?” I asked with a mouth full of food. 
	“Dr. Sutton,” Ryder corrected gently. “My dad’s a music theory professor at the University of Omaha. A doctor of music theory.”
	“Dr. Sutton,” I corrected in a soft voice. “And mom?” 
	“My mom passed away when I was little,” Ryder explained a bit roughly. “So it’s just me, and my dad and my Uncle Matt.”
	“My dad died when I was a baby too,” I announced and then immediately regretted the casual proclamation. I meant to sound understanding but it came out like I was bragging. Or maybe not bragging, but definitely not remorseful. Ryder stared at me from across the table, taking me in. He didn’t offer a reply but his brow furrowed together between his eyebrows like he was seriously thinking this conversation over. Ugh. “Your uncle lives with you?” I asked just to change the subject. 
	“Yeah, he’s my dad’s much younger brother. He’s only ten years older than me and he’s living with us while he goes to college.” Ryder explained, the light returned to his face and I relaxed a little bit into the comfort of having an interesting conversation.
	“So your house is like a bachelor pad? Three guys living together? I can only imagine what your laundry situation is like,” I joked even though my own laundry situation was currently a nightmare. My mother insisted on leaving everything for our housekeeper though and since I didn’t even know how to turn the washing machine on I was inclined to follow at least that edict.
	“Hey, it’s not so bad. My dad has all the chores divvied up. Uncle Matt cleans the house, dad does the laundry and I do the cooking. We make it work,” Ryder’s grin widened and I couldn’t tell if he was joking or telling the truth about the division of work.
	“You do the cooking? Like on a regular basis?” I almost choked on scone. I did not like knowing Ryder could cook, not at all. The knowledge did funny things to my bones, making them clack together at the same time they felt like they were melting into warm puddles inside my skin. 
	“Don’t look so surprised! I can grill a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with the best of them,” Ryder laughed, reaching for what was left of my chocolate croissant.
	“Did you say grill?” So obviously he was joking.
	“Yes ma’am,” he answered seriously. “Are you telling me you’ve never slathered your PB&J’s in butter and then fried them?”
	I shook my head quickly at the disgusting idea. I wasn’t allowed to eat peanut butter ever, let alone slathered it in butter….
	“Ivy, you haven’t seen Austin Powers, you’ve never had a fried PB&J…. I’m starting to seriously worry about you. What kind of life do you live anyway?”
	“You don’t even want to know,” I mumbled unable to keep the depressing truth out of my tone.
	“Speaking of food, this is the most I’ve ever seen you eat. Hangover cure?” Ryder eyed the crumbs on the plate, the only evidence left of my delicious breakfast. 
	“Mmm-mmm,” I contradicted. “I was just hungry. I’m six-months sober remember?”
	“Yep, how could I forget? You act like such a desperate drunk usually,” Ryder sounded unconvinced and skeptical of my alleged stint in rehab and for some absurd reason his cynical tone made my heart swell in my chest, pushing against the cage of my breastbone, flaring hope in the darkest places of my soul. When I didn’t say anything though, Ryder continued in what could have been considered an attack. “But seriously, you never eat at lunch. I thought you were one of those girls with an eating disorder or that thought you could impress boys by how little you consume. Because here’s a piece of advice, boys like girls that can eat entire meals.”
	“I don’t need you to tell me what boys like. And I’m not one of those girls,” I rasped out in a defensive whisper, knowing I basically did have an eating disorder but not because I didn’t see myself correctly or was worried about weight gain. It was my mother and her completely f-ed up view of reality. “I love to eat.” I said that part louder; confidence was easier with truth behind it.
	“So why not at school?” Ryder pressed. “Are you trying to impress Chase? Because I promise you, he could care less what you eat for lunch.”
	“It has nothing to do with impressing any boy,” I argued, feeling myself bristle at his ridiculous accusation.
	“Then other girls? Kenna?” His voice dropped to a concerned whisper. His gray eyes pinned me to my seat no matter how desperately I wanted to bolt from the café. This conversation was awkward and intrusive and there was absolutely no way I could open up to him. Even though suddenly, desperately… I wanted to. For the first time in my life I wanted to explain everything to someone outside of our circle. Those kinds of feelings were stupid and dangerous and yet there they were anyway. 
	“Not Kenna,” I forced myself to hold back the sarcastic bitterness that came out of nowhere. Ryder really thought I would compare myself to perfect Kenna Lee? Not a chance.
	Like his girlfriend was this icon of everything I wanted to be in life. Psht. 
	Still it kind of bothered me how much it bothered me…..
	Ryder looked at me expectantly. He sat waiting for me to open up to him about some fake disorder, like a random breakfast was enough to appoint him my sobriety sponsor. 
	I had enough of counselors during rehabilitation. If you could even call them that…. droves of women constantly coming to Nix’s defense, singing his praise and bragging about his bedroom prowess. God, it was disgusting. And then when we did get down to business, to my issues, there was no real help offered or solutions given. They were sponges that absorbed every last piece of information and sent it right along to Nix. Six months in intensive therapy was merely a tool to uncover every last one of my secrets and scoot me right back to the assembly line with all the other mindless Stepford robots.
	I had every reason to distrust Ryder’s concern and even more so his “listening ear.” Still, the silver in his eyes glinted with honesty; his mouth was pressed into a sincerely grim line. He cared. He actually wanted to hear about my problems. 
	What was even more, it seemed like he truly wanted to help.
	And I wanted to let him.
	I could have compared notes all day long, but Ryder was not one of those brain-washed women that would go running back to Nix the minute I spilled my guts. Ryder was safe. 
	Following a morning of firsts that was the first time in my entire life I had thought that. Never before had I believed someone or something was completely safe.
	A part of me was wholly and utterly shattered by that knowledge and the hope that sprung up with it. The other part of me cowered in fear and shame, just waiting for me to blow this up, to destroy it just like everything else in my life.
	The words were falling from my mouth before I could stop them, “My mom is really strict about what I eat.” 
	Not a lie. And probably the most honest thing I had ever said to a boy.
	“So strict you can’t eat anything?” Ryder tried to joke, but the expression in his eyes never relaxed and his hand slid forward on the table as if he were getting ready to grab mine.
	Whether to run or to hold I didn’t know.
	“Sometimes,” I admitted, hoping it wasn’t too much. I felt myself still underneath his calculating gaze. He was trying to sort truth from my reputation for bullshit. And I didn’t blame him. But I also couldn’t look him in the eye and silently plead with him to let it go, but to also believe me. He was too perceptive, too wise and with one long look at my face I would give away too much. I would open up about everything, about how eating was the least of my problems and that there was so much more to the twisted home life of Ivy Pierce.
	“Ivy, do you want to come home with me for breakfast?” Ryder asked in a soft, sincere voice. His question landed on the table out of nowhere; hitting me hard with a longing I didn’t quite understand. Suddenly his body relaxed into his chair and his hands rested casually as he crossed his arms over his chest. “My uncle always makes a big thing of eggs and hash browns on Saturday mornings. In fact, they’re probably waiting for me now. It’s like his one meal that he can make, and I get the morning off.” I looked up just in time to watch Ryder gesture to Tarryn that he was ready for his to-go coffees. The small café had filled in around us, the later time drawing in all kinds of diversity in the crowd. Some people were clearly still working, despite the weekend, some were family-types on their way to kids’ activities, some were couples in love, some were merely picking up coffee on their walk of shame home, and some were just enjoying their Saturday morning with nothing better to do than sip lattes and eat fruit tartlets.
	I thought about Ryder’s offer, wondering where it came from. Was he taking me home because he thought eggs and mushy potatoes could solve an eating disorder I wouldn’t even talk about with him? Or was he more interested in solving other problems of mine? Because by the way he was staring at me from across the table I could feel how his concern spread roots far deeper than intense dieting. 
	A guy at the counter interrupted his order to let out a low whistle and soft cat call. I turned, distracted from Ryder’s question, but the truth was I felt thankful for the three seconds I was gifted to think this over. “That is one nice car,” guy at the counter remarked, his voice a hushed reverent purr. 
	And just like that I snapped back to the depressing, no-win reality that was my life. Without even laying my eyes on the car I could feel the identity of the driver in the deepest marrow of my bones. A few more manly catcalls sounded out from over the mellow vocals of Over the Rhine playing softly in the background café sound system. 
	Despite the ominous intuition sitting at the base of my spine, I reluctantly gave into curiosity and turned my head just as Nix exited the driver’s side and slid the valet an absurd tip before ducking into the building. I couldn’t actually see the tip, but I knew from experience it would be enormous. 
	“I can’t, Ryder. Thanks for the offer though.” I wanted to investigate Ryder’s reason for inviting me over. Pity? Concern? Actual interest? But with Nix so close my skin started to crawl. I hated the idea of Nix sharing the same city block as Ryder, let alone the same oxygen. And if Nix spotted me over here, no doubt he would make some excuse to spend time with me. Or maybe he wouldn’t even bother making excuses anymore. Maybe we were beyond that.
Something deep and innate warned me to keep Ryder as far from my evil godfather as possible.
I stood up abruptly, anxious to put some space between us and get back home where things were ugly but predictable. “Alright, Sutton, thanks for the coffee, but I have things to do.”
“Sure you do,” Ryder grinned at me as if I was some kind of semi-entertaining side show.
“See you later tonight,” I smiled winningly and turned my back on my breakfast date. 
“Later,” he mumbled. 
I escaped out the door, but my thoughts immediately leapt to the night ahead of me. I should definitely not be as excited about the party as I suddenly was. Ryder was so off limits and not even interested. 
Plus there was Chase.
Ugh. I needed to get my life together. Forget them both. And focus on just surviving the next two years. Focus on my trust fund and how it would change my life. 
Somehow I knew that was way too much to ask.

Chapter Fifteen

	“Hey, gorgeous,” Chase called. 
	I practically ran from the door of my building to meet him at the passenger side door of his car, which was not easy in heeled boots. Nix and my mother were watching from way above us, I knew it instinctively and I was in a hurry to get out of here, to get far, far, far away from them. I gave my most charming smile when Chase opened the door for me and threw my arms around his neck in an exaggerated show of affection.
	“Hey, yourself,” I whispered against his neck.
 	I felt his surprise when our bodies collided, but it took no time for him to return the gesture and wrap his arms around my waist. He stayed the perfect gentleman however and released me exactly on time. I gave him one more happy-grin and then slid onto the cool leather seat. 
	The warm autumn day had turned uncomfortably chilly once the sun went down. If only the full moon offered as much heat as the sun. My pleated, high-waist shorts did nothing to prevent the cold from seeping into my skin, despite the thick charcoal tights I wore underneath them. I hugged my oversized purse to my chest, trying to fight the chill that had seeped into my bones, but it wasn’t until Chase pulled out onto the main street that I felt capable of finding warmth again.
	“It’s good to see you,” Chase breathed a little self-consciously. My gut clenched in frustration. The curse worked fast, I knew that from too many years of experience, and I hated that he was already starting to feel attached.
	At the same time what choice did I have?
	Or he have? 
	“It’s good to see you too,” I replied. “I’m excited for this party! Last night was so awful; you have no idea. I need to get away for a while.”
	“Oh yeah? My family’s kind of crazy too,” Chase laughed. 
	“Not as crazy as mine, trust me,” I sighed. “But what makes your family crazy?” I asked because I genuinely wanted to know; even though I knew I would win a who-has-worse-problems debate, I couldn’t imagine Chase having actual issues with his parents. He seemed way too stable and adjusted. 
	“Ugh, mostly my parents,” he groaned. “They are so stressed out about college, it’s out of control. My older brother went to Northwestern on an academic full-ride and they have equally high hopes for me. But recently I was thinking maybe instead of division one traditional, I would pursue something smaller, something liberal arts focused….” Chase trailed off as if waiting for me to completely reject the idea or at least try to talk him out of it. Since I was basically obsessed with the idea of college and knew I would never get the chance to go I generally tried not to judge other peoples choices. I wasn’t going to start with Chase’s, he knew himself better than I did and besides all that small-liberal-arts-college-thing kind of sounded cool. When I stayed silent he continued, “So anyway, my parents are pretty flipped over that. They don’t think I can get a decent education and especially not a decent job. Last night they bribed me with this insane spring break trip if I would burn all my unapproved-by-them letters of acceptance.”
	I laughed at the absurdity of his parents’ incentive, “What is an insane spring break trip anyway?”
	“Cancun, no questions asked, limitless allowance,” he ticked off as if each idea were more ridiculous than the last. “I don’t want any of that. I want to go to school for something I like, something I’m passionate about. Besides, I don’t believe for one second that my mom could actually not ask any questions. It would be the third degree as soon as I got home and probably an appointment to test for STD’s.”
	“Which would, of course, be smart after an insane trip to Cancun,” I laughed and Chase joined in.
	“You have to know I’m not like that,” he grumbled and I did know. No way was Chase the one night stand with Random Girls kind of guy. Which was going to make this so much harder than I wanted it to be. He had one week left.
	“I know,” I agreed softly. “So what is it that you want to do? What’s at a liberal arts college that isn’t anywhere else?”
	“Uh,” Chase stalled a minute while playing with the dials on the radio. “I’m thinking about Carleton College. It’s in Minnesota so not so far from home, and they have a smaller campus, small classrooms and all that.”
	“Okay,” I smiled patiently at him. “And what would you be learning in those classrooms?”
	He gave me a crooked smile, staring at me with those deep blue eyes of his and flashing his dimples before turning his eyes back to the road. It was like he was deciding if he could trust me or not.
	But the thing was…. he couldn’t.
	Or at least he shouldn’t.
	“Social science,” he finally admitted, sounding completely embarrassed.
	I fumbled with thoughts of how to turn that into career and came up completely empty-handed. “No wonder your parents are concerned for your future,” I joked.
	“Hey now,” he shot me a playful glower and then explained “I want to run campaigns, like political campaigns. Start at the city and state level, like mayoral and state senators and then eventually work my way up to larger scale elections.”
	“One day, presidential?” I guessed. I admired his ambition, his quiet dreams that were held with such obviously fierce resolve. 
	“Maybe,” he answered quietly, his cheeks heating with an embarrassed flush. “One day.” 
	“I love that,” I whispered. And I did. We were silent for a full minute before I announced decidedly, “Don’t take the trip of debauchery. You need to go to Carleton.” 
	His cheeks returned to their natural tanned tone and he nodded his head enthusiastically, “Well, when you put it like that… and just when I had decided to sell my soul for a week of cheap tequila and hookers. Mom will be so disappointed.”
	Laughter burst out of my mouth and Chase joined in. He reached out subtly and grabbed my hand, holding it gently in his. My breath caught in my throat at the super sweet gesture and I relaxed into the leather seat. We drove through a neighborhood close to Creighton University in north downtown Omaha. The houses were big and old here, some pathetically run down, and some immaculately taken care of. Poor mixed with old wealth, multicultural diversity mixed Mexican restaurants, specialized hair salons and ethnic markets. College students layered the area that surrounded Creighton’s brick academic buildings and their brand new soccer stadium. This area was an intense mixture of culture but still it felt exactly like home, like everything that made up Omaha.
“I’m sure your future still holds plenty of opportunity for reckless debauchery. No need to worry.” I teased.
“Oh, I’m not worried,” Chase assured me with mock gravity. 
He pulled the car over to the side of the street in front of a Victorian-inspired two story house. Phoenix’s house had a long front porch painted pastel yellow with a white porch swing that swayed in the cold night breeze. The yard was neatly trimmed where grass was allowed to grow, or in this case die with winter coming soon; but most of the yard was mulched and made into flower beds that held the remains of withered stems and  dilapidated plants. There was a short, knee high picket fence that lined the property and didn’t really make much sense to me. It seemed too short to be of any real purpose and too tall to just be decorative. The front door was open, letting light spill out onto the front porch and cast shadows along the curving sidewalk that led to the house. I could see lots of movement just beyond the screen door, rowdy teenagers making the most of a no-parents-around scenario.
Chase’s hand gave mine a squeeze and I exhaled suddenly. I hadn’t realized how nervous I was for this party until just now. Excited, anxious, even a bit hopeful, but the peer pressure and teenage revelry that waited just beyond the door weighed down my constricting chest. Memories of my last house party, of Sam and our breakup… of everything that happened that night rushed at my emotions like a speeding train while I stayed trapped and tied to the rails, just waiting for it to run over me…. a helpless damsel in distress silently screaming to be rescued. 
	I was kind of pathetic…
“Hey, we don’t have to go if you’re not up for it,” Chase assured me. His voice stayed calm and soothing, completely out of place from the atmosphere waiting for us inside.
“No, it’s fine,” I said quickly, hoping to shake off my own fears as much as his worry over me. “It’s just been a while since… you know… I’ve been around all this.” I gestured vaguely at the house and then jumped out of the car before I could let myself think about this any longer. My hand ripped out of Chase’s in the process and after slamming the car door I stayed put until he could join me. 
When he rounded the car and held out his hand to me again I took it quickly, breathing in the comforting warmth of Chase’s skin over mine. I offered a confident smile that I did not feel and tried to push away all my worry. I just needed to remind myself that I was hanging out with Chase and nothing more. There would be no unnecessary drama tonight, no fights, or breakups or out of control drinking. Phoenix would only throw a completely relaxed, chill party. Nothing like the night of the accident.
A shiver wracked my body, but I fought it down. I found as much strength and control as I could, pulling on the set of skills I saved for when Nix was around and then walked up the little sidewalk to Phoenix’s front door. Without knocking we entered the thrall and were immediately entrenched in party. The faint smell of casual narcotics drifted through the air and red plastic cups covered every available surface. A couple of kids I recognized from lunch but didn’t really know were playing the Wii in the living room and there was intense, but good-natured shouting coming up from the basement. The kitchen was through the living room and dining room and that was where Chase led me, never letting go of my hand, never letting go of me. 
We weaved through sweaty, drunken bodies and came up for air in a relatively empty kitchen. Phoenix turned around from the counter looking surprisingly sober although he was currently holding a bottle of cheap vodka in one hand and a two liter of Sierra Mist Cranberry Splash in the other. 
“Ivy!” Phoenix bellowed. “You made it!” 
“Hey, Phoenix,” I called over the loud music pumping from an iDock on the counter. 
He tilted his head to Chase and then wiggled both beverages at me with lanky arms looking all elbows and knees. I shook my head, “No thank you.”
“Chase?”
Chase shook his head to decline and then brushed his hand across the dark gray Formica countertop testing it to see if it was sticky or not. When he was satisfied that it wasn’t he leaned against it and pulled me next to him. I rested with my hip gently next to his, he was taller than me so mine fell a little below his, but the pressure of his body against mine helped ease the tension I felt creeping into my neck. His hand left mine to snake around my waist and I worked to keep a smile off my face when his hands splayed strong and confident against the thin silk of my top. Chase felt natural, easy. He was thoughtful and careful. I liked that. I liked that so much. But there wasn’t much between us other than physical attraction and a little bit of easy banter. 
If things were different I could get to know him, take things slow and actually let myself fall for him. 
But things weren’t different and I could never let myself go down that path again. 
Not ever again.
“Not drinking tonight, Phoenix?” I asked. He had made a drink mixing the two liquids in his hand but then passed it off to the first girl who walked through the kitchen on her way to the backyard. She thanked him with a slight slur and droopy eyelids. She was for sure going to be puking that same drink up in no time.
	“No thanks,” Phoenix grunted. “My parents condone the parties, but they don’t have to clean them up. I need to stay sober so I can make sure nobody gets sick on the furniture or carpet. Plus there’s the hookups that have to be broken up, the breakables that need saving and the noise level that has to remain neighborhood friendly.”
	“Really? You always stay sober at your own parties? It’s like you’re babysitting everyone. That doesn’t seem fair,” I sympathized with the host.
	Chase gave a soft laugh, “Phoenix always stays sober, it doesn’t matter whose party we’re at.”
	Phoenix winked at me before grabbing another plastic cup. He walked over to the freezer to fill it with ice and then with soda and soda alone. “Some of us like to have fun the old fashioned way,” he explained. “And I’m not the only one.”
	“You too?” I asked Chase, craning my neck so I could look him in the eyes.
	He just shrugged in response; I felt the movement of his shoulder against my back. His hand around my waist gripped my hip and pulled me closer to him. His body felt warm against me, his hand sturdy, holding me possessively to him. 
	“Well, don’t I just feel like the worst kind of heathen,” I grumbled. “If you guys don’t like to drink, then why have these parties?” I asked, completely dumfounded.
	More shrugging. Was it too much to ask for complete sentences?
	“Is it a popularity thing?” I pressed. 
	“It’s more like, everyone knows my parents are super relaxed about this kind of thing so they all expect me to have them. If I don’t announce a party, one inevitably happens anyway just because people start to show up and then they call their friends and more people show up. If I invite people over, I have more say over when they happen. Plus, I usually wait for my parents to be out of town so that if the cops ever show up at least they won’t be charged for allowing minors to drink and smoke. Also, I need to arrange for my sisters and brother to go somewhere for the night.”
	I gaped at Phoenix. “How very responsible of you, but it seems like a lot of work when you don’t even want this trouble to begin with.”
	“That’s not true,” Phoenix defended and gestured around the house with two outstretched arms. “I like having people over. I like having parties. I just don’t like to lose control.”
	I stood quiet long enough for our silence to be interrupted by violent retching coming from just outside the back door. I shot Phoenix a doubtful look but he just grinned in response.
	“Okay, maybe I don’t like the cleanup part, but at least that was outside. My mom has enough flowers, they destroy my allergies anyway,” Phoenix’s eyes were glinting with mischief and I couldn’t tell if he was being serious or not.
	“Really?” I asked unable to keep the skepticism out of my tone.
	“His Zen is genetic. You should meet his parents. You could rob them at gunpoint and they would still ask you to dinner and make sure you got everything valuable in the house,” Chase explained and I wondered if that was true. 
	“Which wouldn’t be much,” Phoenix laughed.
	“The weed has to be expensive,” I countered and then wondered if that was appropriate.
	Phoenix just grinned wider, turning his happy face into a cartoon. “True. Very true. They could always take the drugs.”
	“But then again you just give them away at your parties, so why bother with the gun?” Chase spoke up.
	“Better to get them out of my house then have my little sisters find them,” Phoenix’s expression finally turned grim and I realized that maybe these parties were part of protecting his family. 
	If that was the case then I could understand his motives.
	I had my own little sister to protect.
	“Well, well, well if it isn’t our boy Fred,” Phoenix’s smile came back in full force and he reached out a hand to do the boy-hand-shake thing with Ryder. 
	“Fred?” I asked before I could stop myself. 
	Ryder turned his eyes on me and held my gaze for a long moment before answering. I felt like he was drinking me in, absorbing me into his reality. I shivered against Chase, not sure how I felt about the raw intensity Ryder always looked at me with. It was unnerving and made me feel vulnerable and exposed. I decided that I absolutely hated it.
	At the same time, I loved it.
	“Sure, Fred,” he responded, his voice low and a bit gruff. “And Shaggy,” he nodded at Phoenix. “And Scooby.” 
	I felt Chase’s chest vibrate with laughter behind me. 
	“Shaggy makes sense,” I snapped my head toward Phoenix. “You look exactly like a Shaggy.”
	“Groovy.”
	“But you smell way too good to be a dog, sorry,” I looked up at Chase. His eyes twinkled down at me, his expression soft and sweet. “So that makes you, Daphne?” I asked Kenna when she trailed into the kitchen, two of her friends on either side. 
	“Yep!” She grinned at me and then threw her arms around Ryder’s waist. “We’re auditioning for a Velma. Ivy, you in?”
	“I’ll think about it,” I said pensively. “I look like a lumpy pumpkin in orange, but it could open all kinds of doors for me as a private eye. So, yeah… maybe.” 
	“You do understand becoming Velma means you have to have friends?” Ryder warned with a note too close to serious for me. 
	“I have friends,” I grumbled. I leaned back into Chase, inhaling his warm comfort.
	“Boyfriends,” one of Kenna’s friends snorted.
	“Boyfriend,” Chase corrected and then looked down at me to make sure it was okay to say that. I waggled my eyebrows at him flirtatiously, but felt my heart turn five shades darker with the knowledge he wouldn’t be for long. 
	Kenna cleared her throat and tried to cover for her rude friends. “Ivy, do you know Blair and Reagan?”
	“Nice to meet you both.” I tried to be charming and friendly and…. nonthreatening, but there was no way a friendship with any of these girls stood a chance.
	“Whatever,” Reagan, a girl with rich chocolate shoulder length layers and a spattering of freckles underneath artsy, green glasses sighed. She didn’t even seem like the snotty type. She totally came off as the nose-in-a-book-wouldn’t-hurt-a-fly type. It was me. I brought out the worst in all of humanity. “Ready, Ken?” 
	“Where are you ladies off to?” Ryder asked looking Kenna directly in the eye. A weird kind of tension filled the room and it made me wonder if the happy couple had been fighting earlier. 
	“The backyard,” Kenna replied sweetly, kissing Ryder’s jaw line.
	“Are you kidding me?” Ryder did not even try to conceal his irritation and I had to assume the backyard was generally the worst of the partying.
	“Relax, Ryder,” Kenna whispered sharply. “Blair just wants to find Hayden and then I’ll come back in.” 
	“Whatever, Ken,” Ryder wiggled out of Kenna’s arms. Kenna’s pretty face scrunched irritably and she turned her back on him in a gesture of dismissal. Ryder turned away from her too, but straight to me. The tension in the air grew thick and ugly and settled a heavy silence over us until Ryder broke it. “Ready?” he asked, his gaze holding mine fiercely. 
	“F-for what?” I was afraid of the answer, his eyes had melted into gunmetal pools of intensity and I didn’t want to be caught in the crossfire of whatever was going on with him and Kenna. I hated that he put me between them, like he was using me to get back at his girlfriend. At the same time, this was the first time I had been used against another female. I mean, guys had left girls for me, sure, but never with the intention of going back to the relationship. And even now I knew Ryder had no intention of leaving Kenna for me. This was innocent. 
	Well as innocent as trifling manipulation went. 
I was used to way worse behavior than this.
	“Austin Powers? Remember? We have to make sure your sins against humanity are absolved?” The teasing tone was back in his voice but he was studiously ignoring Kenna and her friends like they weren’t even there. Kenna rolled her eyes and pushed her friend Reagan through the kitchen and to the back door. Her silky black hair floated in waves around her slender shoulders. She was somehow prettier when she was mad, her green eyes alive with a fire that was usually dimmed and subtle.
	“Uh, sure,” I answered inarticulately. “Ryder thinks my life isn’t complete until I watch this dumb movie,” I explained to Chase who was watching me with mild amusement. “Up for it?”
	“First of all, Ryder’s right. You need to watch this movie, it’s absolutely essential to your present and future happiness. And I am up for it, but first I need to find Nick Barrett and rip him a new asshole.” Chase kind of mumbled his last sentence while staring out the window over the kitchen sink. Something had apparently caught his attention because he was letting me go and almost sprinting out the back door before I could ask him any questions.
	I gave a curious glance to Phoenix but his attention was on the backyard too. “That little shit,” he mumbled and flew off after Chase.
	“What in the world?” I turned to Ryder.
	“Nick Barrett’s the only good keeper we have and he’s missed the last three indoor games. Chase is one of the captains and it looks like he’s about to find out why.” Ryder explained. He hardly glanced in the backyard. I would have loved to turn around to find out what was going on, but Ryder had hypnotized me with one of his paralyzing looks again and I was helpless against his power.
	“Soccer stuff?” I clarified since I kind of felt like Ryder was speaking a foreign language.
	“Yep. Let’s go,” Ryder commanded and then turned his back on me. “They’ll come up and find us when they’re done.”
	“Up?” Somehow Ryder had reduced me to one word replies. I was turning into a caveman. 
	“To Phoenix’s room.”
	And then he was gone, through the kitchen, the dining room and to the staircase in the living room that led to the bedrooms. I gulped loudly but no one was left to hear me. Released from Ryder’s hold I glanced in the backyard to take note of the heated argument between Chase, Phoenix and a scruffy Jesus-impersonator with long hair and barely filled in facial hair, who I could only assume was Nick Barrett. 
	“Let’s go, Pierce,” Ryder called from halfway up the stairs.
	I gulped again but obeyed. Shouldn’t someone besides me be concerned that I was going to a quiet bedroom with Ryder alone? I mean, right? I could not be trusted. Not at all. 
	A million different excuses ran around in my head, all vying to be the first one spoken out loud. But instead of doing the right thing, the smart thing, I snapped my mouth closed and followed Ryder up the stairs and said a quick prayer that Chase would follow soon.

Chapter Sixteen

	Phoenix’s room was the last room down of four, just after a bathroom and linen closet and completely overstuffed with furniture. A single bed, two dressers, a tattered love seat, an old school plywood TV stand and box TV set that I wasn’t even sure was in color and then a battered oak desk with swiveling computer chair. The door to the walk in closet hung open, revealing a space a quarter the size of his bedroom, an enormous amount of clothing for a guy, or really anyone, hung haphazardly on plastic hangers and a full and obviously well-used drum set. Posters of bands from the eighties till now were tacked up around the fake wood paneling and the door frame was decorated with ticket stubs I went ahead and assumed were from concerts. 
	I pressed my lips together, trying to hide my equal disgust and intrigue in the space. My first instinct was that the room was filthy. I spun around so I could take it all in and decided it was cluttered but clean. Ryder bent down to fiddle with the DVD player and I walked into the closet to better inspect Phoenix’s drum set.
	I was a musician of sorts. Not like Ryder and Phoenix, not like in a band kind of musician. But my mother had followed the traditions of our circle and I had taken piano and singing lessons since I could walk and talk. Nix firmly believed music was in inherent part of what made us and so I had been classically trained in both.
	I wanted to hate my lessons, hate my skill…. my talent another reminder of what my life dissolved into. I was a showpiece, a trophy wife, a worker bee if gender roles were reversed, sent out into the world to make money and bring it home to our king. I shuddered at the analogy. 
	But I decided a long time ago that I couldn’t hate music. Even though it represented every ancient curse I wanted to run from, it was as much ingrained in my soul as the desire to live was. And it had become an escape. When I played the world disappeared behind me, melted into the recesses of my mind and I existed in a way that I normally didn’t. 
	Music felt like something I could control, my fingers went where I wanted them to, commanded the keys and created something beautiful. When everything else in my life felt out of my control, this was the one thing I owned. And something I needed to keep breathing. I had to be careful that I never used it along with the curse, but that wasn’t a problem for me since I despised the curse more than anything. More than even Nix. 
	“Is this where you guys practice?” I teased when I felt Ryder behind me. I stood just inside the doorway to the closet; the space was big but cramped with the drum set taking up so much room. Ryder’s heat was on my back, his breath floated over the nape of my neck. 
	“Just Phoenix,” Ryder answered softly. 
	I ran my forefinger over the cold, sharp metal of the high hat. I stepped forward a little to separate myself from Ryder and then tapped my fingers on the underside of the cymbals so they made that brassy sound I kind of loved. 
I felt Ryder completely still behind me, as if he were coming to some kind of incredible revelation. He suddenly reached forward and grabbed my forearm, spinning me around to face him. Crippling fear and anxious hope sprung up inside me simultaneously and I lifted my gaze slowly to his, hoping… well, I didn’t know what I was hoping for.
His eyes weren’t on my face though. They were staring down at my upturned wrist. With the hand that held me in place, his thumb moved back and forth across the inside of my wrist, rubbing gently at the skin. His expression was so fiercely intimate, so intensely determined that even though I knew what he was doing, what he was trying to see I couldn’t stop him.
	I needed to stop him, and now. But I couldn’t make myself move away from him, I couldn’t make myself hide the dangerous truth that would ruin everything for me if Nix found out. And out of all the dangerous reasons to snatch my hand out of his grasp, I was also partly stunned. After being so very careful to conceal the hidden word, I couldn’t even fathom how Ryder saw through the thick concealer or how I missed even the smallest piece to cover. 
	Just under the base of my thumb, the black ink had been left exposed. How Ryder knew there would be more, I had no idea. The revealed marking could just have easily been a pen scratch or dirt smudge. Maybe it was the delicate scrawl or the greenish tint that gave the tattoo away, but either way it reinforced the idea that if you wanted to keep a tattoo hidden, the wrist was a really stupid place to put it. 
	The pressure of his thumb increased as he worked to rub away the cover up. Slowly the thick cream distorted and more of the full piece revealed itself. Ryder paused for a moment, transferring my hand to his other while he wiped his thumb against the collar of his black t-shirt. The cover up left a pale smudge where his collarbone was hidden under the fabric of his shirt and a shot of lust pushed through me. His eyes met mine as he transferred my hand back and continued to rub at the tattoo, exposing pieces of it with every swipe of his thumb. 
	His eyes were liquid silver, depthless and raw with perception. He was seeing a part of me no one had seen before, save for the poor tattoo artist I manipulated into marking a minor. Ryder discovered a piece of me that was intended only for me, a piece I never planned on sharing with anyone. 
	Finally, Ryder released me from his stare and his gaze traveled slowly, so slowly, from mine to my wrist. “Blackheart,” he mumbled the word like a curse. Or a caress.  
	The word hung in the charged air between us. The small, fancy script looped around itself and created a pretty effect to the terribly ugly word. 
	“Blackheart,” I concurred quietly.
	“What are you, a pirate?” he tried to joke, but even he couldn’t crack a smile. His voice strained over his words, his expression tight with some knowledgeable instinct that should have terrified me. 
	“Something like that,” I answered without meaning. 
	“What else do you have?” he took a step closer to me. My breathing hitched in my lungs until it stopped completely and I instinctively took a step back until my back was balanced on the corner of the door frame. 
	“Why do you think I have anything else?” I gasped. 
	“You didn’t want anyone to see this,” He reached down without looking and took my wrist back in his strong grasp. His entire hand circled around the bone there and his fingers easily overlapped each other. I felt fragile and small with his hand so possessively on me, covering the hideous word now that it was exposed. “And it means something, even if you’re not going to tell me what it is. Instinct tells me this is not your only secret, Ivy.”
	His words were like pin pricks in my carefully armored skin and I felt myself pull my wrist from his grasp, even reluctantly. I could have used my other, free hand, but the severity of the moment demanded I use this hand, some symbol of confession I didn’t even fully understand myself. 
	I gripped at the hem of my shirt as if it weighed a thousand pounds instead of the delicate silk it actually was. Ryder’s gaze fell immediately to the action and slowly, ever so slowly, arguing with myself the entire time, I pulled my shirt to just below the underwire of my bra. My stomach was completely exposed to Ryder’s full stare, but, even though I was still trying to talk myself out of it, I trusted him. I trusted him to see this. 
	I trusted him to see more of me than anyone ever had, both physically and figuratively. 
	I looked down at my exposed stomach and quickly licked three of my fingers and rubbed at the second tattoo that ran across the ribs on my left side. I had to wet my fingers several more times to remove the concealer completely but eventually the words were revealed.
	Ryder’s own hand came up deliberately as if he were afraid to frighten me, as if I were a wounded animal he was trying to sooth. He brushed his fingers across the identical cursive script almost reverently. His brow furrowed deeply and I wondered what emotion was playing out in his head. Confusion? Pity? Lust?
	Only it wasn’t lust. Not by a long shot. 
	“My soul is free,” he whispered into the silence with the reverence the phrase was meant to hold. “My soul is free.”
	He repeated the words and my heart expanded at the incantation. The words I had chosen so carefully held the deepest meaning of my existence.  I loved the way they sounded out loud, how they fell out of his lips and off his tongue with care. 
	“What do they mean Ivy?” he asked while his hand fell back to my wrist and his thumb rubbed once more along the word that was inked there.
	“Nothing really,” I lied so obviously I was shocked when he simply waited for me to say more without calling me on my bullshit. “They’re just reminders. Things I need to remember.”
	Ryder looked back down at the words on my stomach and wrist and when his eyes met mine the silver had been turned to gray granite, intense with anger and frustration and something that looked like…. concern. “And why do you need to remind yourself that your soul is free?” He bit out the words making them sound like he was dragging them across rough gravel. The reverence fell away and left only hatred for words he didn’t even understand.
	I mashed my lips together, afraid to answer him, afraid the truth would come pouring out of me eager to divulge every last sordid detail of my f-ed up life. The thought was so ridiculous, the action so close to completing itself that I burst out into laughter before I could burst into tears instead.
	“Ryder, seriously, they’re just words. Just little sayings I thought were…. whatever. I don’t really have a cool story or anything. I was drunk one night in Arizona and bored and I convinced this guy to ink me. It’s no big deal. Honestly, I kind of regret it,” I rambled. I took a step away from Ryder and began straightening Phoenix’s hanging shirts and jeans nervously.
	“You were drunk during rehab?” Ryder pressed skeptically. 
	My mouth snapped shut when I realized I said Arizona out loud and that Ryder had correctly associated the time with my “rehab.” 
	“And I don’t believe you regret it,” he accused, reaching for my hand again but I stepped out of his range, putting the drums between us. 
	My shirt fell back down to cover my stomach and a surge of panic zipped through me with my tattoos exposed. My mind spun with all the ways Nix could find out about them. Why was my generation constantly documenting their lives for the world to see? If I was tagged in some candid shot online, my life would be ruined in a strangled heartbeat and the random Facebook friend would have no idea how they sent me to my death. 
	Not that I had that many Facebook friends to brag about….
	But still.
	“You don’t regret it,” Ryder pushed, his expression flashing with determination. “Otherwise you wouldn’t cover them up so carefully. Why do you need to cover a tattoo that your shirt already covers, Ivy?”
	“You wouldn’t understand,” I bit out. I could explain this. Or I could brush it off like it was nothing. Or I could just walk away; remove myself entirely from this situation. Which is what I wanted to do…. but what was exactly not happening.
	“What does the word ‘blackheart’ mean?” he changed his tactic, his voice softly begged with me to open up. He reached out his hand to me, stretching it across the void between us. 
	I melted, I couldn’t help it. Nobody had ever cared enough to interrogate me like this, to get to the bottom of something I could possibly be feeling. “What do you think it means?” I tested a bit desperately. 
	“Because of all the guys?” he guessed accurately.
	“How would you know?” I countered, trying to put him on the defensive, still not ready to make myself so vulnerable. Although, I was fighting a losing battle. If Ryder kept trying, kept putting all of him into these questions like this, like he wanted to know every single intimate detail about me, I was bound to give in. I felt raw from his investigation, completely rubbed down to the bone. Exposed. 
	“People talk, Ivy. Especially about you. All I have to do is listen,” he explained gently. I winced at the compassion in his tone, at the pleading in his eyes for me to trust him. “Is that about Sam? Do you think you have a black heart because of Sam?”
	I physically shuddered at his interrogation. How dare he! How dare he bring up Sam and assume that’s where all my messed up issues came from. Sam was just the frosting on a screwed up, pathetic, life-ending cake. “Don’t talk about Sam. You don’t know anything about him,” I ground out through clenched teeth. I wrapped my arms around my waist tightly, holding myself together, trying to protect everything hurt and broken inside… trying to protect Sam. Or at least his memory.
	“I know he was the one driving that night, Ivy. I know he was the one drinking, not you. I know you can’t blame yourself because he wrapped his car around a light post and sent himself to the hospital,” he paused to let his words settle in. My chin started quivering before I registered that I was on the verge of crying and I looked up desperately at him, silently begging him to stop. “You do not have a black heart because some seventeen year old kid was stupid enough to drive intoxicated and recklessly ruin his life.” 
	There was a full minute of silence between us as I tried to digest those words…. listen to them…. really hear them. But I already knew the truth. Knew it. There was no lying to myself. I had been over this same argument a million and thirteen times before, always trying to convince myself of the same thing.
	“I know all that,” I said so softly Ryder took a step forward to hear me better. “But here I am today. Walking. Going to school. Going to more parties. With Chase. And there will be more boys. After Chase. And after the guy after that. And I get to graduate high school. And live my life. And I won’t look back at him, not ever. Not Sam, not Chase, not the dozen guys before them, or after them. I have to get out of here…. I have to.” I paused for breath, to get something into my lungs, anything to keep from passing out. And then I announced with a tiny gesture toward myself, “Blackheart.”
	“Ivy, that-”
	Whatever Ryder was going to say was cut off abruptly when Chase, Phoenix and Kenna walked into the room noisily. They called out our names and were laughing about something that happened downstairs. 
Ryder held my gaze though, not turning, not even acknowledging them. Quietly, so only I would hear he said, “That’s only true if you believe it, Ivy.”
I nodded like his words had some deep impact on me, but the truth was I did believe it. All of it. Because it was true. His psychobabble was completely lost on me. But I didn’t want to invite any more conversation with Ryder about it, so I turned my expression thoughtfully sad and just nodded. 
Ryder let out a frustrated sigh, apparently my act wasn’t Oscar worthy by a long shot. 
“Ryder-” 
He cut me off, turning his back on me. “I’m not going to tell anyone, Ivy.” 
He was disappointed in me. 
But at least he knew the truth. At least his eyes were completely opened to the vapid, black hole of emotional trauma that I really was. Still the strong wave of his angry disillusionment punched me painfully in the stomach. 
Ugh. Ryder. Why did I care so much?
“I was showing Ivy your drums,” I heard Ryder announce after he left me alone in the closet. 
I stood there battling with myself whether I could leave the closet and face the others or if I would need to pretend sickness so I could get Chase to take me home. I wanted to believe I was brave enough to face everyone, but I wasn’t. I was weak, and selfish and….
“Hey, you okay?” Chase asked from the doorway. His happy, all-American face was pinched with concern. He glanced quickly over his shoulder as if gauging if he should confront Ryder or not. 
“Actually, I’m kind of hiding,” I admitted, realizing my decision as I said it out loud. “I’m sorry, this party is a little more than I can handle.” I looked up at Chase from under my lashes and prayed for undeserved compassion.
“Do you want to go home?” he asked, chivalrous as ever.
“Do you mind taking me?” 
“Not at all,” he offered me a comforting smile. “Maybe you need to talk about it?”
“Maybe,” I relented. “Maybe in the car.”
He smiled down at me and I stepped into him, forcing him into a hug. I knew I wouldn’t talk about this and I knew this was the best I could give him. His comforting arms helped ease the raw pain Ryder had ripped open and I relished in the easiness that came with Chase. I wasn’t getting attached to Chase and that thought made it easier to inhale. I would be able to break up with him, even if the idea felt very similar to giving my favorite pet away. And though it would be difficult, it was doable. And that thought made it easier to exhale. 
See? Blackheart.
I was right all along.

Chapter Seventeen

	Thoughts of the night before attacked my emotions as I sat motionless in the passenger’s seat of my mother’s Escalade. We drove silently on the way to our Sunday visit with my little sister.
	Usually I was dying to see Honor, make sure she was okay, and make sure the curse wasn’t destroying her life… But last night replayed in my head like a destructive addiction. 
	How could I have been so stupid to let Ryder see my tattoo, first of all?
	And then how could I have let his words affect me like that?
	Blackheart. He knew better. Everyone knew better! Even people that didn’t want to see the truth, that preferred ignorance is bliss and all that, knew better. 
	I was a borderline sociopath. 
	There wasn’t an excuse in this world that covered my long list of sins. And that list would only lengthen unless I got the hell out of here. 
	“When we get there,” my mother’s melodic voice cut through the silence, “you need to be on your best behavior. I am not going to put up with any of your antics, Ivy. You owe me.”
	I wanted to ask, for what? Instead I nodded meekly, “I know. I’ll be on my best behavior.”
	“Better than your best behavior,” my mom pressed.
	“Okay, yes. Better than my best.”
	I thought that promise would be enough to pacify her, but she had too much experience in all of this. “I mean it, Ivy. You have no idea what you put me through last spring. You have no idea what you put Nix through! And God, Smith was so concerned about you; it was like you were his daughter. He immediately blamed me, of course. Until I explained about the accident and what happened to that poor Sam Evans.” She said poor Sam Evans, but I would have had to be deaf not to hear the smile in her voice… the excitement. “Still, Smith was so concerned about you, so worried. Honestly, it was a little sickening. I don’t know what happened to him. There was a time when he adored me. He bought me that Tiffany necklace. You know the four karats one? Just because! He bought me that gorgeous piece of art just because and now look at him! I swear it was those cancer drugs. They screwed with his mind. He’s not right. He shouldn’t have Honor. Who knows when he’ll turn on her? Then what? She’s my daughter and I’ll be damned before I let anything happen to her.”
	My mother rambled on and on like that until we pulled through the gated driveway of Smith Porter’s gigantic West Omaha mansion. He was filthy rich, like more money than God loaded. It was what drew my mother to him in the first place, but he somehow clawed his way out of hell and my mother’s greedy fingers. He must have been a monk in a former life, or Mother Theresa or something because to defeat stage four brain cancer and the curse was like legend status. 
	Maybe he was a super hero. 
	Honor certainly thought so, which made me immediately fall in love with him. Any man my mother hated and my sister loved was basically a saint in my book. 
	My mom pulled the car to a stop in front of the pillared front entryway of his huge modern estate and we exited the giant SUV in silence. My mother preferred demure-classy-Ivy over all other options and so I obliged her. She had the power to take away these visits and making sure Honor stayed as far away from our mother as possible had become my life’s purpose.
	Or one of them. Making sure I got far away from our mother was the other.
	“Smile, Ivy,” my mother commanded through her own plastic expression. “Look like you love me.”
	I obeyed and kept smiling as we were welcomed into the house by Smith himself and led to the drawing room. Okay, it wasn’t actually the drawing room, but that’s what it felt like. Smith had a whole household worth of servants but he preferred to answer the door himself when my mom was around. Personally I didn’t think he trusted her around any man, even ones that worked for him.
	Obviously he was smart. 
	“Ava,” Smith greeted her coolly. He didn’t even hold out his hand to her. Where in most of these pretentious circles people greeted each other with kisses or at least a handshake, Smith stayed as far from my mother as he could. It annoyed her to no end. “Ivy, it’s so good to see you back home and healthy,” he smiled down at me, bringing me into a hug. Another thing that would annoy my mother.
	I let it happen. Smith was like the fun uncle I never got to have. He was devilishly handsome in that refined gentleman kind of way, with short, cropped blondish hair infused with streaks of gray although he was still in his early forties. He had a classic jawline and strong nose, and his eyes were deep brown but lightened when he laughed. I could so easily see why my mother had chosen him. And the best part about him was his easy going personality except when it came to everything Ava Pierce. 
	“Ivy!” my little sister squealed from across the room. 
	I wrenched out of Smith’s grasp to open my arms just in time to catch her. She wrapped her stick thin arms around me, squeezing me until I could barely breathe. But I wouldn’t have pulled away for anything. Tears pricked the backs of my eyes as I held her close, inhaling her unconditional love. She was like this mini version of me, with deep auburn hair and bright green eyes and perfect flawless skin. Her freckles spattered the bridge of her nose too, but scattered over her cheeks and one just to the corner of her eye. And she was untouched by our world, completely innocent. 
	I prayed every day that she would stay that way. 
	“I missed you so much,” I confessed into her hair. My voice was full of emotion and I didn’t even try to hide the catch in my throat.
	“I missed you too,” she squeezed me tighter, stepping on her tip toes so she could get a better hold. “Did you get my letters?”
	“Yes, sorry I couldn’t write back. They wouldn’t let me,” I explained hoping she didn’t think I had blown her off.
	“I know, mom told me. She said it was part of the therapy,” Honor whispered but not from fear of being overheard…. from just plain fear. “You’re better now? You’re not… um…. depressed anymore?”
	Ha. The million dollar question.
	“No little one, I’m not,” I lied. I hated lying to Honor, but sometimes it was necessary. I couldn’t have her worrying about me. I couldn’t give my mother something to use and lord over her. If my mom thought she could convince Honor I would be safer and healthier with Honor at home with us, she might just leave her dad to help me. 
	“Alright, Ivy. I would like to see Honor too,” my mother’s voice attacked our embrace and I could feel the rage pouring out of her in waves. She had seen the opportunity too and was furious I gave it away. 
	Honor tightened her arms around me once more and then released me. I watched her walk away and step into my mother’s cold arms and shivered. I glanced up at Smith who was watching Honor with a barely restrained flight instinct. Anyone could see his desire to grab his daughter and get as far away from her biological mother as humanly possible. I wondered if maybe it was the chemo drugs that flipped the switch in his male brain. Is that what happened to Ryder too? Especially after our conversation last night, I was convinced my curse held no power over Ryder. But then why not? Was he sick as a kid or something? Maybe a drug addict in years past, and the drugs had done a number on his brain? 
Except he was way too perceptive for his own good. It definitely wasn’t an intelligence thing.
Grrr. I hated how much he consumed my thoughts, how invasive just thinking about him felt. He was this absolute enigma in my life and I had no idea what to do with him. 
I wasn’t even sure I wanted to do anything with him.
I glanced up at Smith, wondering if there was a way to ask him about his time in the hospital. Maybe he had some insight that would be useful. He turned to face me when he felt my eyes on him and held my gaze. He tilted his head toward the hallway in a gesture asking if I would go with him. I nodded just barely in response, shocked that he was willing to leave Honor alone with my mom. 
“Ava, I’m going to show Ivy a book I’ve been reading about depression. I think it will really help her,” Smith declared in his rich voice that usually commanded board rooms and was right now bending the force of nature that was my mother to his will.
“Why, Smith?” my mother asked coyly. “Are you struggling with depression? I’m sure my lawyer would love to hear the details.”
“Not at all,” Smith replied with a firm hint of irritation lacing every word. “This is for Ivy. It has nothing to do with me.”
“Fine,” my mother sighed as if it was the greatest inconvenience ever. Although her pretend irritation was all a lie, I could see the greed light her dead eyes, her fingers practically shaking with the opportunity to manipulate and brainwash Honor.
I followed Smith out of the room, across his open foyer and down a short hallway. He opened the door to his study and let me pass before looking surreptitiously into the hallway as if on look out. When he was satisfied we weren’t followed, he closed the door quietly and walked over to perch his hip on his massive mahogany desk. 
“We don’t have much time. I don’t trust your mother alone with Honor for more than a few minutes,” Smith explained quietly.
“I feel the same way,” I lowered my voice as if my mother had super hearing or something. 
“First, tell me, are you okay?” Smith’s steely expression met mine. He was truly concerned. For me. 
The realization took my breath away. Nobody was really concerned about me. Everyone, even kids from school, assumed my “rehab” was an excuse to escape the aftermath of Sam’s accident. But now Smith and Ryder in less than twenty-four hours. I felt the ground shift beneath my feet, or maybe it was less physical… maybe it was more like a shifting inside of me, like my soul opened a little bit to the outside world. 
“I’m okay,” I answered truthfully. Both in his question and my answer the subtle hints of what “okay” meant were obvious to both of us. Okay for me was all very relative. I was okay because I was alive and not currently being physically abused. I was okay because I was back home near Honor and able to keep a close eye on my mother. I was okay. But at the same time I was so far from being okay it was sickening. 
“Good,” Smith grunted gruffly. He paused for another moment, stealing a glance at the door. “Ivy, if you ever need anything, I mean anything, money, a place to stay, a plane ticket, anything, you let me know. Alright?”
“Alright,” I nodded my head for extra emphasis. It was nice to know Smith wanted to help; it was even nicer to know Smith understood that I needed help. But, I couldn’t under any circumstance take him up on his offer. And he knew that. It would have terrible consequences for Honor. If my mother ever found out, her lawyers would go straight for his jugular which had thus far been protected by innocence of action. But it was nice to know he cared and that he saw a need. 
“Alright,” he repeated, his voice never lost the refined hard edge that I was sure had been a key factor in all his success. “I called you in here because I’ve been talking with your father’s attorney. When you went away,” his voice broke for a moment and I stood up straighter, ready to bolt from the emotion that poured out of him. This scenario felt so dangerous my arms grew goose bumps and my breathing became erratic. “Listen, I know what your mother’s like. I would never be able to forgive myself if something happened to you. I don’t know details of what your life is like living with her, but I know damned well that my own daughter will never find out. That makes me very concerned for you, understand?” he softened his voice and started talking rapidly so I only nodded. I didn’t want to interrupt him; he needed to get whatever this was out, quick. “Your father set up a trust for you that is available to you once you are eighteen and have graduated high school. The original language made it clear this money is meant for your future, so you can go to whatever college you wish or simply have access to it once he deemed you were an adult. However, there is some language that would suggest the money be made available to you immediately if the court ruled you were in danger.”
His words hung in the air as if the world stopped moving, as if time completely stood still. 
When he could see that I was speechless he continued, “It would be difficult for a court to decide you were in danger unless there was absolute evidence. I’m guessing you don’t have concrete evidence of physical or verbal, even emotional abuse or even threatened physical abuse?” I shook my head in defeat. “Well, I didn’t expect it to be that easy, don’t worry. With your permission I would like to continue talking to your lawyer. I approached him on impulse after I learned you were sent for treatment. But I think he and I might be able to work through this and make your fund available to you before graduation. Would that be alright with you?”
I wanted to agree, I wanted to beg him to do whatever he could. I would even pay for it; he could take whatever he wanted from my inherited millions. I just needed enough to disappear, he could have the rest. But that’s not what came out of my mouth, “I…. I have to say no. Smith, thank you so much for being so concerned about me. But I’m fine. I was sent away for what happened with Sam Evans, not because of anything else. But I’m better now. I’m fine.” Even I heard how flat and lifeless my words sounded.
“Ivy, I have a lot of money. Whatever I work on will be kept completely private, completely secret,” he promised. He was pleading with me, desperate to get me to agree. And I wanted to, I wanted to so bad. 
“Smith, I can’t,” my voice broke and I shot nervous glances at the door every ten seconds. “Don’t worry though,” I was quick to assure him when I watched his face fall. “I have a plan. I swear to you I will be fine.”
“I know you will, kiddo,” he stood up from his desk and put a strong hand on my shoulder. “If you change your mind though, call me first thing.”
“I will,” I lied. I wouldn’t change my mind and if I did the minute I dialed Smith I would remember Honor and hang up. I moved to the door and sprinted out to the hall as if the devil were chasing me. Smith’s offer was way too risky to even consider. 
And walking back into the great room where my mother was cuddled on the couch with Honor whispering all kinds of treacherous secrets into her ear I remembered why. Smith needed to stop playing my savior and focus on his daughter. My mother was a ruthless witch and she would do whatever she could, anyway that she could, to rip his happiness apart and steal everything of value from my little sister. 
In two years, when I graduated high school and finally had the access to the trust I needed, Honor would be thirteen. She would be old enough to understand some of what went on in my world and why she needed to stay away. As long as she believed me, as long as Smith kept his umbrella of protection firmly over her, she would be safe. 
Besides, by then I would have run out of time. At eighteen I could no more protect Honor than I could myself. I would be an adult, fully responsible to the circle, fully in the custody of Nix. 
I allowed myself one long shudder of fear, reminding myself of my goal and why I needed to deny Smith any help he offered. And then I joined my sister on the couch. I would relish this time with her, cherish it and adore her. My freedom had a countdown clock attached to it, but so did my relationship with my sister.
I guessed it was true what they said, you couldn’t have it all.
Or, in my case, any of it.

Chapter Eighteen

	Monday morning was the worst mornings of all. And this particular Monday morning was worse than most. The sky was overcast and cloudy, dripping with freezing rain that reminded everyone winter was close. The trees were almost completely bare, save for the last golden leaf that hung on, desperate not to die. The sidewalks were drenched with puddles and mud. And Central High loomed above me, void of even shadows this morning. 
	The building usually beamed like a beacon of refined beauty. Once the state capital building, it had sharp lines and aristocratic architecture. It stood directly next door to the gleaming white and pink marble of the Joslyn Art Museum and together the buildings were joined in aged beauty. They broke up the cold, heartless skyscrapers of downtown and forced sprawling lawns in an otherwise jungle of concrete and stone. 
	“I suppose I should go inside, huh?” I grumbled inside the warmth of Exie’s car. 
	“Do you want an umbrella?” Exie asked around a sip of her latte.
	“Do you have one?” I turned back around to face her.
	“Uh, no.” She shook her head causing her golden hair to shake out around her shoulders. Her blue eyes contorted into confusion. 
	“Then why did you ask if I wanted one?” I laughed. Exie had this incredible ability to take my mind off my problems and forget myself for a while.
	“It just felt right.”
	“It just felt right?” I repeated and mashed my lips together before I could ask any more questions. This conversation was not headed anywhere logical.
	“Yep,” she grinned at me. “Who’s that with your boy toy?” Suddenly her expression was serious, scheming. 
	I followed her gaze and then worked at trying to swallow. “Uh, that’s Ryder Sutton.”
	“Mmm,” she purred. 
	“Yeah, isn’t he all clichéd bad boy?” I tried to joke, tried to hide the notes of panic that were racing through me, pounding at my heart, tightening the bones that caged my lungs into vice grips of jealousy….
	“Sure,” Exie agreed without paying much attention to me at all. “I’ll walk you in, yeah?”
	Crap.
	Honesty was so not my thing. 
	“Hey, Ex, he uh, it’s not that he’s off limits or anything, but he kind of has a girlfriend,” I explained weakly. 
	“I guess that’s not surprising,” she murmured. “He’s delicious.”
	I laughed, unable to stop myself. “Is he a boy or a candy bar?” 
	“Maybe both?” Exie laughed too and then silence fell between us for two beats. “Ives, if you want him, just say so. You can trust me, you know? Besides, I was mostly just admiring from a distance anyway.”  
	I smiled at my friend because she really was a friend. Somehow I had thought our relationship completely a design of the cosmos without any real attachment, except for a kind of predatory protection for each other since we were going through the same thing. We were more though. There was an actual foundation to our friendship, real love between us. 
	It was the first time in my life I had been loved. Truly, deeply, genuinely loved. Even if it was all in the friendship form, I realized how rare those emotions directed at me were. And I drank them in; I closed my eyes and let them settle over me. 
	“No, it’s not that. He’s just different. He doesn’t seem even a little bit fazed by me. He’s like Smith. He sees through it all,” I explained.
	“How?” Exie gasped and then narrowed her eyes on Ryder as he talked and laughed with Chase and Phoenix at the top of the stairs in front of the school.
	“I have no idea. I’ve wondered if maybe he was sick as a kid, maybe he went through what Smith did. I keep meaning to ask him if he’s ever had cancer but somehow it keeps slipping my mind.”
	“I can’t imagine why,” Exie whispered.
	I relaxed into the seat a little, relieved to be able to talk to somebody about this. “I make him mad all the time. It’s like I was born just to piss him off.” I laughed at the thought, how absurd it was to think he was the only male I could make mad besides Nix. “And he’s constantly making fun of me. And not in the flirty way, like he actually thinks I’m stuck up.” 
	Exie snorted unladylike. “I’ve got to meet this guy. And Sloane too! Sloane would die to see someone make fun of you.”
	“He actually works at Delice. We could go get coffee after school?” I didn’t want to acknowledge the happiness that suddenly ping-ponged around inside of me. How messed up was that? I could have any guy I wanted…. literally. But that thought left me utterly dead inside. The one guy that wanted nothing to do with me however? Yeah, he somehow brought my body to life…. gave me emotions and everything. 
	I was so screwed up. 
	“I am so all over this!” Exie squealed with excitement. “I’ll clear it with Sloane and call you.” 
	I jumped out of Exie’s car and into the dreary day, but the weather no longer dampened my mood. I waved goodbye to my friend and headed up to meet with my…. other friends. Weird. They were surprisingly happy to see me. Even Kenna. Well…. kind of Kenna.
	I fell into the school routine easily. I hadn’t been in school for six months, but somehow the constant schedule, the forty-two minute class periods, the bells and hall passes felt easily natural. And I felt thankful for that. 
	I liked to learn, I liked to study. I even liked to take tests. College would have been exactly where I wanted to go next, but there was no way that was in the cards for me. It was escape or enter the trade. Or worse, take Nix seriously and join his household.
	I was wrapped up in those thoughts as I took a pass in English and headed toward the bathroom. I loved school, but that didn’t mean Mrs. Wade didn’t grow excruciatingly monotonous. 
	“Ivy Pierce,” a nasally valley-girl voice called as Amber walked out of a stall to my left. 
	“Hi Amber,” I said softly. I recognized the ugly bitterness she was throwing off her in waves. 
	“It’s because you’re easy,” she said matter of fact, while washing her hands.
	“Excuse me?” I asked in a pathetically quiet, meek voice. The thing about high school girls was they could be the best friends you ever had with the fiercest sense of loyalty or your worst enemy with the flick of a switch. We were emotional creatures, I understood that. But every girl was hard-wired with animosity against me already, born leery of me, waiting for me to betray them. Maybe I already crossed a line with Amber and didn’t remember it, or maybe it was one of those crush things there was no way I could have known about… and it probably wouldn’t have mattered anyway if she had a crush or not. Or maybe she just recognized the enemy inside me that I was to her. It didn’t really matter though, because obviously Amber had it out for me.
	Exie would have told her to mind her own business. Sloane would have figured out just what buttons to push and dated whoever meant the most to her.
	Although, apparently I was already doing that.
	I cowered in fear. 
	The truth was, girls scared me. 
	“You’re easy,” she repeated slowly as if to a child. “Their fixation. Why guys won’t leave you alone. It’s not like you’re all that pretty. It’s just that you’re easy and boys have short attention spans.”
	I thought about Sam and his attention span, how it had ultimately led to the car accident. I thought about Chase and how he didn’t push me to spend time with him or be something I wasn’t. I thought about Ryder and how devoted he was to Kenna. Some boys were interested in one thing; I had known enough of that kind to not be completely naïve. But I also knew some of the other kind now and so with deafening clarity I saved my self-esteem.
	It also helped that because of the curse I knew I was pretty. So she could suck on that one. 
	“I’m not easy,” I replied stubbornly. Because I wasn’t.
	In return she cackled at me. Honestly, she cackled. 
	“Please, everyone knows what a skank you are,” she rolled her eyes in the mirror at me and headed for the hand dryer. 
	“They’re wrong. I’m not a skank.” This was the most I had ever stuck up for myself since being sent away and I didn’t even really know why I was trying. She was welcome to believe whatever she wanted about me. In fact, Nix preferred the rumors even if we were ordered to hold on to our virginity until he could line up a worthy buyer. 
	“That’s not what Sam Evans told everyone the night of that party,” she countered bravely.
	That was enough to snap any calm resolve that remained. “You need to stop with that,” I snapped. “You don’t know anything about Sam, so stop using him to make up your points. Sam loved me. Loved me.” Well, not me. Sam fell in love with the curse, but Amber didn’t need to know that. “So stop putting words in his mouth when it’s so unfair that he can’t defend himself.”
	“And look where that got him? Paralyzed and brain dead. Nobody could love you now, not after what you did to him. Now you’re nothing but a used up hag,” she turned on me with biting cruelty, her eyes burning orbs of hatred. “You’re the reason he’s not here to defend himself!” 
	And she had cut right to the most vulnerable vein.
	My breath stuttered in my lungs as I tried to suck in enough oxygen to remain level headed. Hot tears pricked at the backs of my eyes and I wanted to curl up into myself and die, or at least weep. I repeated to myself that she didn’t matter, that she didn’t matter to me. I was stronger than this. 
	But I wasn’t. And all of the broken, shattered pieces of me came crashing down in a suffocating deluge of weakness. 
	The bathroom door opened and laughing girls walked in completely unaware of the impending mental breakdown I was just seconds away from. I couldn’t even look up to see who the happy girls were, my eyes focused on the dirty drain and broken porcelain sink I needed to hold me up. My knuckles turned as white as the sink basin as I held on for my life. 
	“Ivy, what’s wrong?”
	Kenna.
	She was exactly the last person I wanted to witness this tragic side of me.
	“Amber, why does she look like she’s about to burst into tears?” Kenna demanded of my attacker. A soft hand rested on my shoulder as if to comfort me and surprisingly it did. I lifted my eyes to meet Amber’s ashamed gaze in the mirror. She quickly fixed her expression to innocence and shrugged one shoulder casually.
	“What did you say to her?” Kenna ground out and then thought better of rehashing Amber’s accusations. “You know what? Never mind. You’re a bitch. You’ve always been one and that isn’t going to change. It drives you crazy Chase is happy with Ivy, but jealousy is an ugly color on you. Just leave her alone, Amber. She doesn’t need your drama and neither do I.” 
	Amber struggled to swallow against Kenna’s tirade. I watched her throat work to finish the action, while her eyes glossed over with tears. She silently turned around, tugged at her shirt to make sure it was in place and then left the bathroom. I didn’t have any trouble believing Kenna’s words had hit home.
	I realized slowly how popular Kenna was. It wasn’t that before I left I was oblivious to her social status, but while I had my own agenda, popularity never really mattered to me. Besides Kenna seemed like one of the nicest girls ever, in the history of girls. She tried to befriend me for God sakes. Or at least she put up with me.
	And now she was sticking up for me. The whole scenario felt surreal.
	Nobody should be sticking up for me. I was the lowest of the low, the worst of the worst. I had one agenda and one only and it was completely selfish. But in the last three days more people had come to my aid than I thought existed in my life. 
	I wasn’t alone. Not by a long shot.
	But now what was I supposed to do with that realization? Besides my girls, I couldn’t take anybody with me and there was nothing on earth that could persuade me to stay. 
	“Thanks,” I mumbled to Kenna who waved me off like it was no big deal. 
	“Don’t worry. She is a bitch. It’s not like she doesn’t know it. She’s just not used to being told the truth,” Kenna laughed and then turned to primp and preen in the mirror.
	I smiled in response but didn’t offer anything else. Suddenly and very inexplicably I felt bad for Amber. Which sucked since she made me feel like the worst kind of awful…. but still. I didn’t deserve this kind of attention from Kenna and their friendship didn’t deserve me getting in the middle of it. At the end of all this I was gone, out of here. There was nothing long term between any of us, and besides Amber couldn’t even really be blamed. She hated me for good reason. Especially if she had a thing for Chase…
	I sucked in a deep breath and snuck another peek at Kenna.
	I couldn’t identify anything going on between Ryder and me, but either way I knew without a shadow of a doubt that Kenna should not be defending me. She should be defending her relationship. I promised myself at least four times a day that I wanted nothing to do with Ryder, but the guilt seeping into my bloodstream and pumping through my heart with crackling clarity begged to differ. 
	“Are you going back to class?” Kenna asked me while her other two friends waited for her by the door. 
	“In a minute,” I whispered, still trying to put the broken pieces of myself back together.
	“No worries,” she grinned a carefree smile and then met her friends at the door. “See you later, Ivy.”
	“Yep,” I croaked and went back to gripping the sink. I looked up and met my watery green eyes in the mirror. I looked over my silky auburn hair, the reddish gold highlights were really coming out now that my hair had a chance to heal from the poor dye jobs I was obsessed with right before I was sent away. My skin seemed paler than normal but still held that milky-porcelain-perfection all the women in our circle kept. I was beautiful.
	But empty.
	And I didn’t deserve any of this.

Chapter Nineteen
	 
	“Oh lord, I’m so nervous!” Exie squealed as we crossed the street to Delice. 
	I rolled my eyes. “What do you have to be nervous about?” I demanded over the clicking sound of our heels against the wet pavement. The sky hadn’t stopped spitting since it opened up yesterday morning and the constant drizzle made even my hair frizzy and wild. 
	“To meet him of course!” she exclaimed dramatically. “I just hope he’s everything I want him to be! Last night was so anticlimactic that if he’s not there tonight I might die. Seriously, I might just die!”
	Sloane laughed delicately from the other side of Exie and I threw her a “what the hell” look just for good measure. “He had band practice last night, or that’s what Phoenix told me today. So he should definitely be here tonight. But, honestly, I don’t understand why you’re so worked up about this, Ex? It’s not like I’m ever going to date him or anything. I’m just mildly curious about why he seems so…. impenetrable.” 
	“Oh honey,” Exie groaned. “I’m not sure there is a man out there that is…. impenetrable. In fact, I’m pretty sure they are all very aware of how…. penetrating they can be.”
	Sloane snorted this time, not at all delicately. Even I couldn’t stop the smile from appearing on my face. 
	“You sound like my mother!” I laughed. “You’re so gross.”
	“But accurate,” Exie giggled.
	“I just don’t understand the fascination with him,” I paused at the door to Delice, holding my hand firmly on the handle so they couldn’t muscle their way by me. 
	Sloane let out an exasperated sigh and explained, “Let’s start with the fact that you have never once, not once, been even curious about a boy. But you’re so much more than curious, and don’t even try to deny it. You are protecting him like the fiercest kind of guard dog, which is also completely uncharacteristic. We know he’s hot and that you’re attracted to him. And then throw in the fact that he isn’t the least bit enslaved by the curse, I mean, come on, Ivy, it doesn’t take a genius to figure out why you would be so fascinated by him. But don’t take that the wrong way; it’s okay that you’re into him. I promise that it is. Just because the curse has repressed us, doesn’t mean we have to live in bondage to it. You deserve a free life, a free love life.”
	“Plus, he’s hot, Ivy! Look at him!” Exie practically swooned right here on the damp sidewalk. Her eyes glazed over and her lips parted slightly as she took in his extremely messy dark hair and full lips. He looked like he just crawled out of bed after hours of making out or something even more lascivious, and his tough, overly masculine hands were working the cash register with practiced, confident movements. He had a black apron folded in half and tied around his waist that accentuated how narrow his hips were, and he was wearing a gray cardigan over a faded red t-shirt that made him look more college-hottie than high school-bad-boy.
	Sloane sighed again only this time it was in complete adoration for the boy on the other side of the glass. She pushed by me and walked into the coffee shop with an intense presence that demanded she be noticed. She had never looked more like Snow White in my opinion than tonight, with her long, almost black hair tumbling over her shoulders in soft waves, her glossy red lipstick and soft pink blousy mini dress. 
	A pang of jealousy clenched my gut and I hated how frumpy and unkempt I felt next to my two gorgeous friends. Exie followed Sloane and the two of them made their way up to the counter while I watched them like a creeper from through the door. I wanted to drag them back outside and explain to them that I hadn’t meant my fascination with Ryder, I meant theirs.
	They were wrong. There was no fascination on my part. None at all. Only a desire to protect something outside the realm of our world. 
	Sloane had waged a completely unnecessary argument against me.
	I hoped.
	Because even now something was fluttering in my stomach and I refused to name the emotion that drugged my senses and narrowed the entire scope of my vision just to him. He was looking at me through the glass now while my friends made fools of themselves gesturing for me to come inside. 
	The corner of his mouth kicked up into a crooked smile and his face softened into an intimate kind of secret between us. He tilted his chin, silently telling me to join them inside. The movement was so subtle but so commanding my hand was reaching for the door before my brain registered what it was doing.
	I was starting to hate those subtle movements he seemed to command so carelessly but received the most immediate results with. As the warmth from the coffee shop blew into my face and tugged me inside I decided that Ryder must have some kind of mind control power to get everyone to obey those casual movements. Or at least he had one over me.
	It would explain so very much.
	And then there would be nothing to be worried about. 
	Only, there was no such thing as that kind of mind-control power. So whatever was happening between us had to be something even more unexplainable.
	Or at least on my end. With a whoosh of exhaled breath I entered the coffee shop and made my way to the counter.
	“Hey, Ryder,” I threw a smile at him. In a weird play of power I wanted to be the one that spoke first. 
	“Hey, Ivy,” he echoed in only a slightly teasing voice. “Caramel macchiato?”
	“Yes, please,” I dropped my eyes to the counter, hiding a wider smile.
	“Have a seat ladies. I’ll bring these out to you when they’re ready,” Ryder directed with his gravelly voice. 
	“How much is it?” I asked, reaching for my purse.
	“That’s alright, I’m using my employee benefits.”
	“Oooh,” Exie cooed. “Employee benefits! Do all of your friends get these benefits?” 
	Ryder’s small smile turned into a full on grin and he turned his focus to my best friend. I immediately felt the loss. “Sure, and friends of friends.”
	“Sweet!” Exie exclaimed in her screechy girl way.
	“Mmm-mm. I want to pay,” I argued. 
	“Not a chance, Red. Go sit down,” Ryder countered with restrained force. He wasn’t going to be argued with. I wondered if I had offended his pride, but when I looked up and met his stare a shock of some emotion rocked my body leaving me breathless. His steely gray eyes were daring me to defy him. They were filled with cocky arrogance and something more... something like possession, like it was his entitlement in life to pay for my coffee.
	Losing the battle easily to that kind of resolve, I simply nodded and followed my giggling friends to a table. I was used to Nix’s male-dominant tactics; they were like the slow poison sucking away at my life. Nix wanted to control, to force me to serve. I loathed the prideful power that was Nix.
	But Ryder was something so different, so…. gentle. He was pushy and domineering and a complete Neanderthal. But his feelings came from a place of sweetness, and with a desire to protect.
	When Nix ordered me around I felt like a caged animal. 
	When Ryder ordered me around I felt…. turned on.
	Oh no. 
	This was so not good.
	“Ivy, he’s so yummy,” Sloane murmured, her eyes glittering with appreciation for the male species. 
	“Right!” Exie squealed in an exaggerated whisper. “I told you!”
	What was with my friends and look at all guys like they were edible? Possibly we should have ordered some croissants too to curb their obvious hunger…. 
	“But you’re right,” Sloane continued, her tone dropping with disappointment. “He’s so not affected by us at all. It’s kind of eerie actually.” 
	“But kind of nice?” I posed the statement as a question even though for me it was like balm to open wounds. I knew without a question how healing it felt to be around Ryder, to feel how unimpressed with me he was. 
	That was sick, right? There had to be something wrong with me.
	“So are you going to….” Sloane hesitated and I knew what she was getting at but I didn’t even want to hear the question out loud. “I mean, Chase is almost times-up, right?”
	“I’m not, no way.” I growled. “He will never get anywhere near Nix, or my mother. Could you imagine?” My voice dropped to a whisper as if the axis of evil could somehow overhear me.
	Sloane nodded with approval, her worried expression turning back to one of respect. Exie just smiled at me with this enormous grin that ate up half her face. 
	“What?” I asked, narrowing my eyes at her.
	“Nothing,” she said but kept smiling and now her eyes seemed to be holding a secret. 
	“Exie, what?” I demanded.
	“Nothing,” she sighed contentedly. “I’m just… I’m just happy for you.”
	I snorted. “I just told you, I’m not-”
	“I know,” she rushed quickly. “I know you’re not. But can’t I be happy for you anyway?”
	“Whatever,” I laughed and then Sloane joined in. 
	Three coffees were set down in between us and I felt the presence of Ryder’s overwhelming presence looming over me. He pushed the hot cups around the table, sorting out the different orders to their owners and then returned the smiles that Exie and Sloane were drowning him in.
	“Ivy, scoot over. I’m taking my break with you guys,” Ryder commanded and this time I didn’t argue. 
	Well, I didn’t argue until I scooted over. “You’re so demanding,” I accused.
	“What?” Ryder shrugged. “Isn’t that why you’re here tonight? To introduce me to your friends?”
	I choked on a sip of hot macchiato and then set it down hard enough so that it splashed over the sides of the red ceramic cup. “Geez, cocky.” 
	He returned my snide comment with a proud smile and his eyebrows rose as if challenging me to contradict him. “Well, isn’t that why you’re here?”
	“Psht. No,” I denied adamantly. I turned my focus to cleaning up the coffee spill with the thin napkins that sat on the table. “We were just thirsty. Don’t be so full of yourself.”
	“I’m not full of myself,” he argued.
	“Oh really? Then why assume we came here just for you?” I chanced a look at him, hiding half my face with my lifted shoulder. He stared met me straight on, his gunmetal gray eyes lit with amusement.
	“Because you’re friends said that’s why you are here,” he answered as seriously as he could.
	“My friends? What?” I gasped. “I don’t have any friends. At least not anymore.”
	“Ives, we so did not say that’s why we’re here,” Exie shook her head, blonde curls swinging wildly around her shoulders. 
	“Sloane?” I raised my eyebrow at her. She was more of a straight shooter and the moment her shoulders sagged I knew they outed me. Wenches.
	“I think it was more like, we might have said, um, how excited we were to finally meet him is all,” Sloane answered in a small voice.
	“Finally?” I squeaked. 
	“What they said was that they had been waiting a very long time to meet me and couldn’t believe how much better looking I was in person,” Ryder corrected in a smug tone. 
	I shrunk into my seat, praying for an earthquake that would open the ground beneath my feet and swallow me whole. That was possible right? A freak earthquake and quick demise? Ugh. 
	“So how long have they been waiting to meet me, Ives?” Ryder asked in a softer tone, but none the less dangerous.
	“Since yesterday morning,” I winced as the confession came out of my mouth. “Exie saw you yesterday when she dropped me off at school. So, obviously enough time for her to get worked up about meeting you.” I shoved sarcasm into each syllable as I spoke, but it was only a weak attempt to salvage what was left of my pride. 
	“Wow, yesterday morning, huh?” Ryder pressed, addressing me only. “You must have given her a pretty nice impression of me to get Exie so worked up.” 
	I peeked up at him, hating how he was lording this over me, but he was looking at Exie and sharing some kind of secret smile with her. Instead of mortification, jealously bloomed bright and fast inside my chest and soon my cheeks were painted red with the emotion. There was no end to how this boy affected me. 
	“I told her you had a girlfriend,” I snapped before I could stop myself.
	Great now I sounded jealous too.
	Ryder’s smile only grew. “I do have a girlfriend.” He turned his attention back to me and held my gaze this time. “So why are you and your friends here?”
	I took a breath and tried to come up with an appropriate response, er… excuse, but the gray of his eyes had melted to silver and I couldn’t think straight. He tilted forward a little, closing some distance between us and waited for me to speak.
	“For coffee,” I finally whispered after what felt like an eternity of silence. 
	“For coffee,” he echoed in a velvety voice. 
	More silence stretched out between us while we continued to stare each other down. We were bordering on inappropriate by now, but there was something about him that drew me in. He stared at me like an equal, like he could look away if he wanted. Like it was his choice to fall into this tractor beam between us. 
	And that terrified me. And then I felt like the worst person ever.
	“I really like Kenna,” I announced and then sat up straighter. 
	“Good,” Ryder snapped out of his daze and cleared his throat trying to come back to himself. “I like her too.”
	I barely heard him. “I’ve never really had like a girl friend before…” 
	“Hey!” Exie and Sloane interrupted together. 
	So I amended my statement, “At school. I’ve never really had a girl friend at school before. But Kenna has been really, really nice.” 
	Ryder stared at me for another thirty seconds, his expression turning to quizzically annoyed. And then he swung around to look at my two friends who were also giving me the evil eye. “Exie, Sloane, it’s been… fun. But I have to get back to work now. You ladies should come with Ivy Wednesday night. I’m in a band and we play the Slowdown for their smaller house shows. You’ll get a chance to meet Kenna, my girlfriend. You already know Ivy likes her, so I’m sure you both will too. Have a great night.”
	He stood up and stalked around the corner and to the back room, ignoring his coworker as she tried to welcome him back from his break. I shivered against the completely unnecessary words that still hung in the air over us. What was that all about? He had seemed polite to my friends, but there was a hardness to his tone that even I couldn’t ignore. 
	I took a quick breath and met the curious stares of my friends. “I don’t know what that was about,” I admitted before they could start the twenty questions. He was going to be back out here in a second and I didn’t want to get caught in the middle of a discussion about him.
	“Ivy are you still doing that concert thing?” Sloane demanded instead. Her eyes were pained and her mouth set in a grim line. “I thought you quit.”
	“I quit because I was out of state,” I reminded her softly. “I’ve only been back once.”
	“Because you’ve only been here for one Wednesday,” Exie lectured in a snippy voice.
	“It’s not like that,” I said weakly. “I’m not like that.” When they both continued to stare hard at me I mashed my lips together, wetting them quickly and then launched into an explanation. “It’s my only thing. It’s the only thing that’s mine. And they won’t find out, I swear. I couldn’t…. I wouldn’t let them send me back, I swear.”
	They were both oppressively quiet as they took in my explanation. Exie refused to meet my eyes, staring down at the napkin she was shredding apart in her delicate fingers. And Sloane was regarding me with her shrew eyes. She was hot in like the Sexy Secretary way and right now I could feel every ounce of her brain power as she tried to pick me apart. 
	“We’re not worried about them sending you back to Arizona, okay?” She reached out her hand and laid it gently on mine for just a brief moment before retracting it immediately. 
	“I know.” And I did know. If I was still a problem there was only one place I would go. And I was afraid I was already on my way. “I won’t get caught. I promise.”
	“You won’t get caught because we’re coming with you,” Sloane decided with a smile. 
	“We are?” Exie’s face lit up and she was back to her bubbly self again. “Yay! A concert!”

Chapter Twenty

	We stepped into the Slowdown just as the first band took the stage. The lead singer threw out a welcome and they launched into an amateur version of soulful blues. I smiled. This was perfection every single time. And even though I dressed to impress instead of my usual unimpressive emo digs, I felt great to be back here. 
	This place was like home base for me, safe, familiar, and so ear-spitting-loud. The far side of the room, where the main stage and pit were, remained blocked off with a thick curtain. The stage lights that lit the smaller stage were bright and blinding, hitting us as soon as we walked through the door. The bar area was packed but the rest of the floor stayed less filled out and felt a bit empty. I could feel Exie and Sloane assess the concert hall with skeptical eyes and almost laughed at their stiff posture. 
	The music was subpar, and the audience completely teenage grunge meets hipster chic. But that’s what I expected, hoped for. To put it simply, this was so not their scene. It probably shouldn’t have been mine either, except the anonymity of the place held that mysterious freedom I longed for. 
	“This is the place you’re always sneaking off to?” Exie asked in a horrified whisper.
	“Hey, it could be so much worse. Have you ever been to the Sokol Underground?” I shuddered at the thought. While above ground, the Sokol had this old school twenties steampunk vibe to it, the Underground had devolved into something absolutely gross. Decades of spilled beer, sweat, blood and decay had worked the opposite of miracles on the below ground concert hall. 
	“I’ll have to take your word for it,” Sloane drawled. 
	I didn’t get it. This was a relatively new building and completely classy. Granted the clientele was different than we usually hung out with, but it wasn’t like creepsville or anything. I glanced at the bar and noticed Neck Tattoos from last time and took a breath of relief. At least I wouldn’t have to explain my addiction to water.
	“Ivy!” a muffled voice called out from across the room. My eyes zoned in on the voice and saw Phoenix waving wildly at us. He stood above everyone else in the room and surrounded by his fellow band members and Kenna. Ryder wasn’t with them though and I couldn’t stop my eyes from roaming around the small space searching him out.   
	I quickly shook my head and waved back, I didn’t really have any right to try to find him here. He wasn’t mine and I was with somebody else. Okay, I was a cruel witch, but not a cheater. I took another quick breath and then grabbed Exie and Sloane’s arms. “Come on, I’ll introduce you to Scoob and the gang.”
	“What?” Sloane asked. 
	I didn’t repeat myself, just kept dragging them through the thin crowd. They so did not fit in here, with their four inch stilettos and designer outfits. They were gorgeous, and drew every eye. But they were uncomfortable which threw off their curse a bit. Thankfully. Although Sloane would be more than welcome in a place like this tonight.
	“Sloane, Exie, these are Chase’s friends,” I introduced by a general wave of my arm. “Guys, this is Sloane and Exie, um, my friends.” I laughed a little at my solid introduction. Everyone was looking at each other, sizing the respective strangers up and that only built on the levels of awkward stretching between the two groups. 
	Kenna especially had the bitch-look going on. She was the only girl in the group though, so that could be understood. I smiled at her, trying to reassure her that they were as cool as me… which let’s face it, was not all that reassuring. 
	“You made it,” Ryder swooped in from around the corner wearing a huge grin for my friends. Immediately tension started to melt between everyone. “Red, did you introduce everyone?”
	“Yes,” I smiled back at him, happy with the attention he gave me. 
	“No,” Exie cut in, equally happy to see someone she knew. “She said these are Chase’s friends. We don’t even know which one is Chase.”
	I flushed bright pink while Ryder laughed at me. “Okay, let me do a better job then. Exie, Sloane, this is my beautiful girlfriend Kenna. This giant over here is Phoenix, this is Hayden, Hudson and Cole. We’re all in the band together.”
	“Sugar Skulls,” Phoenix piped up giving Exie an extra-long look. 
	“Where’s Chase?” Sloane asked, clearly dismissing all the boys in front of her. The hard-to-get-vibe was her signature and so ingrained in every one of her actions I wasn’t entirely sure she knew she was doing it anymore. 
	“He couldn’t come tonight,” I explained before Ryder could take over for me again. It seemed important that I knew where my boyfriend was in front of this crowd. “He has a big test tomorrow, so he’s at home studying.”
	“Bummer,” Exie pouted.
	“Lame,” Phoenix booed and then shot Exie a look like they had just connected over one word responses.
	“I thought he was in the band?” Sloane’s eyebrows drew down in confusion.
	This brought out hysterical laughter from Ryder and Phoenix.
	Ryder explained, “Chase avoids this place as often as he can. He’s completely tone deaf.”
	“Oh,” Sloane sighed. At the same time I realized Ryder knew more about Chase than me. Which wasn’t that hard to believe, because I had known Chase for all of one week, still it was annoying coming from Ryder. 
	We all fell into an awkward silence after that and it seemed to stretch out into the next three poorly performed songs.
	“So this band is… good,” Sloane commented dryly.
	Phoenix snorted like he was offended. “Do you really think so?” 
	“Why? Do you know them?” Sloane asked carefully.
	“Yeah, they’re a bunch of tools. Totally sold that they’re the next big thing,” Phoenix shook his head with disgust. 
	“So you’re better than them?” Exie asked slowly.
	“Well, I mean…” Phoenix stumbled, clearly not used to being as cocky as his band mates. 
	“We’re better than them,” Hayden jumped in, not at all uncomfortable with being arrogant. He appraised Exie with hungry eyes and I felt the strongest urge to step in front of her and sacrifice my own body to save hers from whatever perverted thoughts were happening in his head. 
	“I guess we’ll be the judge of that,” Exie sighed. 
	I burst into laughter, knowing she was just kidding, but nobody else seemed to get the joke. She shot Phoenix a wink and he kind of stumbled backwards, not sure what to do under the pressure of the flirtatious winky-face from Malibu Barbie. 	
	“She was kidding,” I explained to the group when they all just continued to stare at her. 
	“No seriously I was,” Exie agreed. “I know you’re good. Ivy hasn’t stopped talking about how amazing you are all night.”
	“Really?” Ryder asked in true surprise. He stepped back and cleared his throat as if he was as shocked by his question as everyone else was.
	I blushed a deep red and turned around to the bar. I was first of all, not used to blushing so much and second of all, not going to wait around to embarrass myself more. 
	Sloane followed me, showing how uncomfortable she was. “Are you okay?” I asked as we found a place at the bar. 
	“Yes,” she answered in a clipped tone. 
	“What are you ladies drinking tonight?” Good old Neck Tattoos asked with a smirk. 
	“The usual,” I replied casually, careful to keep any tones of flirtation out of my voice. 
	“Alright, water on the rocks,” Neck Tattoos confirmed, clearly disappointed. “And for you?” 
	“I’ll have a vodka-”
	“Uh-uh,” I cut her off before she could continue. “Rehab remember?” I hissed fiercely and pointed at my chest. “I need you to be a good influence on me tonight.” I caught her eye and held it, willing her to make the right decision. We were used to having alcohol thrown at us. Even in public we didn’t have trouble procuring said libations... but these people thought the worst of me already and I didn’t want to add to the rumor mill.
	Which was an anomaly in itself.
	Sloane sighed long and suffering, “Alright. Water on the rocks it is.”
	“Thanks S, you know I love you!” I wrapped my arms around her waist and gave her a squeeze.
	“Sure, Ives. You just hope they’re better than this band.” She said with no enthusiasm whatsoever.
	We walked back over to the band and Kenna. Exie eyed our tumblers of water with greedy eyes and I could immediately tell she assumed incorrectly.
	“Yum!” She reached excitedly for my drink and her eyes lit up expressively. She grabbed it and drank from it before I could warn her discretely. 
	“Oh that’s-” she stopped confused when the taste of cold water touched her tongue. She stared at me, silently demanding an explanation. 
	“Water,” I finished for her. “It’s water.”
	The band on stage finished a song and the room filled with the sudden quiet that came in between sets. They started to tear down their instruments while our group waited for something to happen between Exie and me. 
	“Obviously, it’s water,” She laughed, covering for her misguided expectations. “I mean, you did just get out of rehab. What else would it be?”
	I winced. This was so awkward.
	Thankfully Ryder corralled his band together and they went off to make music. Kenna stared at me like I betrayed her after they were gone so I sucked it up and tried to play nice. 
	“Is he going to dedicate another song to you?” I asked, hoping a little flattery would go a long way. 
	“He usually does,” She smiled at me tightly. “So you girls don’t go to Central, right?”
	“Nope,” Sloane mimicked her uncomfortable smile. “Brownell Talbot.”
	“We have to wear uniforms,” Exie rolled her eyes. “They’re so awful.”
	“I can imagine,” Kenna laughed carefully. “We don’t have to wear uniforms, but our school doesn’t have air conditioning. It smells like a gym locker half the year.” 
	“That it does,” I agreed with a tiny shudder. I missed the warm months this year thanks to my extended vacay in therapy, but spring would be terrible. 
	“So how do you guys know each other, then?” Kenna moved in so that we formed a tight little circle. It was almost comfortable.
	“Our moms all know each other,” I explained before they had a chance to jump in. 
	“Cool,” Kenna commented but then the music started with a strong guitar rift from Ryder and all conversation got lost to the music. 
	The band was incredible as usual- and most of all Ryder. Not that I was really surprised, and even though I had just seen them perform a week ago, his stage-presence was still mesmerizing. I forced myself not to be completely lost to his lyrics, or him. 
	I couldn’t help it though and looking around at the captivated audience I could tell I wasn’t the only one. Ryder sang with intense heart and raw honesty. His eyes squinched shut while his hands worked his guitar with absolute practiced skill. One hand kept getting yanked through his hair in a kind of nervous gesture that made it stick up outrageously in the sexiest display of terrible hair I had ever seen.
	He was perfection as a musician. Everything the audience could hope for. And when the set decrescendo-ed into an acoustic number with only him and his guitar we all sat with bated breath and transfixed eyes. 
	“This is a song I wrote recently,” he started, his voice echoing in the mic while he looked down to adjust his guitar. “The band hasn’t had a chance to play it together yet, so it will be just me. But it’s uh, about chocolate croissants and coffee.” He laughed at himself, the sound gruff and warm in the microphone and the audience laughed right along with him. I swallowed back a strong wave of panic and forced myself to look casual. 
	“Is that something special between you two?” I asked Kenna, hoping I was wrong.
	“I guess,” she shrugged. “I get one every time I visit him at his work.”
	“Oh, that’s cute.” A wave of relief washed over me, I almost stumbled back from the force of it.
	But then Ryder started singing about a black-hearted girl that never let anyone get close.
	Damn him.

Chapter Twenty-One

	Sugar Skulls finished up their set on just the right note. The small crowd went wild with whistling and clapping and Kenna beamed with happy pride next to me. Her boyfriend and his band played an incredible set. She was practically glowing with the raw sentiment Ryder sang with, and still blissing from the solo song she assumed was about her. I thought the song was actually kind of insulting and if I were her and thought the song was about me, I would have been pissed.
Actually, I knew the song was about me. And I was pissed. I couldn’t move on from Ryder’s solo number, the words were like razors on my skin with how exposing they felt and the emotion he sang with haunted me. The way his voice sounded husky and pained against the lyrics to his song, how his eyes shut tighter every time he sang the word inscribed on my wrist and then when his song was over how they refused to meet mine, how they looked everywhere but at me. 
	I had to be wrong about him. There was no way he could write a song about me and not be affected by the curse. And the song was obviously about me. Granted it wasn’t like he sang a love song… it was almost the anti-love song. His rough lyrics about a girl that hated boys and herself more, her black heart infecting everyone she touched, how even though he wanted nothing more than to get away from her, he still found himself pulled to the place her black heart bled. 
	Yep, sounded pretty accurate to me. 
	Slowly the band started to pack up their instruments. The music venue was officially closing down for the night, and so house music came on over the speakers. The smaller-than-normal crowd was subdued after such an emotional performance by the band and left in a kind of ripped-apart stupor. Thanks to the emotional response Ryder demanded, everyone’s souls were shredded by the set tonight, not just mine. 
	“I’ve never seen them play like that before,” Kenna observed excitedly after we stood around quietly for a few minutes. 
	“Sorry, that’s my fault,” Sloane mumbled and I could tell just by looking at her how bad she felt.
	Exie and I knew she would influence the room before we came tonight, but none of us expected this kind of reaction.
	“What was that?” Kenna asked, not hearing her at all.
	“I said, Ivy was right, they are really good,” Sloane brightened her expression and gave Kenna a winning smile. 
	“It’s Ryder, he’s so talented,” Kenna bragged. And she had every right to. Even without Sloane to add to his talent, he possessed something incredible every time he stood on stage.
	“And so is Phoenix, oh my gosh, he’s like the most talented ever!” I squealed. He walked up behind Kenna and I shot him a huge grin. 
	“What is this?” He smiled back. “Are these my groupies?”
	“So, can I get your autograph?” I gave him my best valley-girl impression and stuck out my hip.
	“Depends,” he answered slyly. “Are your friends looking for some too?” He waggled his eyebrows at me so I knew, even though we were joking, he was interested.
	As if I didn’t know before that he was interested.
	As if it was some foreign concept that a male would be interested in one of my female friends. 
	“Exie is,” I smirked, throwing her to the wolves. 
 	She looked over at us having missed the entire exchange. 
	“Exie…” Phoenix smirked. “Sexy Exie?”
	That got her attention... 
	“Oh my gosh, Sexy Exie? That is so clever. How did you ever come up with something so original? I’ve never heard that in my life. Please say it again. Go on, say it again,” she demanded flatly.
	I bit back a smile because Phoenix looked so overwhelmed. It wasn’t his fault guys had been using that nickname for Exie for as long as she could remember. 
	“Say it again. Come on. Say it,” Exie taunted Phoenix further. The poor guy was cowering. This huge, gangly man-child was honestly cowering.
“Uh… Sexy-”
“Don’t! It’s a trap!” I shrieked, not even willing to put up with her wrath tonight. I shook my head at Phoenix and gave him my scary eyes. “You know better. Do not poke the beast.”
“Girls are confusing,” he said slowly with a shake of his head. 
“Don’t worry, Phoenix, Exie is going to forgive you because you just met her,” I turned my serious eyes to my friend and demanded silently that she give him another shot. He wasn’t like the guys we normally met and he certainly wasn’t trying to impress her just to get in her pants.
She had to see that. He was probably the most innocent high school boy ever. 
	“Fine,” Exie relented. “I’ll forgive you, Phoenix, but no more Sexy Exie jokes, yeah?”
	“Yeah,” he breathed out a sigh of relief but with Exie’s startling blue eyes fully focused intently on him, he never really relaxed. “What about Sexy Rexie jokes? Are those allowed?”
	I cringed, waiting for Exie’s reaction, but she simply shrugged and said, “I don’t get it.”
	“Empire Records? One of the greatest movies from the 90’s? Maybe of all time!” Phoenix’s face widened in surprise as the three of us shook our heads, completely in the dark for most movies made in the 90’s…. let’s be real. “First Ivy hasn’t seen Austin Powers. Now this! It’s like not humanly possible not to have seen these movies.”
	“Nope, sorry,” Exie smiled, turning back into her charming self. “I haven’t seen either of those.”
	“Yikes, Ives, that was a close one,” Sloane mumbled into my ear while Phoenix jumped into the cliff notes version of Empire Records and then started dancing…. “Exie almost went apocalyptic on your new friends. Entertaining, yes. But oh so dangerous.”
	“No kidding,” I grumbled. “You have to help me keep an eye on her. No more outbursts.”
	“What is he doing?” Sloane looked over at Phoenix with open curiosity while he wiggled his hips at the same time he shook his outstretched knee and sang into a pretend microphone. 
	“I have no idea,” I blinked a few times just to make sure this was real.
	“It’s from the movie,” Exie giggled. “Some character named Lucas?”
	Kenna walked over from where the rest of the band was hanging out and smiled at us. “Hey, we’re all headed over to Amsterdam for some late night doner kebobs. You guys want to come?”
	“Yes, curry fries!” Phoenix whispered excitedly while pumping his fist like a goofball. 
	“You’re such a dork,” I laughed, feeling surprisingly light after the concert tonight, even if I was going to have to get to the bottom of Ryder’s solo-song-disaster. Inconspicuously of course. I so did not want Kenna finding out her boyfriend wrote a song about a girl he apparently didn’t even like. 
	“Ives, you promised. You said you would be a groupie and do groupie things. Uh… some groupie things,” Phoenix reminded me, circling his abnormally long finger in my face. “You’re a Sugar Skulls fan for life now; you’re obligated to hang out with us after shows.”
	“Ugh, you’re right,” I pretended to be annoyed. “I do love curry fries though, so maybe it’s worth my eternal devotion.”
	“Oh me too,” Sloane groaned. 
	I shot her a look completely surprised that she actually ate fries. I thought I was the only one that cheated on my diet. Maybe I wasn’t the only freak after all.
	Maybe our mothers would send us all away.
	At least we’d have each other.
	We walked over to join the rest of the band while they gathered the last pieces of their equipment and headed for the exit. My cell phone vibrated in my pocket signaling a new text message and since Exie and Sloane were here with me I knew there was only one other person that would be trying to get ahold of me so late. 
	And it was not Chase.
	I groaned before pulling out my phone to check the message.
	Where are you? Nix is here. Home. Now.
	My mother had this unique way of texting that reminded me of old school telegrams. In my head, after each phrase ending with a period, I would mentally say “stop.” Where are you-stop. Nix is here-stop. The war is over-stop. And so forth and so on. 
	“I’ve got to go,” I announced to no one in particular, but everyone turned around.
	“What? Why?” Exie asked a bit desperately which made me think she actually had a fun time tonight. 
	“I got a text from my mom. She wants me home,” I explained. My friends would understand. If my mom called me home, it was not to spend time with her. 
	“Bummer,” Sloane agreed. “Mom was out tonight and my curfew was forgotten.
	“Hey you guys can still go. Why not? Just drop me off first and then you can meet up with everyone.” I gave my friends my brightest smile and hoped they wouldn’t give up on this night of normalcy just because of me. Plus, they would be able to have a better time if I wasn’t there. 
	“Okay, we could do that. If you’re cool with it,” Sloane asked Exie, not wanting to drag her to something she didn’t want to go to, but I could easily tell they were both kind of dying to go.
	It wasn’t often that we had the chance to hang out like other normal kids. We were either attending social functions in our circle, or on dates. And we hated both activities.
	“I could hang,” Exie replied, hoping to maintain her careless attitude.
	“And I could take you home,” Ryder offered from a little ways away. “I actually have a curfew, unlike everyone else, so I have to head home anyway.” 
He looked at Kenna and shrugged his shoulder casually, like it was no big deal. She narrowed her eyes just the tiniest bit but returned his slightly beseeching look with a casual double-shoulder shrug. I didn’t shrug at all because it was a big freaking deal!
	“Uh, it’s okay, they don’t mind,” I scrambled to get out of this. 
	“Yeah, but it’s way out of their way. This way they don’t have to cross Dodge and then backtrack,” Ryder argued. 
	I blushed beat red. Why did he have to make so much out of this? “Really, they don’t care. Do you girls mind?” I pressed frantically, but when they refused to meet my eye and offer me immediate reassurance I stopped thinking of them as friends and started referring to them as traitors. 
	Traitors of the worst kind.
	“See? It’s no big deal, Red. It’s just a ride,” Ryder said more forcefully. I knew I lost this battle, that I would have to agree, but his commanding tone proved he was just bossing me around again and after that little stunt with the song I really wanted nothing to do with him.
	“Fine,” I gave in to get the attention off me and for no other reason. “Thank you.” 
	“Alright, now that that’s settled,” Hayden broke in with his usual arrogance. “We have to go now or they will be closed and I won’t get my falafel, damn it.” 
	That broke the silent spell that had fallen over our group while Ryder and I argued awkwardly. Everyone turned to leave, falling back into their loud conversations. I let everyone pass by me while I weighed my options and reviewed the bus schedule in my head. 
	Once outside in the chilly late October air I searched the street for any sign of public transportation. Unfortunately, this part of town had fallen eerily quiet. Tucked to the north of the busiest part of downtown, and filled with shops that all closed earlier, even pedestrian traffic didn’t exist. No bus in sight, not even a cab to overcharge me for the ten minute drive. 
	“Bye, Ivy, I’ll call you later?” Sloane waved while walking toward her vintage BMW. 
	“Better let me call you,” I sighed.
	“Oh right. Nix,” she bit her lip thoughtfully while her expression pulled down into sympathy.
	“I’ll be fine,” I forced a smile. 
	“I know,” she said quickly. 
	We both knew these were lies. She very well knew I would not be fine.  
	“Bye, Ex,” I shouted after her. She waved me off, still distracted with conversation and Phoenix. 
	“So, are you ready for this? Because I don’t think you are. I don’t think you are ready for the awesomeness that is the….. Bronco!” Ryder called enthusiastically from behind me. I heard his hands hit against hollow metal in a slow drum roll that echoed in the empty night air. 
	Swallowing against a sudden onslaught of nerves, I turned around and came face to face with the ugliest POS ever created. Or maybe it couldn’t even be considered a creation. Maybe it was something more like leftover volcanic ash, or demon vomit…. granted, a lot of rusted blue and gray demon vomit, but demon vomit nonetheless. This was not happening.
	“You’re joking, right?” He had to be. There was no way this thing could start, let alone safely drive me home. Pathetic didn’t even come close to describing this sorry excuse for a vehicle. Rundown didn’t even fit in the same synonym family. No, this car, SUV… uh, whatever you were supposed to call it was the reason all those global warming activists attacked motor vehicles. The Bronco as he called it, was a dilapidated piece of machinery born from maybe the eighties? What pieces of the car weren’t covered in rust were painted in a shabby gray or pale blue, one of the headlights dangled precariously from its empty socket, both side mirrors hung at unnatural angles and the hood was crumpled and squished like an accordion. I felt my mouth sag open and my eyes widen in shock.  
	“You’re in love aren’t you?” Ryder beamed at me, waggling his eyebrows while brushing a gentle, loving hand across the hood. “She’s my baby.”
	“She is not a baby. She’s like your grandma…. on hospice care,” I commented dryly. “Pull the plug, Ryder. It’s not humane to keep up the life-support at this point.” 
	“Don’t be rude. She’s safe, I promise. She’s just a little rough on the eyes.”
	“She’s deadly on the eyes. I feel like I’m going to turn into a pillar of salt any moment now,” I laughed a little. This was kind of fun. I had never ridden in a junker before. I didn’t even know anybody who owned a junker before this moment. 
	“You’re a comedian tonight,” Ryder drawled, clearly unimpressed with my sense of humor. “Besides, it’s what’s inside that counts.”
	He let his hand trail up the hood as if he was actually apologizing for my cruel words and opened the passenger side door for me. The gesture tore my mind away from the sorry excuse for transportation and to how he leaned against the door, waiting for me to climb in. He was actually being kind of sweet…. even though I just insulted his car. Part of me wanted to panic that he thought we were more than we were, even while part of me swooned at his thoughtful chivalry. But most of me instinctively knew this was just the kind of guy Ryder was. He dressed like a bad boy, even had an attitude and a terrifying car to go with it. Also, there were the arm tattoos. But he wasn’t one. He was good all the way through his spotless soul. Just another reason to keep him way, way out of my life.
	And definitely enough reason to convince him never to write a song about me again.
	“Thank you,” I murmured while I climbed into the surprisingly clean interior. The outside might have been made out of more rust than paint and appeared to be more skeleton than healthy body, but his upholstery wasn’t torn or ripped, there was a newer cd player where an older radio had clearly been ripped out and behind the front bench seat the rest of the interior had been stripped down to make room for transporting band instruments and equipment in a comfortable and efficient bed. 
I waited for Ryder to buckle up and pull out of his on-street parking spot before bombarding him with fury. Gentleman or not, he should never have written a song about me. “No more songs about me, Ryder. What the hell were you thinking?”
“Uh-”
“I’m serious. How dare you! Kenna actually thought that song was about her. And I wasn’t going to be the one tell her differently. But if I were her, I would have found that really insulting since the song was mean. Did you know that? It was mean! Is that really what you think about me?” I demanded wildly.
“Ivy, calm down,” he ordered in his superior-I’m-more-of-an-adult-than-you-are voice. Which of course, was no way to get me to calm down. “Yes, the song was about you, but it wasn’t… All it was… Okay, I was just inspired by your tattoo. That’s all. There’s no hidden message from me to you, if that’s what you’re getting at. I just thought your tattoo was kind of cool and it gave me this great idea. I sat down with my guitar and the hook just came to me, Okay? I thought you would be… flattered.” He stuttered through his apology, keeping his eyes locked on the empty one way streets of downtown. I should have taken this opportunity to cut all ties with him. Not that I would punish him for the song much longer anyway, although I was taking a serious hit to my self-esteem, but because clearly he was too attached to me. And I didn’t need that.
“It’s just, you scared me,” I whispered. The words felt stupid in my mouth even as they fell into the air between us. I couldn’t explain my fears for our friendship and I sure as hell couldn’t explain my feelings. I just hoped he would let it drop.	
“Scared you?” Ryder glanced over at me, his charcoal eyes darkened to black in this light and his eyebrows pulled together in concern. I wanted to be honest with him. I wanted to tell him the truth.
See? Dangerous.
“I like you,” I admitted out loud and then realized what that sounded like. “Shoot. I mean, I like you as a friend. You’re a… friend. And I don’t have many of those. I just don’t want to jeopardize what we have here.”
“Oh you mean the constant bickering and fighting? Me either. I love that,” Ryder half laughed, half winced.
“Yes,” I smiled at him. “I don’t get to do this with anybody else. Nobody else… fights with me.”
They control me. Or they use me. But I wasn’t about to say that either.
“And me writing a song about you is going to change that? You know it wasn’t like a love song or anything, right?” Ryder asked, his gravelly voice deep with concern. 
“Please, I know that. You practically called me an evil bitch on stage to a room full of people. I am perfectly aware of how lacking in love that song was,” I rolled my eyes even though he was watching the road. 
“So what’s the problem?”
Before I could stop myself I opened my mouth and spewed… truth. “I just want to make sure we stay friends. If you haven’t guessed, I have kind of an… f-ed up home life. And… if we were anything more, anything like… together, I would have to give this up. Not that we would be or anything. I mean, not that you’re interested. But as long as we remain just friends, it doesn’t really matter. Friends is fine. But never anything more.”
“Ivy, I only like you as a friend,” he promised with heavy tones of sadness.
“This isn’t reverse psychology, Ryder,” I snapped, angry that he thought this was my plea for attention. “I’m serious. I can be friends with you but nothing more. You might not like me now or even ever, but I just want you to know if there is ever anything between us, I mean, even the smallest spark I am walking away from you immediately. There can’t be anything, ever, or I will never see you again.”
“Okay, yeesh. I got it! It’s not something we need to worry about right now anyway,” he said carefully. He glanced over at me again, but I was too embarrassed to look at him to see what his expression was doing now. Finally, after several long minutes he asked quietly, “What about Chase?”
	I took even longer to answer, digging deep for courage. This would be a lie, but a necessary one. “Things aren’t really working out for Chase and me. He’s a really nice guy and all, but-”
Ryder fell back against his seat like I knocked the wind out of him. His jaw turned to stone and his hands gripped at the steering wheel angrily. When we pulled up to the full block-long circular drive in front of my apartment building Ryder threw the Bronco into park and looked over at me.
His narrowed eyes were calculating and made me shrink under their intensity. He was pissed. So much more than pissed. There was a muscle ticking in his jaw and his intensity radiated off him like heat. 
“You know I’m going to have to tell him,” he finally announced with deadly calm. “He’s my friend. And he likes you Ivy.”
“You don’t understand,” I mumbled weakly. And he never would.
“I guess I don’t,” he grunted. “Want to explain it to me?”
“I can’t,” I practically whimpered.
Never before had I felt this bad. Well, except for Sam, but that wasn’t until the night of the accident, until after our relationship screwed up his entire future. But this had to be worse. This was judgment, cold, hard and final. I didn’t even need to go through the whole “stay away from me” speech. Ryder would have no problems keeping his distance after this conversation. 
“Blackheart?” he mumbled into the awkward silence.
“Blackheart,” I confirmed. He finally got it at least. Well, his song proved that he understood, but now he got it. The truth would settle into whatever left over good thoughts he had about me and ruin them. 
“I wanted to be wrong.” His words were soft and sad in his voice, but dug into my heart like a dagger. 
“But you weren’t,” I mumbled. Unwanted tears started to prick at the backs of my eyes and I willed myself not to show emotion in front of Ryder. He couldn’t get it. He wouldn’t get it, if I was honest with myself. Nobody could. 
A sharp rapping on the window caused us both to jump in our seats. Ryder’s window was being assaulted by angry pounding and I leaned forward so I could see around him, see why somebody was so desperate to get our attention. 
“Shit,” I groaned. “Shit. Shit. Shit.” Not very ladylike, I know.
Ryder rolled down his window to address the angry man standing outside. “Can I help you?”
“Ivy?” Nix demanded, panicked and mad as hell. “What are you doing in this car? Are you okay?”
I bit back a thousand sarcastic remarks. Of course a car like this would startle Nix. He probably thought the driver was some homicidal maniac trying to kidnap me. Or he sensed the difference in Ryder from wherever the hell he was before now and had to come investigate what was up. 
Or maybe he just saw me with another guy and transformed into the possessive psychopath he really was.
Had he been waiting for me? Or was this a coincidence?
“Uh, Nix, this is my friend Ryder. He gave me a ride home tonight,” I explained in my softest, most patient voice ever. I shot Ryder a calming smile and willed him to return it.
“I hope this car is safe, young man,” Nix turned his blindingly handsome face on Ryder and his voice turned cold and authoritative. Nix was just crazy enough to believe Ryder would be his competition and if I didn’t separate them soon, Nix would also be holding a verbal pissing contest. Not really fair for an ancient douche bag to go up against an innocent-vaguely-naïve-high-school-kid… But that was Nix. Nothing stood in the way of what was his. 
“Absolutely,” Ryder answered. “I would never intentionally hurt Ivy, Sir.”
I bit back a groan and then had to sit on my hands to keep from slapping them over my eyes. I could not watch this. This was going to end badly.
First the song and now this? I was not sure the night could get worse. 
“Well, since you’re her friend, why don’t you join us upstairs for a while? Ivy’s mother and I would love to get to know one of her school friends better. Especially one she trusts to drive her home.”
Ryder sent me an encouraging smile, probably hoping he was doing me a favor. Holy hell, he probably thought Nix was dating my mom, or some father-figure in my life. 
I was wrong. So wrong. This night could definitely end worse.
And why was Ryder suddenly being nice to me? I so wished he would have just told me to piss off and then left me on the sidewalk.  
“Sure, I have a few minutes before curfew,” Ryder answered with a friendly-love-me smile, totally the polite gentleman.
Oh, no! He was actually going to try to win Nix over.
Cheese and rice, this was going to be a disaster.

Chapter Twenty-Two

	The elevator ride to the apartment was silent and awkward. I felt Ryder trying to catch my eye while Nix stared straight ahead, his jaw tight with agitation. I simply watched my shoes, unable to bare Nix’s frustration or Ryder’s curiosity. 
	“This way,” Nix instructed once the elevator doors opened.
	We followed dutifully behind. Ryder cleared his throat, still trying to get my attention. 
	“This is a really nice building, Ivy,” he announced, no longer trying to be discreet. Not that he would see a reason to be anything but normal.
	“Thanks,” I mumbled. My body was rigid with anxiety, my stomach flipped riotously as I waited for the blade to drop on this guillotine. 
	“My dad and I live in a loft downtown, but it’s an older building so it’s not nearly as nice,” Ryder went on. 
	Nix opened the door to the apartment and held it for us. “Is it one of those with all the exposed brick?” 
	Ryder sounded more confident when he answered, “Yes, it is. My dad loves the architecture downtown.”
	“I do too,” Nix replied sounding deceptively friendly. “I recently rented one off thirteenth.”
	“Ours is closer to tenth, but we looked at ones over there,” Ryder explained. I met his eyes then and he sent the question of who Nix was through his stare.
	“Ava,” Nix called out when the door closed behind us. “Ivy brought a friend.”
	My mother appeared in the foyer with a plastic smile on her face. Her eyes darted to Nix when she realized my friend was a boy. I looked back to the ground completely ashamed of the situation for everyone. 
	“I’m Ava, Ivy’s mother,” my mom introduced herself to Ryder casually. “You are?”
	Ryder took in my mother with widened eyes. She was gorgeous as ever, with her auburn hair down and soft around her shoulders, and a tight pencil skirt and silk blouse. She was perfection and Ryder could easily see that. “I’m Ryder Sutton. Ivy and I go to school together.” 
	“How nice,” my mom murmured, narrowing her forest green eyes just a bit. “Why don’t you come in?”
	She turned on her heel and led us all to the delicate dining table. Nix sat down and the rest of us followed suit, except for my mother who disappeared into the kitchen to make drinks. 
	“Ivy is going to have a glass of water,” my mother announced from the other room. “Would you like one, Ryder?” 
	“Yes, please,” Ryder called back. 
	“So what class do you have together?” Nix initiated conversation. He was pushed away from the table with his legs crossed in that masculine way very virile men can pull off. One hand rested on his bent knee, while his other arm draped over the back of my chair. My nerves were strung tight this close to him, but even more so because of Ryder watching me from across the table. It was like he thought he would finally get his answers here. I had just admitted to a bad home life not ten minutes ago and now he had a front row seat to find out why.
	Except he wouldn’t get answers tonight. Just more questions. 
	Probably starting with why he thought I lied to him. 
	“We’re not actually in any classes together,” Ryder answered. 
	When Nix stayed silent, obviously waiting for more, I volunteered some information. I knew it would cost me later, but I would have done anything to break up the tension radiating at my back. “I’m dating one of his really good friends, Chase.”
	“So you’re a senior?” Nix pressed, like he knew all about Chase. A shiver slid over my skin while I wondered exactly what he did know.
	“Yes, he is,” I answered quickly.
	“No, I’m not,” Ryder corrected. My head snapped up to meet his eyes then. I realized I always assumed he was a senior but had never confirmed whether that was true or not. I felt really stupid. “I’m a junior like Ivy.”
	A fire of indecision spread through my veins. I had been assuming he would graduate and leave after this year. I hadn’t realized how much I was looking forward to being away from him and all the confusion he brought with him. At the same time, unexplainable joy followed quickly in its wake. We would be together for another year. And even if our friendship ended after Chase and we never talked again I knew just being in the same school as him would mean something to me.
	“Honestly, we’re only friends through Chase,” I said quickly, hating how callous I sounded. “Ryder was just nice enough to give me a ride after mom texted.”
	Ryder looked at me like I just shot his puppy, so I sent him a pleading look not to say anything differently. His gaze intensified at the same time his mouth pressed into a grim line. This was important. He needed to leave. 
	My mom came back in the room and when Ryder stayed staring at me instead of looking at the perfection that was my mother, I felt Nix tense next to me. Men weren’t supposed to be able to help but look at my mother. 
	“What do your parents do?” My mother asked, feeling the same absence of attention Nix noticed.
	Ryder accepted his glass of water from my mom, and then explained, “My mom passed away when I was a baby actually, but my dad is a professor at UNO.”
	“Oh how sad,” my mom gasped with the appropriate amount of sympathy even though I knew she felt none. “Did Ivy tell you her father also passed away when she was a baby?”
	“She did,” he answered simply. 
	“Really? Ivy isn’t usually so open about her past,” Nix’s tone was clipped and reprimanding and I felt every one of my privileges slipping out of my grasp.
	“It’s just something we have in common,” Ryder replied more politely than ever. My eyes flickered over to him and I could tell he was just barely holding onto his control. Something set him off and I had to wonder if it was me or Nix.
	The iciness of controlled anger settled into the atmosphere around us. I hated having Ryder here, having him face my mother and Nix. This was a place I didn’t want anyone to see, least of all him. And when his expression turned from fury to wild concern I wanted to push him out the door and make him promise to never have anything to do with me again.
	At the same time I wanted him to never leave.
	“Ryder has curfew,” I blurted suddenly. “He should probably go.”
	I stood up before anyone could challenge me and walked straight for the door, hoping Ryder would follow. I pulled frantically on the handle and held it open until he made his stunned appearance around the corner. He was leaving, but it didn’t look like he was happy about it. 
	“I’m going to walk him to the elevator,” I called when he was finally through the doorway. 
	I shut the door behind me and grasped his wrist with a shaking hand. I needed to act normal, act like everything was fine. Even though it wasn’t. I needed him to believe that it was.
	“Hey thanks for the ride,” I tried to smile while I tugged him along to the elevator.
	“No problem,” he answered slowly. “Hey, Ivy, is everything-”
	My apartment door opened and Nix filled out the doorframe. He didn’t say anything, just watched us from the end of the hall. I slammed my finger into the down button as soon as I was in reach and released his wrist before Nix could make anything of it.
	“I’ll see you tomorrow at school,” I said in way of goodbye.
	“Sure, Red,” Ryder answered, finally taking the hint. “I’ll see you tomorrow.” 
	And then he stepped into the elevator and was gone.
	A breath of relief whooshed out of me and I felt like I could finally turn back and face Nix.
	“One boy at a time, Ivy. You know the rules,” Nix scolded before I could even get through the door.
	“He’s not…. I swear, it was just a ride,” I promised. My voice was shaky, my eyes unable to meet his. Which wasn’t fair since it was just a ride on his part. I hated that it felt like more to me.
	The door closed with a bang behind Nix and startled me. I ignored the way my heart hammered in my chest and the goose bumps rose on my arms. I went back to my place at the table and sipped from my water as if nothing happened. 
	“Ivy,” my mother started.
	“Mom, I haven’t even broken up with Chase yet, please don’t start,” I begged. 
	“Is he always like that?” she asked, ignoring my statement.
	“What do you mean?” 
	“Is he always so composed?” she clarified calmly but I watched her eyes dart nervously to Nix. 
	“He’s really shy,” I lied. I wasn’t sure how else to explain his lack of interest. They could never know about his immunity from the curse. Never. Better to play up my mother’s insecurities anyway. “He’s also pretty oblivious. The first time I met him he didn’t see me until he crashed into me.”
	“Crashed?” Nix asked noticing my word choice.
	“With two cups of coffee,” I smiled weakly. Please buy it. Please buy it. Please buy it.
	“That’s not what we’re here to talk about anyway,” my mother’s tone was sharp and to the point. “We want to know what Smith took you into his office for the other day. And before you deny it, I know you went in there. I watched him close the door.”
	I mashed my lips together, sliding them back and forth while biting painfully into them until they felt bruised and swollen. I knew these questions were coming, I just didn’t think she actually saw us go in there. She was way too sneaky. 
	“He had this book on depression he wanted to give to me,” I replied carefully, slowly. I had practiced this answer in my head a hundred times since Sunday. This interrogation was inevitable, but it didn’t make me any less nervous. “But I said no thank you. I didn’t want him to think my condition was worse than it is. He was just worried about me.” 
	Nix sat thoughtfully for a few moments while my explanation digested between us all. His dark eyes narrowed in thought and his sculpted eyebrows pulled together. My mother sat demurely to my left, swirling her martini nervously. She tried desperately to wait for Nix to speak, to respond first, but her own self-doubt couldn’t hold her back.
	“He was worried about you?” she echoed in the same casual tone I used. “Worried that you were still battling with depression? How sweet.”
	“What else did he say, Ivy,” Nix demanded, knowing there was more. 
	“He thought maybe,” I paused. This was dangerous ground. But what else could I do? “He thought maybe mom had something to do with why I was sent away.”
	I cleared my throat while that grenade settled. 
	“Smith,” Nix growled. 
	“Damn that man,” my mother echoed. 
	Like Smith was the villain. She married him to get knocked up, take all his money and then watch him die. And Nix orchestrated the entire plot. 
	“What did you tell him, Ivy?” Nix asked, his eyes flickering up to mine. They were fierce and demanding. They were eyes that would not be lied to.
	“I told him the truth,” I began and forced myself to control the tremble in my voice. “I told him I went away because of Sam.”
	More pause. Nix looked down into the depth of his scotch glass and seemed to simply watch the oversized ice cube melt. My mother’s gaze flitted between me and her employer and I wanted to roll my eyes and demand she grow a backbone. I was her daughter.       
	But she wasn’t afraid of me. 
	Not like she was afraid of Nix. 
	“Did you tell him what happened with you and Sam Evans?” Nix finally asked.
	“No, not specifically,” I answered quickly. 
	“Have you told anyone what happened?” 
	“I, uh, no. Kids at school assume the accident was my fault. But everyone knows it was a drunk driving thing. There’s a…. a, uh, can at school for him,” my voice was a whisper, weak, tremulous and delicate. 
	“A can?” Nix asked in a gruff voice. He was impatient with me. I had failed him. I had failed him in lots of ways, but tonight he was frustrated with my weakness.
	“They take donations for his recovery. He will be wheelchair bound for the rest of his life.” I sucked in a breath, feeling as though my soul was being scraped across broken glass. The empty remains of my heart lay shattered on the floor and I continued to drag my fragile soul back and forth until I was left bleeding and desperate. 
	“Ivy, we’re not still here are we?” Nix suddenly demanded, standing abruptly from his chair. “Sam chose to drive after drinking. Hell, Sam chose to drink as much as he did. You cannot keep blaming yourself for his poor decisions. And when I think about what could have happened to you, how he could have hurt you….” His expression broke for just the briefest second and I saw actual emotion behind his perfect façade of control. My breath stuttered in my lungs at the thought he would actually care what happened to me. “It’s time to get over it. Grow up, Ivy. Be an adult for once and put the blame of this unfortunate situation where it belongs. No more sulking. I mean that, no more.” he finished on a growl and then stalked into the kitchen where he threw his still half-full glass into the sink. The glass shattered against the stainless steel, the sound of splintered shrapnel breaking up the shock he left behind.
	My mother simply stared at me, unsure what to do with Nix’s show of emotion or my still-obvious trauma.
	“Ivy,” Nix’s voice was gravel and rocks when he returned and leaned against the wall. “The boy that was here tonight, he would be a good choice for you next. He will give you a bit of a challenge. You need that. How long have you been with the other one, the one you’re with now?”
	“Not even two weeks,” I mumbled. 
	“Give it two more,” Nix commanded. “And then the other boy.”
	“He has a girlfriend,” I pleaded desperately. “They are in love. I couldn’t…. I’m friends with her too.”
	His eyes darkened with anger until they were black orbs of fury, sucking the light of the room into their depths. “Don’t be ridiculous,” he hissed. “This isn’t a discussion. You know that. I have business in Greece for the next two weeks. When I return, my apartment will be ready. I’ve decided to stay until this group of legacies graduates. You have two weeks to find a way to deal with all of this. I don’t want to see any traces of this when I return. Am I understood?”
	I could only look up at him for a few seconds, hating him with every fiber of my being, with every molecule and atom I was made with. “Yes, I understand,” I finally answered, meeting his stare at the same time my fingers traced along my ribs where a tattoo that meant more to me than anything else in this world was etched. “I’ll be better, Nix.”
	“Ava, don’t disappoint me,” Nix turned his attention to my mother who audibly gasped at his words. “I’m leaving her in your hands. I want her perfect again. Do your job as her mother for once in your life.”
	She nodded pathetically, barely able to meet his intense eyes. 
	“Good,” he finally growled and then pushed off the wall.
	My mother and I sat perfectly still long after the door slammed behind him. Neither of us could meet the other’s eyes or get up to move around. He was everything in both of our lives. We both bent to his will, followed his commands. 
	The difference between us couldn’t be more obvious. My mother resigned herself to this life a long time ago. There was no other existence for her.
	And for me? This was the only existence I refused to live. I would play my part. But Nix would not rule over me forever. 
	I decided to call Smith in that moment. He offered help and I would take it. Things could always get worse than they were now- but not by much. And that was a risk I had to take, because if I waited much longer I wouldn’t be able to leave. I wouldn’t be able to piece back together all of the broken pieces that ceased to make a whole person. There would only be the ghost of me that remained. 
	A ghost, just like my mother.

Chapter Twenty-Three

	“Ivy,” Ryder called before I could even step foot inside the building. 
	Damn it. I hoped my whole plan to arrive late and leave early, avoid even eye contact with him and ignore all people completely would work out in my favor. Apparently, Ryder came prepared this morning, verbal guns blazing and all.
	“What?” I grunted. I knew this was coming. Obviously he would have questions. But it didn’t make me any more excited to deal with them. 
	“You need to talk to me, Ivy.” He leaned against one of front doors waiting to attack me. His arms crossed over his chest pulling his faded blue long sleeved t-shirt tight across his biceps, his jeans hung loose and torn at the knees and thighs. His black combat boots went untied and still damp from the constant fall drizzle outside. And his hair, oh good lord, his untamable hair. His wild, bed-head hair stood up haphazardly in every direction. The dark brown locks going straight up only to fall over at the tips and tell the story of a hand being dragged through them in frustration, or anger, or…. desire. 
	Energy rushed through me at the sound of my name on his lips. I paused in the doorway, without consciously deciding to stop. He had that kind of control over me. He called to me. Intoxicated me. He was becoming so much more to me than I should have ever let him. And yet my eyes were locked to his even while I screamed internally at my legs to move.
	“About what?” I shrugged one shoulder and waited. I was hoping if I could pull of indifference maybe he would chicken out.
	“Who is that guy?” his deep voice demanded, even while I watch his tongue wet his bottom lip and his jaw clench with some kind of raw emotion I couldn’t identify.
	“What guy?” I whispered, forcing my eyes back to his. 
	“Stop it, Red. Just stop.” I winced against his harsh tone and his gray eyes immediately softened. 
	“I can’t,” I shook my head desperately and then glanced down the hallway nervously. 
	“You told me we were friends last night. You. You’re the one who told me we were friends. Let me be your friend,” he pleaded in the softest voice I had heard him use. 
	I tilted my head so that I could inspect my Tory Burch flats and the hot pink skinny jeans that were basically painted on my legs. I could kick myself right now. Keeping Ryder at a distance did not mean declaring a relationship with him even if it was of the platonic variety. And it certainly didn’t mean including him in all the twisted intricacies of my life.
	“Ivy,” he breathed. He took a step forward and very gently slipped his fingers into the hand hanging limply at my side. “I’m not going to do or say anything that will get you into trouble. But I need to know that you’re alright.”
	The warmth of his fingers spread through my body like liquid heat, infecting every inch of me. I felt every small connection of his skin to mine, the pads of his fingers, his joints that bent to curve around my hand, the heel of his hand as it pressed into mine. I closed my eyes against the sensation. The feeling was so profound, so all consuming that it intensified until my fingertips tingled and my toes curled. I closed my eyes and prayed this was all that Ryder was, just a rush of feeling, of sensation, that the only pull I felt to him was the rush. 
	But even I wasn’t that good at lying to myself. 
	“Are you in trouble?” he whispered. 
	“No,” I felt myself answer. “He’s just a friend of my family. He… he’s overprotective of me. That’s all.”
	I made myself look up at him and meet his penetrating gaze. I mashed my lips together and begged him to drop this. 
	“I just want-” he started, but didn’t get to finish.
	“Oh, good you found her!” Phoenix called from down the hall. He was walking toward us from the same classroom I knew Chase was in and I instantly felt guilty. I pulled away from Ryder immediately, breathing easier with the small distance. “So have you asked her yet?”
	Ryder shook his head, his expression pulled into masked pain. He smiled at Phoenix as he approached with a large wooden hall pass swinging in his hand, but his eyes stayed hard granite, pinched in the corners and he raked his hand through his already tousled hair as if he were trying to pull it from its roots. 
	“Ask me what?” I braved, ignoring the way my voice cracked and tremble.
	“Your friends spilled your secret last night, Ives,” Phoenix announced somberly and I felt all the breath leave my chest in a whoosh of panic.
“What do you mean?”
“About the you know,” Phoenix’s brow turned down to concern before he mimicked playing the piano, his fingers wiggled animatedly in the air. “Exie said you could seriously play.” 
	“Oh, the piano? Um, yeah, just a little bit,” I answered. My breathing returned to normal, but this secret was no less dangerous.  
	“They said you were super talented,” Phoenix pressed. 
	“I don’t know about that. I’ve been playing most of my life though,” I answered truthfully. I embraced the distraction from Ryder’s intense focus and line of questioning. 
	“So you’ll play for us then?” Phoenix asked so casually I almost didn’t catch the weight of his words.
	“What do you mean? For Sugar Skulls?” I asked a bit hysterically. 
	“Yeah, we’re looking for a keyboardist,” Phoenix’s eyes lit up with excitement and expectation while Ryder stilled to stone next to me. “We need you, Ives.”
	“No, I don’t think you do,” I backtracked quickly. “I’ve only ever played classical. I wouldn’t even know how to go about playing with you guys. Plus, it will mess up your whole look if you add a girl. It’s cool that you would think of me, but honestly, I would be more work than it’s worth.”
	“Don’t be so modest, Red,” Ryder chided with a challenge. “I’ll help you out, help you get the feel of playing with a band. It will be good for you. Expand your horizons and all that.”
	I cleared my throat nervously. “My mom probably isn’t going to be okay with it.”
	Phoenix’s entire body sagged with disappointment. His eyes pulled into huge, cartoonish versions of sadness and his lower lip slipped out into the most pathetic pout. “Aw, Ivy, we need you. Come on, don’t you want to help out your friends?”
	“It’s not that. I mean, I would if I could. But you guys probably have lots of practices, plus the gigs and I don’t think I can commit to all of that right now. Don’t forget, I’ve never even played in a band before. I’ve never had to try to play with anyone. It’s probably outside of my skill set. I just don’t want to disappoint you guys, that’s all.” I hurried through my list of excuses trying to convince them to look elsewhere but I went wrong somehow. They only seemed to grow more determined the farther down my lame pile of excuses I got.
	“How about we just start with one song, yeah?” Ryder asked just a fraction more gently but it was enough to break down my resolve. “You play one song with us and decide from there.”
	I hesitated, wanting to say yes, but needing to say no. 
Phoenix looked at me expectantly, the energy in his body slowly building again until he bounced with the restrained excitement. “Come on, Ivy, we need you.” he pleaded with me, his hands pressed together in prayer position. 
	I opened my mouth to say yes when the office door flung wide and Mrs. Tanner hauled her large frame through the narrow space and gasped in horror at our little pow wow. “What is going on out here?” she snapped, her beady eyes falling immediately on me.
	“Hall pass!” Phoenix held up the awkward wooden board with an abrupt swing of his arm and started walking backwards toward his classroom. “Check you guys later.” 
	I waved at Phoenix limply and waited for Tanner the Wench’s wrath. I leaned back against the wall Ryder was resting on and worked my expression into bored. Not that I wasn’t feeling the sharp pangs of panic, but it was more important to piss Mrs. Tanner off than anything else in the world. 
	“Where’s your hall pass Ivy Pierce?” Mrs. Tanner snapped. 
	“I don’t have one. Yet,” I clipped the “t” sharply just to get under her skin.
	“Ryder? Please don’t tell me you’re abusing your office aide privileges with her,” Mrs. Tanner asked desperately in a high shriek.
	Before he could even speak, a pang of guilt punched me in the stomach and I knew I had to salvage what was left of Ryder’s reputation. “Not to worry, T. Ryder wouldn’t be caught dead helping the likes of me. He’s smarter than that, aren’t you Ryder?” But before he could answer I pushed off from the wall and walked purposefully toward my locker located on the opposite end of the hall. “He was in the middle of sending me to you.”
	“You’re not getting a pass from me,” she laughed bitterly and shook her head, gray tinged hair flying.
	“That’s what I told him,” I tossed my thumb over my shoulder and rolled my eyes for her benefit. “I’d much rather take the detention than have to deal with you this early in the morning anyway.” 
	“Careful little girl or it will be worse than a detention,” Mrs. Tanner hissed. 
	I mashed my lips together dramatically and then zipped them closed with my forefinger and thumb before walking on. I didn’t even bother to stop by my locker. I shoved my cropped jacket into my backpack on my way to class and didn’t slow down until I had been reprimanded by my Government teacher and slid to safety in the seventies era desk. 
	My heart hammered in my chest, pounding out my guilt and shame for including Ryder on the rollercoaster I lived on. He was crazy to spend more time with me, to ask questions about my life. So much could happen to him, to me…. to us. 
	And yet my hand still vibrated with little tingles where he touched me. 
	The morning of classes was a blur of movement and confusion. I knew I went to all of my classes, and walked through the halls to get there, but my mind stayed busy with thoughts of Ryder. Always Ryder. I went over his song, the car ride home last night, his interaction with Nix and then again this morning over and over and over until I felt a little bit crazy. The constant argument of whether he was drawn to me because of my curse or that I was completely misreading his intentions warred back and forth in my head until the voices felt like they were screaming at each other. 
	By the time I walked into lunch I gave up trying to declare a clear winner and gave into the fuzzy haze of exhaustion instead. I avoided the buffet line completely and wandered over to Chase, hoping to extract the easy warmth he readily gave out. The rest of our little group was stretched out on the long benches, munching away at their meals, completely blind to the turmoil spinning inside me. 
	“Hey,” Chase murmured against my hair before he pressed a kiss to my temple. 
	“Hey,” I sighed right back, leaning into him. Instant relief settled over me and I felt myself take my first full breath of the morning. 
	That is until I lifted my eyes and accidentally met Ryder’s disapproving stare from across the table. His granite eyes were back and colder than ever. He shook his head slowly as if I didn’t feel bad enough from the look he sent me. His eyes shifted to Chase for just a second before coming back to me. His message was clear.
	Just last night Nix gave me a direct order to date him for two more weeks. But Ryder was right. I couldn’t keep stringing Chase along. I couldn’t treat him like this. Not when he had been so great to me. A shaky breath vibrated through me and I pulled my courage together.
	Knowing Nix was out of the country might have helped too.
	“Hey, can we go somewhere?” I asked in a subdued voice so only Chase could hear.
	“Sure,” he smiled down at me until he noticed my expression. “Everything okay?”
	“Let’s just go somewhere,” I stood up quickly and fled from the cafeteria with all of its prying eyes. I felt Chase close behind me but didn’t turn around until we had slipped out a west side door that faced the art museum. The drizzle had stopped for now, but the gray October sky promised more rain to follow. The grass between the school and marbled art museum was brown with the threat of winter and soggy and slick with mud.  
	“Ivy?” Chase asked when I kept my space from him outside and crossed my arms.
	“Chase,” my voice faltered before I even started with the hard stuff. “You’re really great-”
	“Oh, no,” he sighed. He ran his hands over his face roughly and then had to push his dirty blonde hair out of his eyes. “I’m not going to like this am I?” 
	“I jumped into this too soon, I think,” it felt weird being truthful with him. But this was the truth. I was breaking up with Chase for all the right reasons, even if I would have done the same thing for the wrong ones. “I’m just not ready for any kind of relationship. Not even a slow one.”
	“You’re breaking up with me before we were really ever together?” Chase turned his back on me and pressed two palms against the rough stone of the building like he could push through it. 
	“I just don’t want you to think that this was you or anything you did,” I rushed to offer promises. “This is all me. I’m just still… broken,” I admitted lamely. My voice filled with emotion and my lungs felt closed off and drowning with dread, but between the two of us there was nothing. I didn’t know Chase enough to really be upset about it. The only emotions I felt were selfish and shallow. I felt bad for letting him down and guilty for letting the curse pull him in only to push him right back out.
	“What is that? An it’s not you, it’s me speech?” He looked over his shoulder at me. His cheeks red with frustration and his eyes shifted to hard blue orbs of anger, but he was a good enough man to treat me gently. 
	“No,” I swore. And then hated the lie. “Okay, maybe?”
	That earned me a small crack in his surly demeanor and he smiled at me. “I really like you, Ivy.” His words were a harsh whisper of declaration.
	“No, you don’t,” I whispered back. “You think you do. But you deserve someone who can give you everything, who can give you a complete version of a relationship.” The truth hurt as it came out of my mouth, like it was barbed and prickly and ripped from my throat. It settled into the air like weights pressing against my chest, oppressive and suffocating.
	“What if I would rather have you?” Chase turned around so he could face me again. He brushed away the leftover gravel on his hands against his pants. His gaze was piercing, demanding. 
	“You can’t have me, Chase.”
	We stared at each other for a few moments while he accepted this truth. There was no real connection between us; our interest in each other had barely been two weeks long. Still, the curse was hard to walk away from. That was the whole point.
	Sailors to their graves and all.
	“Does anyone get to have you, Ivy?” he asked somberly. His blue eyes were the deepest I’d seen them, dark rises of ocean waves. 
	I shook my head and looked away. 
	Nope, no one got me. And I planned to save all mankind by keeping that true.
	“When you’re, um, not broken anymore?” I lifted my eyes to meet his very serious ones. “Think of me?”
	“When I’m not broken anymore, Chase, you will be the first person I think of.” My throat was thick and coated with emotion and not even because of Chase. 
	Because I knew there wouldn’t be a time when I wasn’t broken. 
	Only a time when I would be free.
	Chase shot me one more of his adorable grins and seemed to accept his defeat with grace. “Ivy,” he nodded as way of goodbye.
	“Goodbye Chase,” I forced a smile back and then watched him slip back into the building. 
	I stood outside in the damp air, the chilly wind coasting across my arms and face. I had no energy to face the halls of high school again after that. I felt emotionally drained and empty. Another breakup was just a reminder in the long list of reasons my life would never be what it should be. Born into this world, I was already a slave. And unless I worked out my own freedom, I would remain a slave until the day I died. 
	My phone chimed with a new text message. I pulled it out of my jeans pocket and didn’t recognize the number although it was local. 
	Thank you for that.
	For what? Who is this?
	For Chase. Ryder.
	Freaking Ryder.
	How did you get my number? I wasn’t exactly surprised that he had it. But still. 
	Your file.
	You have access to my file? What the hell…. I kind of wanted to strangle him at this point.
	Not why I’m texting. Band practice tonight. I will pick you up. 7.
	But I just broke up with Chase.
	And I still need you.
	My heart started pounding fast and hard in my chest and even though the rational part of my brain screamed he was only talking about the band, I couldn’t help but repeat that phrase over and over and over. I still need you. I still need you. I still need you. 
	And even though I knew this was the opportunity to run, to cut ties completely with Ryder and that entire circle of friends that deserved more than knowing me…. I could take on the wrestling team. Or band geeks. Or drop out of school today and save everyone the hassle of dealing with me. My fingers were typing out my response before anything logical and sane registered. Instead the rush of those words were all that I felt. 
	I still need you. 
	That’s what sealed the deal.
	Fine.

Chapter Twenty-Four

	“My cell number is not in my file,” I declared irritably when I climbed into Ryder’s death trap that night.
	I had been waiting on the stairs in front of the circular drive in front of my apartment building for fifteen minutes and I was cold and a little bit damp. Even though Nix was out of the country and my mom was off on a date, I hated the idea of Ryder stepping foot in my building again. I wanted him nowhere near where the Queen of the Damned, aka my mother, resided. Nor did I want him caught on security tape entering the building. And even though I was extremely annoyed with him for making me do this stupid band thing… Okay, I was annoyed because he made me want to do the band thing… I wasn’t stupid enough to draw attention to him twice in one week. 
	Did I really think Nix checked the security tape of our building whenever he was away, which was usually most of the time? 
	No.
	Well. Maybe.
	I wouldn’t put it past him.
	It was a risk I was not willing to take anyway. 
	“It’s not?” Ryder asked completely innocently. He shot me a crooked smile from the driver’s seat of his Bronco, not even calling attention to the fact I didn’t say hello. I kind of liked him more for that. He wasn’t all about being polite. He could just roll with anything.  
	“No, it’s not.”
	“Oh,” he said thoughtfully while pulling onto Farnam. He ran a hand through his wild mess of hair, making it stand up on its ends. “Huh.”
	“Huh,” I mimicked in an exaggerated tone. 
	“Okay, Phoenix gave it to me,” he admitted without looking at me. His profile was shaded by the evening darkness, only spotlighted every once in a while by a streetlamp or stoplight. I could make out just the barest scruff along his jaw line, not enough to hide the way his neck muscles moved when he swallowed nervously. He probably had the sexiest neck alive. Which was weird of me to think. Right? How sexy could a neck be? It had to be the Adam’s apple, or the pronounced muscles… Or the way it connected to his broad shoulders.
	I blinked to work myself off of that bizarre thought train.
	“And how did Phoenix get it?” He was hiding something, I could feel it. My fingers itched to get to the bottom of this, although I had no idea why he was creating so much mystery.
	“He got it from Chase,” he breathed on a whisper like he was hiding it. I shot him a meaningful look that demanded he finish his story but he just kept his eyes on the street ahead while he turned left at the next block and then left again so that he could head east on Harney. 
	“When?”
	Ryder didn’t answer.
	“Really, after I broke up with him?” I demanded in a tone full of accusation.
	“Ivy, you guys were never really going out,” Ryder was so carefully controlled, so condescending that I had to sit on my hands to keep from smacking his arm. 
	Granted I wouldn’t have done much damage. 
	“Fine, we weren’t really going out. That doesn’t mean rub it in the guy’s face,” I huffed.
	“Why is that?” Suddenly Ryder was staring at me. His gray eyes piercing through the darkness, pinning me to my seat. The car was stalled at a stoplight so he just sat there, staring at me, and waiting for me to answer. “Chase has known you not even two weeks and as far as I know you guys never…”
	“We didn’t,” I rushed to explain away the doubt in his voice. At least sex would explain somewhat of an attachment to me. There wasn’t enough air in the car, not even to breathe. I reached for the hand-roll to crank the window down but stopped myself before I could follow the impulse through. 
	“Then why the devastation? Why the despair? Couldn’t you have walked away friends? What did you say to the guy to break his heart?” The light turned green, but Ryder just kept staring at me. 
	“It’s green,” I whispered.
	“I know,” he snapped back and pushed his foot down on the accelerator too hard. The Bronco lurched and groaned but hardly picked up any real speed. “Seriously Ivy, what did you say to Chase to crush him so badly?”
	I took three long breaths, trying to find my equilibrium. I’d never had to answer these questions before. Usually, if I stayed in the same dating circle, whoever I moved onto next was just grateful I chose them. Yes, it was sick and destroyed friendships. But I didn’t have a choice. It was what I did. 
	What I would do if I didn’t get out of here.
	Ryder demanding answers for my behavior wasn’t fair. It wasn’t. He had no idea the kind of pressure I was under. Or what my mother expected of me.
	My own mother.
	I scratched at my wrist tattoo that was back to being carefully covered up. It was burning like the tattletale it wanted to be.
	“I didn’t say anything!” I all but shouted. “You don’t know anything about us, Ryder, so you have no right to say those things!”
	“You must have said something though,” Ryder pushed, not caring at all that I was upset. “You broke his heart! After two weeks, you managed to break his heart!” His hand rammed through his hair, and his jaw ticked with frustration. 
	There it was. The words that had been spoken so many times in conjunction with me. The words that haunted me. Chased me in my sleep. That never gave me a moment’s peace. I broke his heart. After one freaking week, he was broken.
	Just like everyone else before him.
	Just like Sam.
	Just like me.
	“You know who I am, Ryder. It’s not like it’s this great big secret!” My voice was reaching a screeching pitch now, I was all but hysterical. “You’ve seen the tattoo. You’ve heard all the rumors. Don’t act so surprised just because it plays out in front of you. Let’s not forget, you’re the one that begged me to break up with him.”
	Ryder pulled the Bronco over to the side of the road, parallel parking with disgusting ease. He didn’t even have to try more than once. He just pulled right into the tight spot and turned the car off. 
	Abruptly the air became silent between us. There was no loud groan of the engine, no traffic whirring by alongside us. There was only us, in the quiet of the front seat, bathed in the light of the streetlamp overhead. 
	“Ivy,” Ryder started, but his voice was low and careful.
	“Don’t Ryder. Believe me, there is nothing you can say that can make me feel worse. I didn’t want to hurt Chase, okay? I like Chase. I think he’s great. Just because it was never going to work between us, didn’t mean I wanted to hurt him.” I stared out the window desperate to avoid Ryder’s intelligent eyes or scornful expression. He parked in a long line of cars parallel with the Gene Leahy Outdoor Mall to my right. The trees drooped in autumn death in a perfect line spaced exactly apart from each other. The hills and hills of grass that broke up the downtown industrial-ness in a five city-block long park were brown with the injury of frost-filled nights and barren of the people that usually occupied them during the spring and summer months. 
	“And there was no way to be more gentle with him? I get that you have your hang-ups, but Ivy, really, there had to be a better-”
	“Stop it,” I bit out. “You don’t know what you’re talking about. I was as nice as I could be.”
	“I’m sure you were,” Ryder said in a pacifying voice that really pissed me off. “But maybe if you had just thought-”
	“Enough,” I shrieked. “You weren’t there. You weren’t. And you don’t know what was said. Besides that, Chase isn’t some breakable doll. He’s going to be fine. Stop treating him like he’s fragile. Have more respect for your friend.”
	“Is that what you think? You think I’m coddling him? You have no idea what you do to men, do you? You have no idea how you affect them!” he was shouting back at me, enunciating certain words with anger and gripping the steering wheel like he wanted to rip it off.
	His emotion infuriated me, and he had no idea. He just happened to press every single one of my buttons and he probably expected an apology. Only the thing was, I couldn’t even be mad at him. He shouldn’t be punished for being right. And he certainly shouldn’t be punished because I was cursed.
	“You’re right,” I gave in. Suddenly I was very tired. “I should have handled things differently with Chase.”
	I watched Ryder open his mouth and then close it out of the corner of my eye and didn’t know what to make of his eventual silence. He just kept staring at me, like he could see through me, all the way through me. And not in the way that made me feel like I didn’t exist, but in the way that made me feel like I very much existed. Like his stare could reach every single piece of me I tried to hide, tried to tuck away. Like his eyes were super powered and he had no issue with finding every single vulnerable place inside me and shining his bright, brilliant silver spotlight on every last nook and cranny. 
	“Chase is my friend,” Ryder finally settled on the obvious. “But so are you, Ivy. If you want to talk, I will listen.”
	I swung my head around to finally focus on those unsettling grays.
	“I can’t-”
	“I didn’t ask that,” Ryder cut me off, his expression fierce and hopeful all at the same time. “I won’t ever ask more of you than you can give. But if you want to, I am here for you.”
	I don’t know what my face looked like, or what emotion he watched cross my face because honestly I didn’t even know. My blood grew hot with the multitude of them, my skin prickling with something. I felt like my wires were crossed, like my heart knew something my brain didn’t because it was pounding in my chest with painful purpose. I shook my head as if to remind myself not to say anything to him, not to even hint at the real purpose. 
	But I found the words bubbling up before I could stop them; they swam their way to the surface and made it all the way to the tip of my tongue before I could even register what a terrible idea this was.
	“Ryder, what you don’t know is… there’s actually a lot you don’t-”
	Banging on Ryder’s window scared the ever living hell out of me and a blood curdling scream wrenched from my mouth, covering whatever terrible truth I was about to confess. 
	“What are you guys doing in there?” Phoenix shouted through the closed window, his voice muffled by the glass.
	Phoenix. Good grief. 
	My heart beat more frantically than ever against my battered rib cage, and sweat formed at my hairline and lower back. Holy hell, that reminded me of Nix the other night and I was fairly certain I nearly died of a brain aneurism. 
	“I’m sorry,” I panted out of breath. I clutched a hand to my neck and cleared my throat nervously. “I’m really sorry.”
	Ryder looked at me with concerned shock before finally rolling down the window for Phoenix. “Was that necessary?”
	“Sorry, Ives,” Phoenix apologized sheepishly. “I didn’t mean to scare you.” 
	“It’s fine,” I waved a dismissive hand, but I was still out of breath. “Honestly, it is. I just wasn’t expecting you.”
	“Are you okay?” Ryder faced me again, his eyes gentled with worry.
	“Yes, seriously, I am. I just scare easily,” I tried to laugh, but let’s be real, I sounded a little deranged. Yep, we were never visiting this conversation again. Obviously, this was the universe’s way of warning me.
	“You want to go get started?” Ryder asked in that same patient tone. “If you’re not up for it, I can just take you home.”
	And I knew he would. If I wasn’t up for this, Ryder would let me go. 
	I both loved that and hated it at the same time.
	I didn’t want him to let me go.
	“I’m up for it.”
	And I was. At least for tonight.

Chapter Twenty-Five

	I followed Ryder and Phoenix across the street to a standalone brick building with two floors of apartments on top of a small-ish, independent bank. The building was quaint and kind of adorable. There were boxes for flowers hanging out of every second and third story window, but they were empty now because of the season. There was another standalone brick building directly to the east of it, but it was larger and a lighter shade brick than Ryder’s and to the west a block down was the Holland Center, a gorgeous modern performing arts center made of steel and glass. 
	We entered Ryder’s building through a side door using a keypad access and came immediately to the stairwell. The building was absolutely quiet and dark, the only disruption our footsteps echoing off the tile floor as the sound got lost in the open stairwell. 
	We climbed the long flight of stairs in silence, while Phoenix beat his drumsticks against anything that got in his way: his jean-clad thigh, the bannister, the steps in front of him, Ryder’s back, my arm. There was obviously a song playing in his head, but he was the only one that could hear it. And in the fast flicking of his hands holding the sticks, I realized where all that contained energy was channeled too. Even though his fingers were constantly moving with rhythm his face was calm now, placid and relaxed. It was like this outlet for him completely sedated him, but in a way that was all creative genius. 
	At the top of the stairs, Ryder opened the heavy metal door with another key and led us into his apartment. 
I was honestly surprised to walk directly into his living space, I expected there to be… I don’t know, more to the upstairs. Instead, Ryder’s home consisted of the entire third floor of the building. The loft space was mostly open and heavy with industrial design. There was an incredible round concrete table that took up way more space than I could imagine necessary for a family of three. And there were these rusted looking metal chairs that were clearly one of a kind. They had high narrow backs, but wide seats that were fit almost like old tractor seats, maybe? Weird. The kitchen was darker tones of concrete, and mixed with a 1950’s inspired collection of appliances. The living room was dark, worn leather couches and a mixture of recycled wood turned into a low coffee table and unique end tables. The living room also faced the street-side windows and was completely devoid of electronic entertainment. Doors to what I assumed were either bedrooms or bathrooms broke up the wall space around the room and I couldn’t help but wonder which one led to Ryder’s.
“What do you think?” Ryder asked in a quiet, self-conscious voice. 
Phoenix’s drums suddenly burst through the apartment in random thuds and thumps of energy. While he warmed up I couldn’t bite back the smile. 
“I love it,” I answered. I did love it. I loved the scattered newspaper covering the coffee table, the forgotten about coffee cups still sitting in front of pushed out chairs at the table. I loved the smell of some kind of spicy dinner that remained in the air, Ryder’s indoor soccer gear piled in a messy heap by the door. I loved that this place felt like a home. I loved that his home was lived in. “Where did you find all this…. stuff? Who did your dad hire?” I laughed taking in the ginormous table. That must have been insane to move up three flights of stairs and through the narrow door. 
“Hire? You mean a decorator?” Ryder’s face was scrunched up in confusion. I nodded though, wondering absently what my mom would think about all this. “We didn’t hire anybody. My dad has a soft spot for student art and my uncle is big on the whole Renew, Reuse, Recycle thing. Together, they created this…. mess.”
“Mess?” I barely held back my offended gasp.
“Yes, Ivy. Mess. This isn’t a decorating scheme. This is Goodwill meets the Habitat for Humanity Restore shop and has a love child with every starving artist in the city. It’s definitely a mess.” Ryder laughed at my expression and I had the urge to smack his arm again.
“Fine, if it’s a mess, it’s a beautiful mess.” I conceded.
“My dad will be so happy to hear that.” He shook his head at me and then walked over to the corner of the living room where Phoenix was still beating away at his drum set. 
While Ryder pulled out an acoustic guitar and plugged it into his amp I looked down at my royal blue knit dress that stopped mid-thigh and my designer wedge boots. Then I thought about my worn out Chucks in my closet at home and decided something very crucial. I wasn’t either of those people. I was this person. Whoever lived in this house, that’s who I was.
	And for a moment I felt this overwhelming peace, like suddenly I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted out of life. And surprisingly it was more than just escaping.
	Suddenly I didn’t just want freedom, or escape. 
I wanted a house, and people to love.
	And someone that loved me.
	But then the sounds of guitar strings being tuned broke through the incessant drum beats and I forced myself back to reality.
	I shuddered at my thinking because this wasn’t an abstract daydream, I knew the person that lived here. It was weird that I wanted to be him.
	Or have his life.
	Or be a part of his life.
	No. No… I just wasn’t used to being in a happy home. High school house parties were hardly the testament of a loving, doting family and any other time I was invited into a house was with someone from the circle. 
	So, that’s all this was. Nostalgia. Nostalgia for something I didn’t know.
	“Hayden and Cole are coming later. And Hudson can’t make it tonight,” Ryder explained when Phoenix finally stopped messing around. “We thought you could try it out with us first, Red, and then when you’re comfortable with the rest of the band.”
	“Sure,” I mumbled trying to get back to business. “I don’t think it will make a difference, but whatever you want. Do you at least have sheet music? I mean, I’m not good enough to just make something up.” My tone was impatient and abrupt. Panic flashed like strobe lights inside me and the unsettling feeling of wanting something I could never have seriously messed me up. This was more than uncomfortable, this was terrifying.
	“No one expected you to be,” Ryder’s voice had that patient, gentle tone again, like he knew I was going through something just standing in his living room.
	Damn him.
	I wasn’t fragile. I lived through a lot of crap. I faced dangerous situations sometimes. Like real danger. He didn’t need to treat me with kid gloves.
	“So, sheet music?” I pressed.
	“It’s over on the counter,” Ryder gestured with his chin and I dutifully walked over to get the small stack of loose leaf music. 
	“Is Kenna coming tonight?” I heard Phoenix ask in a muffled voice once my back was turned.
	Ryder didn’t respond, so I almost turned around to ask the question for Phoenix again when Phoenix’s voice made me stop and pretend to fiddle with something on this side of the room.
	“Why not?” Phoenix’s voice dropped lower, almost so I couldn’t make it out.
	Ryder replied with something I couldn’t understand from here and my curiosity peeked further.
	“Why do you think that?” Phoenix asked, outraged. I heard Ryder shush him and I imagined his angry eyes shutting Phoenix right up. “You’re crazy man. She would never.”
	More of Ryder’s mumbling. Phoenix made a half grunt, half scoffing noise and then suddenly banged his drumsticks down onto the head of his cymbal. The loud crashing broke up whatever they were talking about and practically burst my inner eardrum. 
	“Well, Ivy, you ready? Let’s get to this,” Ryder commanded suddenly as if the cymbal crash never happened.
	Or maybe Phoenix did that all the time and Ryder was just used to it. I was not used to it and half expected my ear to be bleeding. 
	“Sure,” I answered unenthusiastically. 
	I walked over to where a decent Korg was set up facing the drum set. There were about a million buttons on the top of the instrument and the plastic keys were narrow and not enough octaves long. I struggled to hide my grimace at the foreign instrument while I placed my fingers into and an easy C chord and pressed down. The sudden loudness of the triad made me jump and release the keys. The sound immediately stopped, nothing resonated afterward, nothing happened, there just wasn’t sound anymore. 
	“You’ve played a keyboard before, right?” Ryder asked deadpan. 
	“Oh yeah, lots of times,” I lied but sounded obvious enough that I didn’t feel guilty about it.
	I ignored the look Ryder and Phoenix were giving each other and took a breath to settle my nerves. I fiddled with the volume button, turning down the sound so it wouldn’t rival Phoenix’s cymbals and then pressed down on the same chord again. The keys were lighter than I was used to, there was no weight to press into, no heavy feeling of accomplishment. It was just… easy. 
	With my fingers pressed down, I wiggled them around a little, getting used to the width of each key. When I finally felt like I could wrap my head around the plastic feel of the keys, I lifted off and began moving my fingers in quick scales up and down the shortened octaves. After a while, I flexed my fingers, loving the warm feeling tingling in each joint. 
	“Wow, you’re really good,” Phoenix commented in awe.
	“Phoenix, I was just warming up,” I sighed, a bit exasperated. 
	“Fine, let’s hear it then,” Ryder commanded in his gravelly voice. I looked up and accidentally caught his eye. He was staring at me intently, waiting for me to wow him. Only… I didn’t want to wow him. I wanted to walk across the room and kiss him. Like attack him with kisses.
	What the hell?
	Obviously, those psychotic thoughts were enough to get me to move my ass. Instead of Ryder’s mouth, I attacked the keys, throwing myself into Piano Concerto by Tchaikovsky. I immediately ran out of keys on the small set of octaves, so I switched to something more contemporary. I ended up not really having the range for that either, so I improvised.
	“That’s beautiful,” Ryder commented. He walked across the small practice space and stood hovering over me while my fingers moved nimbly up and down the cheap plastic keyboard.
	“At times,” I murmured and then hit a section of harsh, discordant notes. 
	Ryder laughed softly at the broken, mismatched chords being played before they were switched back to light and airy and sweet again. “What is it?”
	I lifted my gaze from my fingers to meet his silver eyes without realizing it. “Romance,” I heard myself say out loud in an embarrassingly breathy voice. I cleared my throat and focused back on my hands. “Jean Sibelius.”
	My fingers danced and flew, crossing over each other and then crossing back. I didn’t have a pedal, so the piece sounded choppy and broken up and the very low notes and very high notes were absent, leaving much to be desired, but the captivating melody was there. And I was there, caught up in the music, lost in the swell and intensity as the melody carried us through what I pictured real life romance to be like, easy at first, passionate, consuming, difficult as real life set in, confusing, infuriating, discontented and then back to the best notes, the best sounds and ending with both hands on chords that complimented each other, that made the other whole…. that finished each other. 
	My fingers lay heavily on the last notes because once I removed them I knew the music would be gone. That it would be quiet again. And even as the last of the sound faded away I stared down at my tense fingers waiting for it.
	Ryder placed a hand on top of my own. I stared at the way his tanned, masculine fingers contrasted with the pale ivory of mine. His thumb moved against mine in a sweeping gesture of comfort. “You’re incredible,” he whispered gently.
	I mashed my lips together, forgetting everything else in the room. I lifted my eyes to meet his and the breath caught in my throat. His eyes were liquid pools of silver, intense and exposed all at the same time. “You’re really incredible, Ivy,” he whispered again once he had my attention. 
	“Thank you,” I meant to reply but was only capable of mouthing the words. 
	Finally my fingers lifted from the keys and whatever was left of the faint sounds disappeared completely. Phoenix started clapping obnoxiously before he stood and started whistling for me. “Holy shit, Ivy, that was insane.”
	I blushed, realizing I had never just had fun playing for anyone before. My mother used my talent to impress dates or Nix. Nix used this to intimidate other legacies. And I hadn’t taken private lessons in three years.    
	“Thanks guys,” I breathed, all of a sudden embarrassed.
	“You’re like a musical ninja,” Phoenix bounced over, staring at my hands like they were aliens. 
	“Definitely a musical ninja, Red,” Ryder agreed with a smirk on his lips.
	“Yes!” Phoenix exclaimed suddenly. “The ginger ninja…. the Ginga Ninja!”
	I burst into laughter. The ginga ninja? Was he serious? 
	“We’ll make t-shirts,” Phoenix continued, bouncing on his toes. He was like a human version of Tigger. “You can thank me later.” 
	A loud buzzing interrupted our laughter and Phoenix looked up sharply at me and then swiveled his head to Ryder. “I’ll get it,” he announced. “It’s probably just Hayden and Cole.”
	Before Ryder could remind him this was his house, Phoenix disappeared out the door and into the stairwell.
	“Don’t you have a button up here to let them in?” I asked with my eyes on the door.
	“They probably need help with their equipment,” Ryder explained. His hand on mine again drew my attention back to him. When I faced him he wasn’t laughing anymore, his expression completely serious. “I like it when you laugh, Ivy,” he admitted in a low voice. 
	I stood there breathless and frozen. His gaze delved into mine, capturing it, holding it hostage and the heat from his hand scorched my skin wherever it touched me. The keyboard still separated us, but that was the only thing separating us. Other than physical contact, I felt completely drawn into him, Ryder, like he encapsulated all of me, every hidden, secret part of me. And I was helpless against him.
	No.
	I chose to be helpless. I wanted this. 
	Wanted him. 
	Which was crazy. These feelings were crazy. If Ryder had feelings for me there was only one explanation for them. The curse. Always the curse. And even if I could make arguments day and night to why he had never been affected by it before, the truth was that I would always doubt myself. Always. If I acted on my own feelings and there happened to be something between us, I would never be able to trust it.
	I would never be able to trust him.
	There would never be a way to know that his attachment to me was not because of the curse.
	And so I needed to stamp these thoughts and feelings down immediately. If not sooner. If not yesterday….
	His tongue ran across his bottom lip, and his gaze dropped to my mouth. I just talked myself out of this, so I should move. 
	Now. I should move now.
	My breath returned to my chest in fast, heavy pants. My chin tilted up without my permission, like a sunflower to the sun. 
	Ryder’s gaze heated to desire, his eyes hooded with heavy lids, his mouth opened. He leaned forward, we were just inches apart. Just three inches. “Ivy, I-”
	The door to the apartment exploded open with the sounds of banging equipment and three loud boys laughing about something completely grotesque. Ryder and I broke apart immediately, his hand removed from mine, his attention back to his guitar. We avoided each other’s gazes and my blush was definitely back.
	I might like this band thing.
	I might like this circle of friends.
	But that could never happen again.
	Ever.
	Except when I caught Ryder looking at me not four seconds later, I quickly remembered that you were never supposed to say never…

Chapter Twenty-Six

	I followed the sheet music religiously. It was the only way I knew how to play. To be honest, it was a bit embarrassing that I didn’t have the creative ingenuity to just improvise. Especially when that seemed to be what everyone else was doing. 
	Especially Ryder.
	I knew he was talented, but he didn’t have to be the smart kind of talented that made everyone else feel stupid. 
	I took private lessons for eight years. Eight. 
	He apparently picked up his dad’s guitar at twelve and turned into a prodigy. 
	Ugh. 
	“I can’t do this,” I grumbled at the end of the millionth play through. It was this melancholy ballad with a pretty piano melody that played above everything else. Ryder’s voice sang rough and raw about a lonely girl with eyes that saw everything and a heart that felt nothing.
	As soon as Ryder started singing the lyrics I shot him a sharp look, but he shook his head to deny it. Since then I had been living in a world I liked to refer to as blissfully ignorant. Although, others might have called it denial. Still, if he said it wasn’t about me, then who was I to disagree? Also, I didn’t want to be the girl he was singing about. She sounded sad, and alone and…. empty.
	And I wasn’t empty.
	Mostly, I was just…. afraid. 
	Of so many things.
	“You were better that time,” Ryder called encouragingly after the last notes of the song drifted off to nothing. “You were uh, more on time.”
	I blushed immediately, a deep red that painted my skin. I could feel the heat in my face and across my collar bone, but there wasn’t anything I could do about it. I wasn’t used to being bad at something. “This is so different than what I’m used to.”
	“You’re doing really well, Ivy. Ryder’s a bastard,” Phoenix encouraged from behind his drums. His hairline and the collar of his shirt were damp with sweat but he never stopped twirling his drum sticks. If he wasn’t throwing his entire body into the song, then he twirled them between his long fingers while he waited for the next one to start. He looked extra gangly perched upon the tiny drum stool, but this was exactly his element, exactly where I could tell he felt most alive. 
	“Thanks Phoenix,” I smiled at him and his whole face lit up. The curse was extra hard to control when music was involved, but these guys seemed to be okay. Besides, all my frustration and failure probably obscured whatever elevated affects swirled around in the air.
	“I didn’t mean that you weren’t doing well, Red,” Ryder immediately put in and I could tell he felt bad for all of his “helpful” tips that had been fraying my nerves for the last two hours. “I was just trying to say that was the best you’ve sounded. I get that this isn’t easy for you.”
	“It’s fine, Ryder,” I offered politely. “I get that this is your thing. I don’t want to mess it up for you. But I did tell you this would be a problem. I won’t be offended if you guys don’t want me after all.”
	“We want you,” Hayden piped up quickly. “Ivy, I want you at least.”
	Ugh, that so sounded like an innuendo coming from him.
	“Creep much, Hayd?” Cole grunted. I could tell Cole was just as interested in me as Hayden was, but his shy nature and quiet personality kept him from turning into stalker material. 
	“Shut it, Cole,” Hayden grumbled.
	“Why don’t you both shut up and leave her alone?” Phoenix’s voice rose above both of them. 
	Okay, and this was my cue to leave.
	“Actually, I have to get home before my curfew,” I announced cavalierly. “Sorry to break up practice.” 
	Everyone gave a whine of disappointment but backed away from the fight that was about to break out. Well, everyone except Ryder sounded disappointed. I chanced a peek at him, but he was already looking at me, eyes narrowed, expression tense. His hand was half way through his hair and tugging at the roots. 
	“I’ll just take these,” I picked up the sheet music and then tapped them against the smooth top of the keyboard so they all lined up together. “I can practice at home on my real piano and hopefully next time…. uh, if there is a next time….”
	After a long, awkward few moments of silence Ryder finally relieved my tension, “See what you can do at home and then we’ll try again in a few days. Maybe you and I can just get together and see if you can hear the guitar melody a bit better.”
	“Sure, sounds great,” I smiled but there was no enthusiasm in my voice. Ryder had to have been able to tell, but he just kept looking at me like he was waiting for me to come clean about something. 
	The band began to pick up various pieces of equipment and instruments and pack them away. I glanced at the microwave clock in the kitchen desperate to be away from all this competitive testosterone, hating that these guys felt a contest over me and then hating that I felt disappointed Ryder wasn’t trying to join in.  
	I stood awkwardly outside of the practice area, since I didn’t know how to put anything away and my only task was picking up my sheet music. I tried not to stare at the band, but it was difficult. They were kind of fascinating with how much care they took with each piece of equipment or how cruel they were to each other… but in a funny, happy way. 
	Boys. They were so different from girls.
	I felt like I was a National Geographic photographer observing African lions in their natural habitat. Honestly, all I needed was a pair of cargo khakis and a British accent. 
	The male drummer turns to face his natural enemy, the male bass player. They eye each other for a while before the second guitarist jumps in with a harsh quip about the bass player’s frayed skull cap. This is the opportunity the drummer has been waiting for and he pounces on the bass player until he alone emerges victoriously-
	“What are you thinking about?” Ryder broke into my thought train so suddenly I nearly jumped out of my skin.
	“Nothing,” I squeaked. 
	“Really? Because you have this really deep-in-thought look on your face,” Ryder remarked honestly.
	The blush returned. “Um, are you going to take me home or should I call someone?” I changed the subject before he could ask any more questions, but I also really needed to know.
	“Actually, is it alright if Phoenix takes you? I was working earlier so it worked out, but it would be easier for me if he took you. You’re right on his way,” Ryder explained.
	See? No curse. If he felt the curse, no way would he send me away with another guy. 
	“Sure, that’s no problem,” I replied with so much energy Ryder shot me an offended look. “I mean,” I faltered a little, “whatever works for you.”
	“Uh-huh.” His eyes narrowed on me. “Are you okay with taking Ivy home, Phoenix?” 
	“Huh? Oh sure! Yeah, it’ll be fun, won’t it Ives?” Phoenix grinned at me with this huge, boyish smile and I had to fall in love with him just a little bit more. The feeling made me instantly want to text Exie and make up some excuse for her to meet me at my apartment just so she could run into him again. But then I quickly squashed it. Exie’s rules weren’t exactly the same as mine, but Nix still ran the show in her life. A relationship with anybody would eventually be terminated and I didn’t want to do that to Phoenix. Or Exie.
	“Yes, we will!” I gushed. “But can we go soon? I really do have a curfew I have to be back for.”
	“Sure. I’ve got everything packed up so we can just take off now,” Phoenix started walking toward the door, shooting Ryder a peace-out over his shoulder.
	Peace out?
	People still said peace out?
	Fifteen minutes later, Phoenix pulled up to my apartment in his beat up El Camino and told me how amazing it was to have me in the band for about the millionth time. He had been gushing nonstop since we left Ryder’s and I couldn’t even get one word in to remind him that I hadn’t played good at all. In fact, I was almost positive I was going to destroy their entire reputation and fan base.
	But that wasn’t something Phoenix could comprehend right now. 
	“Are you sure you guys don’t know anyone else that can play the piano? I mean there has to be somebody.” I turned in my seat, determined to help Phoenix remember somebody else that could fill this role.
	Phoenix looked at me for a beat. No, not looked, Phoenix examined me, took in everything about me with a lucidity I had never seen him use before. “Sure, there are other people that play, we could have asked others.”
	A breath of relief whooshed out of my lungs and I felt a huge burden lift off my shoulders. “Oh, good.”
	“But Ryder wants you.” Phoenix continued, not noticing my reaction at all, despite this new found clarity. “I think he thinks you’re a troubled teen. That you need like, an outlet or something.”
	Harsh laughter ripped out of my mouth. The statement was both true and ironic. And annoying. “He thinks I need an outlet?” 
	“Uh, yeah,” Phoenix mumbled, realizing he might have said something he wasn’t supposed.
	“He thinks I need an outlet? For my troubled behavior?” I ran through it again, just to make sure I had all the facts correct. Anger built inside me quickly the more I repeated the words in my head. “What does Ryder think will happen if I don’t have an outlet?” My voice rose to an angry screech and Phoenix flinched a bit. “Does he think, what, I’ll turn to drugs? Drinking? I’ll hurt someone again? What does he think will happen, Phoenix?” 
	“Uh….” Phoenix glanced at my apartment entry nervously before daring to meet my eyes. I didn’t mean to make him feel bad, but this was ridiculous. “I don’t know, Ivy. I just know he’s really worried about you. He cares about you. We all care about you.” 
	All of the dangerous energy left me in a rush of defeat. I slumped against the frayed maroon upholstery of the El Camino and slammed the back of my head against the head rest. People were not supposed to care about me. This was not supposed to happen. I had a checklist. 
1.Follow the rules.
2.Keep my head down.
3.Graduate.
4.Get the hell out of Dodge. 
	How did things get so messed up?
	“Are you going to quit?” Phoenix braved, his voice gentle and soothing.
	“No,” I gave in. This was a mistake, a huge mistake. But I couldn’t walk away from these people. I shouldn’t involve them in my life, and I certainly shouldn’t expect their feelings for me to be real… But I couldn’t walk away from them now. I cared about them too. “But I’m not this, this person Ryder’s made me out to be, okay, Phoenix? I’m just fine, really.”
	“If you say so, Ivy,” Phoenix shot me a sad smile. “But, uh, before you go… I’ve been meaning to ask you about, um, Exie?”
	Despite the mood I slipped into, I couldn’t stop smiling at Phoenix. “Yeah? Exie?”
	“Is she like, with anybody?” 
	“Um, not that I know of,” I encouraged. Even though I knew she actually was with somebody, but not somebody that mattered and she was probably plotting their breakup already anyway. 
	“So she gave me her number, but I didn’t know if she, you know… should I call her?” he asked so adorably nervous I couldn’t help but laugh a little.
	“Yes, Phoenix. If she gave you her number, you should definitely call her.” I was actually impressed with him. Exie did not just give out her number to random people. Even a lot of the guys she hooked up with didn’t get her cell number. Of course they also didn’t last more than a couple days. And I was hoping Phoenix would last for more than that. Exie had a chance at some happiness with Phoenix and I just wanted her to have that, have some happiness, for at least a little bit. 
	“Thanks Ivy,” his huge grin was back, lighting up his entire face. “See you tomorrow.”
	“Yep, thanks for the ride,” I climbed out of the car and all the way up the stairs, through the glass doors and to the elevator. This night turned out weird, fun, frustrating and…. just weird all the way around. 
	I didn’t know if I would ever find my equilibrium with Ryder. 
	The door to my apartment was open when I got off the elevator and a shot of nerves zapped through me. Shoot. 
	As the elevator doors quietly closed behind me my mother appeared in the doorway. Her bronzed red hair hanging loose and wild around her shoulders, her usually bright green eyes were dulled and anguished in the corners and her mouth was pressed into a grim line as she watched me approach. 
	Although our apartment building was not entirely full yet since it opened a few years ago, this floor was. However we didn’t know any of our neighbors. It was dangerous to get to know people where we lived, the curse was unpredictable and we preferred to live without the drama. Besides, my mother was a selfish creature and making friends was not necessarily a top priority for her.
	Her priorities started with making money and then only became variables of that. 
	Because we didn’t know our neighbors and didn’t care to know them, I knew I was safe until the door shut behind me, but walking down the long hall with her eyes so hatefully turned on me was intimidating. 
	To say the least.
	“Where have you been?” she snapped as the door clicked closed behind me. 
	She hadn’t moved, except to allow us privacy. Still framed in the doorway, her hands had moved aggressively to her hips and her eyes narrowed into slits of fury.
	“I was out with Chase,” I lied. Blatantly. 
	She seemed to chew that over for a minute before deciding that was an acceptable response. She forced a breath out and a wave of whisky hit me. Then she wobbled on her feet and I knew this was bad.
	She never drank whisky. Never. 
	Lady’s only ever drink delicate drinks. Save the hard stuff for the boys. 
	Still, when things went badly for her, she hit the sauce. And hard. 
	“Are you okay, mom?” I asked before thinking better of it. 
	“Of course, I’m okay,” she bit out, her relaxed eyes instantly tensing again. “Have you gained weight?”
I opened my mouth, closed it again and then opened it. “Um, no, I don’t think so.”
“Oh, well maybe you need to drop three pounds anyway, Ivy,” her tone was that pretending kind of care. A sick feeling washed over me and settled in my stomach. “You’re coming into womanhood and you don’t want that extra weight to settle in unflattering places.” I just nodded slowly. Three pounds felt like too much to me. I already barely ate. But mom wasn’t finished, she continued with “Did you dye your hair again?” 
	Her question caught me off guard. “No, not since I dyed it back.” I touched the end of my golden red hair and then held it up to the light. Before Sam I had gone through this super rebellious phase and dyed it black. It wasn’t so much this desire to get in touch with myself as it was to send a big F you to Nix and my mom. Of course it backfired when Sam crashed his car into the streetlight. But at the time I had felt pretty badass. 
	Now I knew better. Pissing off Nix and my mom only intensified their efforts to break me. The new game plan, to simply slip away in the dead of the night, was my only hope.
	“It looks darker. Oh, god, I hope this isn’t how it stays. You probably ruined it when you dumped all that black poison on it.” She took a step forward and grabbed a chunk full of my hair. Her fingers closed around a fistful of it, near the roots and she yanked it toward her. I winced a little when biting pain shot across the base of my neck and up to the crown of my head.
	“Ow, mom,” I whispered. 
	“Oh, did I hurt you?” she let go of my hair with so much force I stumbled backward. “Did I hurt you Ivy? God, you’re so pathetically fragile,” she waved her arms around as if to demonstrate the whole of me. My heart constricted into a tight ball in my chest. This wasn’t the first time she made this speech, nor would it be the last. Still, the wounds were always fresh, always just as painful. And the worst part about everything she was saying, was that it was all true. “Do you know what I was doing at your age, Ivy? Do you have any clue? I wasn’t running off for six months of spa treatments, that’s for goddamn sure. I had my priorities straight. I believed in my future. I was loyal. I have no idea how you are even my child. I was Nix’s choice too once, his trophy. I’ve been where you have, but the difference between me and you is that I treated my responsibilities with respect. I became the person I was supposed to be. I embraced my destiny. I need to get your sister back, she will know better. She will be better.”
	Angry tears pricked at my eyes, hot and ready to spill over. “This? This is who you were supposed to be?” I gestured at her with my hands now, at her black silk pants, and lavender halter top, at her outrageously expensive shoes, to her Cartier necklace and earrings. “I don’t want your destiny; I don’t want your responsibility. It’s so sick and disgusting that I can’t even stomach what you do. And I hope to God, Honor never comes here, never has to live through what I’ve lived through. I hope she never sees what kind of monster you really are.” The words were out before I could stop them. Our faces registered the shock at the same time. And while I stood there staring at her dumbfounded, she recovered first by slapping me across the face.
	The sound of her palm hitting my cheek resounded loudly between us. My mouth hung open stupidly, while the tears finally slipped out the corners of my eyes to my cheeks and then dripped carelessly off my chin. I brought a shaking hand up to my face and held it gently against the still stinging skin. 
	“Don’t ever speak like that to me again,” she growled in a hoarse voice. “How dare you.” 
	I closed my mouth with a clap of teeth hitting teeth, but I refused to apologize. This might be the dumbest thing I had ever done, but I wasn’t going to apologize. 
	“Go to your room,” she snarled viciously at me. “I’m calling Nix. I’m sure he will be so happy to hear how his therapy worked out for you.” 
	My chin trembled as her words hit me, the full realization of what I’d done finally settling over me. Damn it. So much for keeping my head down and just getting through this. 
	“You think you are so much better than me? So much better than everyone else! I will make damned sure that this is a lesson you learn from Nix. He can show you your place because I have no more patience for you.” She didn’t even look like herself. Her eyes were crazed and psychotic, her face screwed up with rage. In the motion it took her to slap me her hair became wild and out of place, her shirt a little off center and her eye liner smudged in the corner. She was a mess and suddenly unwanted pangs of sympathy flooded my veins like ice. I didn’t think I was better than her; I just wanted a better life.  “Go to your room, Ivy. I’ll call for you if I need you.”
	I didn’t say anything; I just turned on my heel and obeyed. Once the door was closed and locked behind me I collapsed on my bed in a heap of despair. The tears didn’t stop for a long time, they fell in relentless puddles mixed with snot and more emotions than I knew what to do with. Eventually I fell asleep with my mother’s threats and accusations rolling around in my head.
	And Ryder’s.
	And when I finally fell asleep it was only to dream of a troubled teen that couldn’t escape the ugly role life had dealt her. She never escaped. She never knew another life than slavery and submission. 
	Worst of all she never knew love. Not from her family, not from a man. 
	And not from herself.

Chapter Twenty-Seven

	The next morning was a blur of emotional dysfunction. I didn’t want to stay home where my mother was lurking, but school seemed like not the answer. Still, I went.
	Even though I knew I could still sit with Chase and his friends, it seemed like such a heartless thing to do. I didn’t mind remaining friends with Chase, and I apparently couldn’t get rid of Ryder and Phoenix, but the day after we ended it, seemed a little sudden to flaunt that in his face. 
	So after a morning of mindless classes I found myself wandering around the band room. I used to come here a lot, before Sam. Well, and during Sam. There are never any classes over the lunch period in this wing of the building, so it’s nice and quiet. But there is a hallway off the tiered band room filled with practice rooms and those are occupied a lot over lunch. 
	I love the muffled sounds of all the different instruments colliding in the hallway. The sounds individually could be beautiful, or strained or awful, but together, in the hallway they were complete chaos. It’s how I pictured the definition of “cacophony.” Not that I said that word often, but still, this hall was what a cacophony of sound…. sounded like. 
	But today everything was silent and still. I was alone. Which seemed fitting, since in my head I was anything but alone. 
	I walked all the way to the end of the hallway where it ran into a brick wall and entered the last small practice room without a sound. There was a piano set up on the far wall, and one extra chair besides the piano bench with a metal music stand in front of it. 
	I contemplated calling Exie or Sloane and opening up about how unhinged my mom was, but they had their own maternal problems. Besides, I wasn’t really sure what to do with it all. She had never been the most in-touch mom, especially lately. But she had never hit me before.
	I shivered in the damp room and let the silence wash over me. It was so loud, so deafeningly quiet that my ears rushed with the absence of sound and my skin felt physically oppressed by it. 
	Suddenly I couldn’t take it anymore, the soundlessness, the thoughts in my head, none of it. I yanked the piano bench back and slammed my body down. My fingers were flying up and down the keyboard before I could catch my breath.
	Loud, pounding melodies that were meant to be sweet and slow, or fast, feverish classical pieces that I butchered until they were unrecognizable even to my ears. I pushed my fingers into aching numbness. My back stiff and my neck pained. Still I ferociously attacked the piano until I was sweating and exhausted.
	Finally, out of breath, I slumped back and dropped my hands to my lap.
	“Frustrated?” a gravelly voice came from behind me.
	I screamed in response, completely surprised. I whirled around on the bench, the smooth wood making it easy to spin around and face Ryder. 
	“What are you doing here?” I gasped. My heart still beat frantically in my chest and my hands flew to my hair which I knew was disheveled and frizzy. 
	“Looking for you,” he said simply. His eyes swept over me with something hidden in them. He made me nervous. There was something different about him today, even from last night. Something I couldn’t place. Like he was lighter today, weighed less or something. But not in pounds… like he wasn’t tied down to gravity today, like he would just float away at any given moment. 
	And at the same time he was more intense, more…. intent with me. 
	“So you had to scare the bejeezus out of me?” I demanded. I slipped my hands under my thighs and rocked forward so that my hair covered my flushed face. 
	“I didn’t mean to scare you, Ivy,” he said patiently. “Sorry. It’s not like I snuck up on you or anything, you were just making a lot of noise.”
	I laughed a little hysterically. And then it turned into more laughter. Good grief, maybe I was the one that was unhinged. 
	Ryder walked over to me and held out his hands. I retrieved mine from under my thighs and slipped them into his and let him pull me up. We were just inches apart when I was standing, our bodies so close together I could feel the heat from his chest and then his minty breath fan over my hairline. 
	“Someone’s here to see you. They’re in the office,” he explained. 
	“Is it my mom?” I asked in a small voice. I could just imagine what she was doing here trying to pull me out of school. And then panic set in, what if she was here to take me to Nix. What if I ran out of chances and last night was the final nail in my coffin? 
	Oh, no. 
	“No, it’s not your mom,” Ryder answered. 
	“Is it Nix?” I whispered, full hysteria setting in. 
	“No, it’s not. I’m not sure who it is. Tanner just caught me in the hall and asked me to find you since you weren’t in class yet.” Ryder must have seen something in my eyes because his grip on my hands tightened. “Ivy, are you okay? Are you expecting someone?”
	“No, I’m not,” I tried to relax. If it wasn’t my mom or Nix, I had no idea who it could be, especially who would come visit me at school. But as long as it wasn’t one of them, I felt a little bit safer. 
	“Ready then?” He asked, although he made no effort to move away from me. 
	“Sure,” I nodded my head and he finally stepped back.
	As we left the still empty music hall, I asked, “How did you know I would be back there?” 
	“I didn’t. I looked everywhere else I could think of first and called your cell. I actually thought maybe you decided to ditch today. But then I remembered you took all that sheet music, so I thought maybe you went to practice, since you weren’t at lunch.” 
	“Oh.”
	“But you weren’t… uh, practicing.” Ryder slanted his gaze at me, taking me in, all of me in, in just a quick sweeping gesture, but still my skin felt hot from his attention.
	“No, I forgot about the sheet music, honestly. I was, um, it’s like therapy,” I admitted. “I was expressing some frustrations.”
	“No kidding,” Ryder chuckled. “I hope they’re not all about the band. Because we’ll take this slow. I don’t expect you to play next week. And seriously, Ivy, you don’t have to do it if you don’t want to.”
	“No, I want to,” I was surprised by my own conviction. My mom would kill me if she knew I was in Ryder’s band. It was okay to spend time with any kind of boy. And technically it was okay to go to concerts, although my mother might have disapproved of what I wore. But it was in no way okay to associate myself with a boy band. Or any kind of band. My talents were strictly cultivated to enhance my beauty and nothing more.
	Gag.
	“I want you to, too,” Ryder admitted. 
	“Hey are you alright?” I asked, intuition niggling in my stomach.
	“Why wouldn’t I be alright?” Ryder asked softly. 
	“I don’t know,” I admitted with honest humor. “I just had this feeling that you needed to talk. But maybe I was wrong.”
	Ryder stopped in front of the office door and turned around to look at me. He ran a hand through his hair but paused half way through with his elbow suspended straight up in the air and his head dipped as if he were deep in thought.
	“Maybe I do need to talk,” he started and I could tell he was nervous. 
	“Okay,” I whispered, probably more nervous than him.
	“Um, okay,” Ryder took a deep breath, and then blew it out slowly. “Kenna and I, we, uh-”
	“Ivy, get in here,” Mrs. Tanner’s shrill voice broke through the spell Ryder placed on me. “They are waiting for you! What on Earth are you doing out here? Ryder Sutton, get to class right now before I write you up.”
	“Yes, ma’am,” Ryder smiled dutifully, gave Mrs. Tanner a playful salute and then squeezed my bicep before leaving me alone with the wicked witch of the west. 
	“Principal Costas is waiting for you in his office,” Mrs. Tanner explained with as much disgust and impatience as any one human being was capable of. 
	“Thanks, T-dog.” Not because I thought I was clever, only because it would annoy the ever living hell out of her and that was one of my main goals in life. 
	“And Ivy?” Mrs. Tanner called right before I reached Principal’s Costas’s office door.
	“Ryder’s a good kid, with a strong future ahead of him. He doesn’t need the likes of you poisoning his life.” When I remained calm and still, she pressed, “Do you understand?”
	“More than you know,” I mumbled, feeling the poison she referred to spreading from my heart to every living part of me.
	She made a feminine grunting sound but didn’t push the issue further. So I raised my hand and knocked on the Principal’s door. Antonio Costas was one of the youngest principals in Omaha. Early thirties with a young family and a reputation for being a hard-ass with heart, the parents of Central adored him. 
	He in turn, being male and notwithstanding Ryder’s super powers, adored me. Where other students were asked to face their consequences head on, or make mature choices, I was disciplined with swats on the hand and threats to call my mother that he never followed through with. 
	Not that he minded calling my mother. Please, he was male after all. And she was…. my mother. But I tried to spare him the embarrassment of groveling at her feet since he had snot nosed toddlers and a high school sweetheart waiting for him at home every night. 
	Not that he was an unfaithful man. It wasn’t his fault. 
	He was actually a really good guy and because I couldn’t blame him for his reaction to my mom or me, I respected him.
	Principal Costas opened the door and greeted me with a huge smile. “Hi, Ivy, I’m glad you could finally join us.” 
	“Thanks,” I returned the smile. My eyes fell immediately to the guest in his office, a woman I didn’t know. 
	I followed Principal Costas into the office and swallowed back a lump of nerves when he closed the door behind him. He was a good looking guy for a teacher, young, in shape with tanned, olive skin by birth. But his most attractive feature was the confident happiness he evoked. He was always pleasant and kind, but there was an air about him that made you certain you never wanted to disappoint him. 
	Principal Costas gestured to the remaining vacant chair in his dated, but well-maintained office. I sat down next to the mystery woman and shot her an uncertain glance.
	“Ivy, I’d like you to meet Mallory Hunter,” Costas explained. 
	I smiled at the attractive blonde in her early thirties. She was wearing a sharp, black skirt suit and screamed polished hard-ass. Her returning smile was tight, but there was a soft pity about her expression I didn’t entirely understand. 
	“Ms. Hunter is a lawyer on behalf of your father’s estate, as I understand,” Costas explained. “Smith Porter called earlier this morning to arrange this meeting. I am going to give you time to…. talk.” 
	Principal Costas put a reassuring hand on my shoulder and then left his office quietly. I gulped back some awkward nervousness and then shifted so I could face Mallory Hunter head on. 
	“Hi, Ivy,” she greeted soothingly. She held a folder in her lap, and there was an expensive brief case at her feet. 
	“Hi,” I said simply and then curiosity got the better of me. “Do you work for Jared?” Jared T. Artero was the lawyer in charge of my father’s estate and my trust. We talked every year around Christmas time because he was my father’s friend as well as legal advisor and he liked to make sure I was okay. I looked forward to talking to him because I liked to make sure my money was okay.
	“Not exactly,” she smiled brighter and I could see that it was her method of placating me. “I’m here on behalf of Smith Porter. Actually I work for the sister firm of Arnold, Terkoff and Blane. My firm is Hastle and Crimmens, but Catarina Arnold is my mentor.”
	“Okay, so I’m really confused,” I grimaced. What did she just say?
	“Catarina Arnold is employed by Mr. Porter, she is also my boss. Well, indirectly. As I understand this, your situation is very… precarious. Smith brought me in to ensure nothing could be directly linked back to him, Catarina or Jared.”
	“Ah.” Well, Okay, that made sense. And if my mom ever started asking questions I would just have Mallory recite that entire jumble of words. She would be confused immediately.
	“I’ve met you here, because I understand your home life is intense?” Mallory had this way of punching her point. She would pause dramatically and then say her point with enthusiastic curiosity. I bet her tactic worked well with indecisive juries. “Smith has expressed concern that you might be facing abuse. As you know if you are in verifiable danger, it is possible for you to acquire the full amount of your trust early. Verifiable danger can be defined as any kind of abuse, emotional, physical or verbal with recorded evidence or life-threatening circumstances that you are capable of involving the police or FBI in. Can you claim either of these conditions?”
	My mother slapping me flew to the forefront of my mind, but then again it wasn’t that awful. It was just a slap. It wasn’t like I had to be rushed to the emergency room or anything. The mark was completely gone by morning, no evidence or scars left behind. What did verbal abuse even mean? My mother was harsh at times, callous and unfeeling always, but was that actual abuse? Had I suffered anything that could be proven in the court of law other than a messed up sense of reality and unrealistic expectations? 
	“I don’t have anything I can prove,” I finally admitted. “I’m not even sure Smith is entirely justified in involving you. There’s no abuse happening in my life.” 
	Not yet anyway. And by that time I’ll be eighteen, I’ll be an adult. So it won’t matter. 
	“I was afraid of this,” Mallory’s face filled with more pity. “Smith and Catarina are very good friends of mine. I’ve taken this case as a favor to them. And I’m working with Jared, who seems to share some of the same concerns as Smith. Unlike Smith, Jared respects your mother, thinks the world of her actually, but he has shared some of your father’s dying words and I understand why Jared feels the way he does.”
	My father’s dying words? What did that mean?
	I opened my mouth to ask, but she continued. “There might not be anything to share with me now. There might never be. But I don’t think Smith would have gone to all these lengths if there wasn’t something going on.”
	After several moments of charged silence I finally settled on, “You’re right. I can’t prove anything, but I need my trust early. I need it now.”
	“Alright, then that’s what we will work on. I won’t call you, or contact you in any way other than here at school. And I’ll visit again in a month. If you can record anything you think is useful on your phone. Or if anything happens take a picture of it immediately. If conditions worsen for you, get ahold of Smith as soon as possible. Does that work for you?” She raked her eyes over me in a way that screamed I was her client and nothing else. Pity maybe? But there was no sympathy behind Mallory Hunter’s expression.
	Still, it was obvious she kicked ass in court. 
	“Yes, that works for me,” I agreed feeling like I was signing away something very precious. Like my soul.
	Which was ridiculous. If anything, staying was so much worse than leaving for that same thing. 
	“Alright, then. Ivy, thank you for your time. I’ll be in touch,” she stood then and stretched out her hand. I echoed every movement and then bit back a smile at her firm handshake. 
	She was just so…. professional. 
	“Thank you, Mallory,” I gushed not meaning to. I actually meant to return the professional air of civility, but suddenly I found myself near tears. Partly because Smith had disregarded everything I said. But mostly because there was hope that I hadn’t felt in a really long time. Hope I hadn’t felt in maybe ever.

Chapter Twenty-Eight

	Three pounds my ass. Literally… maybe that’s where the three pounds were hiding. But I honestly gave losing them a legitimate run for two full days. And nothing happened. Not even a half of pound. Not even after I peed first thing in the morning. 
	Now that it was Saturday and I was practically faint from hunger I decided to screw it. Okay, so two days didn’t exactly equal the strongest effort ever, but chocolate croissants were calling to me from across the street. Fresh, warm, gooey ones. With a caramel macchiato to drink. 
	I could always start again tomorrow. Right? Right.
	I rushed through a shower, only shaving my calves and ankles, leaving my thighs for a different day. Small rebellion, but well worth it. I blow dried my hair, hot rolled, then brushed it out to erase all previous efforts and painted my face with the usual regimen of makeup. My mom wasn’t going to wake up this morning and do a leg check on my dedication to shaving, but she for sure would check out my face in one second flat if I didn’t take cautious care. And if I intended to sneak out for chocolate croissants I needed to be extra careful. 
	After the beauty routine, I dressed in a pair of turquoise skinny jeans, white scooped neck tank top and a sheer oversized white cardigan. I slipped into some red wedges and threw on the required amount of jewelry to complete the overdressed outfit. But bases covered and I was ready to go. 
	As long as I didn’t spill chocolate on my shirt, I would probably get away with this too. 
	Mom hadn’t talked to me since she shut me up by slapping me across the face. So… I had that going for me.
	I slipped out of the apartment and across Farnam without incident.  Once I gained some distance from my happy home, I found myself breathing easier, taking in the crisp coolness of the late October morning, and even smiling a little. 
	This morning felt like a reprieve from everything, from my mom, from Nix, from school, from… me. That same everything felt easy. And for a moment I forgot about it all and just looked forward to breakfast. 
	Until, I opened the door and saw him waiting for me next to the counter. 
	Ryder. 
	And then nothing felt easy.
	Not even breathing.
	He stood with his hip leaning against the counter, in casual conversation with another one of the college girls that worked here. He turned back to smile at me, as if expecting me any moment and then winked. He was dressed in the nicest jeans I had seen him wear, boot cut and dark washed and his black button up shirt was rolled to the elbows. His hair was in all its voluminous, coarse, in-desperate-need-of-industrial-strength-conditioner glory.
	The butterfly in my stomach must have mated sometime during the last thirty seconds because suddenly there was a storm of them viciously attacking my insides. Nervous energy rushed through my body, completely disorienting me. My brain went all fuzzy, like everything intelligent and coherent was suddenly abducted by aliens. My fingers actually started to tremble, like I had a crack addiction and I was jonesing for a hit and my lips adapted a will of their own and curved into a smile without my permission. Actually, completely against my direct orders!
	I was a mess. And a puddle of goo. And a nervous wreck all at the same time! 
	Was this honestly what it was like to have a crush on a boy? 
	Because if so I hated being a girl.
	And loved it at the same time. 
	Good grief, this was confusing. Now to round this multi-personality-riddled problem out, I just needed to act cool and not trip face-first over my feet. 
	No problem.
	“Morning, Red,” he greeted with a deep, rough voice that hadn’t recovered from sleep yet.
	“Good morning,” I replied politely, faltering a little on my way to the cash register.
	“I was hoping to catch you here,” he admitted, and his mouth curved up into a reserved smile.
	“Yeah?” 
	“Yeah,” he echoed and then turned to his friend working. “She’ll have a caramel macchiato, extra hot. And I’m ready for my order too now. Thanks Gwen.”
	I finally made it to the counter and contemplated forgetting the croissants altogether with how sweet Ryder was being, but then my stomach growled loudly and I knew I needed to eat something. 
	“Hungry?” he turned to face me, and crossed his arms against his chest. The movement pulled his shirt tight at his biceps and shoulders and I had the strongest urge to run my fingers against the creases in the fabric and smooth them out. 
	“Mmm-hmmm. I could eat like five croissants this morning.” 
	“Good to know,” Ryder’s face broke out into a bigger grin, his gray eyes sparkling until they turned into shiny silver. “But I have a better idea.”
	“Than chocolate croissants? You can see why I would have my doubts,” I took another step forward so I could press my hands against the cool glass of the counter and lean forward. I looked back at Ryder over my shoulder, noting how close we were. I was having fun flirting with him, I could admit that. But I also had to admit I needed to stop myself soon. It wouldn’t do any good for him to actually start returning these feelings. 
	“Come have breakfast at my house,” his voice dropped to a rumbling timber.
	For a few moments I was stunned into silence, only the sound of the espresso machine whirring in the background, the soft tickling of ceramic dishes being used and melodic hum of conversational voices interrupted the shock that froze all of my thoughts. 
	“I can’t,” I mumbled finally. I dropped my gaze to the counter, to my hands, to the cash register, to anywhere but Ryder’s face.
	“Yes, you can,” he pleaded gently. Always gently with me. Always careful. 
	I shook my head quickly. “No, thanks, it’s sweet of you to offer.”
	“It’s not sweet of me to offer,” Ryder laughed harshly. “It’s against my better judgment to offer. But come anyway.”
	“Well, now you’ve convinced me,” I groaned. A moment ago my thoughts were all vibrating and fuzzy with confusion, but leave it up to Ryder to bring me right back to reality. 
	“Here you go,” Gwen interrupted Ryder’s ready response. She handed Ryder a drink carrier full of four large coffee cups. The scent of fresh, hot caffeine permeated the air around me and I instantly took a step forward to inhale a good whiff. 
	Ryder slid a twenty and a five across the counter and winked at Gwen. 
	“This is way too much,” she smiled at him. 
	I forced my expression to remain the same and hide the jealous monster that lurked just beneath my calm surface. 
	“I know,” he shrugged. “Think of it like a bribe. I’m holding her,” he gestured to me with his elbow, “coffee hostage. If she decides not to come with me, do not serve her under any circumstances. We clear?”
	“Sure,” Gwen laughed. “We’re clear.” 
	My mouth dropped open in surprise and I shot Gwen an imploring look. She looked me over, not in a very kind way and her expression became steel. 
	“Are you serious?” I gasped more to Ryder than to Gwen, but she shrugged her shoulder as if there was nothing she could do. “Ryder, make her serve me coffee.” I whispered harshly when he started to walk away and Gwen disappeared through the door that led to the kitchen. “Ryder!”
	“Not a chance, Red. If you want this delicious, amazing-smelling macchiato, you better move your ass.” He didn’t slow down and soon he was out the door while I stayed staring after him.
	I decided he was right, so I hurried after him and my kidnapped coffee. “You know, I could always just go to Starbucks if I get desperate.” 
	Empty threat. 
	“Yep, you could,” he admitted, but didn’t look back at me.
	I let out a long suffering sigh, but in the end I let myself in the passenger side of his Bronco parked on the street. He handed me the carton of coffees, shot me a huge grin and then started the car. 
	I held the coffee in my lap with both hands and tried not to move one way or the other when his arm rested on the back of my seat, just above my shoulder blades while he backed out. There was warmth in that movement that I was almost desperate to lean into and at the same time the clawing need had me eyeing the door handle and contemplating my chances of diving out of the car before he could put it in drive.
	In the end I just remained still- absolutely still.
	When the Bronco faced east on Farnam he removed his hand from across the seat to deal with the gearshift and I released the breath that had been bottled up inside me.  
	We were quiet on the way to Ryder’s house. Just the sounds of the radio, top forty surprisingly, and Ryder’s soft humming filled the car. I glanced over at him several times but his eyes were focused on the road and his jaw didn’t give anything away, except maybe he felt more relaxed than I did.
	Ryder parked parallel from his building and then shut the car off. He stayed still for a few moments while the engine wound down and I didn’t dare move from the car before he did. 
	“Hungry?” he finally asked, tilting his cocky grin to face me.
	“Do I have a choice?” I grunted, working up my best martyred-victim-expression.
	“It’s going to be good, I promise. But before we go in, I wanted to warn you that my uncle and dad will be there,” his grin faltered, leaving behind some nervous embarrassment I didn’t quite understand. 
	“You kidnapped me to meet your family?” I bit out, suddenly furious. “Ryder, what the hell is Kenna going to say? What is your dad going to say? This is so weird. You should have asked me first.”
	I counted the four coffees before we left the café, but some part of me held out hope they were just extras. And I had been so blindsided by his desire to take me with him that I hadn’t really thought through what breakfast with his family meant.
	“Probably I should have asked you first,” he shrugged off whatever embarrassment was there before and replaced his expression with a determination that sucked the breath from my lungs, “but you wouldn’t have come. And Kenna won’t care that you came for breakfast. Promise. We’re friends Ivy. Stop reading into everything I do. I just want to be your friend.” 
	I thought over everything he said and convinced myself he was right. Friends. We were friends. But then a thought flashed through my resolve and I blurted out, “Your dad and your uncle! I mean, I have this effect on… uh, parents. Parents really love me. It’s just this talent I’ve always had. Actually with all adults. So um, if your dad seems to really like me, then you should know it’s just my natural charm.”
	I wanted to smack my hand against my forehead and groan, but I smiled instead. 
	“Natural charm?” Ryder laughed. “Yeah, you’re really oozing with it.” He rolled his eyes but then shot me an encouraging smile. “There’s no need to be nervous, Ivy. My dad likes everybody.” 
	I grimaced. “I swear, I’m not nervous. I just want you to be….” I coughed, trying to get the ridiculous words out, “aware of my… parental charm.” 
	“Sure, I’m aware,” Ryder chuckled and unclipped his seatbelt, “of your parental charm. Tanner gushes about it all the time.”
	A laugh bubbled up in me before I could stop it by pretending to be offended. “Fine,” I sighed and unbuckled too. “But don’t say I didn’t warn you.”

Chapter Twenty-Nine

We met on the driver’s side of the car and walked across the street together. He led me around the building and punched in the code for his door. Holding it open, his hand landed on the small of my back when I walked by. A shiver rippled through me at his touch, but I ignored it.  
	At the top of the stairs, I waited for him to open the door again and then inhaled deeply at the heavy scent of bacon frying and bread baking. Deep, rumbling male laughter filled the air and paused at the sound of the door. 
	I walked in and turned to the kitchen to meet Ryder’s dad and uncle. There was at least twenty years between them, but the resemblance was obvious. Ryder’s dad, the older of the two, was very cool-professor with gelled hair, turned up into messy spikes and thick, black hipster glasses. He was classically handsome though too, with the same chiseled jaw line as Ryder and those silver-gray eyes that could be so unnerving. Ryder’s uncle Matt, seemed sandwiched between Ryder and his dad in the timeline of the Sutton Male Lifespan. I pictured the evolutionary timeline with Ryder representing the primitive ape and Ryder’s dad the full grown man. Matt fit somewhere in the middle of hunched over primate with less hair and elongated thumbs. 
	Matt slouched over the stove, hip pressed against the counter, wooden spoon in long, slender fingers. He had extremely messy bed head hair, long to his chin and sticking out in every way. He was wearing glasses too, but they were thinner framed and did even less to conceal the flash of silver behind them. His face was covered in several day stubble and his worn white t-shirt and sweatpants revealed the same broad-shouldered, narrow-waist build Ryder carried.
	“Ryder, is this your friend?” his dad asked from the kitchen. He smiled over at us and then took a sip of his orange juice while he waited for Ryder to respond. 
	“Yep,” Ryder nudged me forward and I found myself walking to the kitchen counter and setting the coffees down. “Dad, Matty, this is Ivy Pierce. Ivy, this is my uncle Matt, and my dad, Dr. Nathan Sutton.” 
	“Nate is just fine,” he laughed at his son and then extended his hand beyond his breakfast glass.
	I took a few steps forward and accepted his hand shake. He had a strong but friendly grip and his eyes still twinkled from laughter. I sucked in a breath and met his gaze, but nothing except openness seemed to look back at me. No lust. No desire. No unwelcomed interest. 
	Whew. “Hi, Nate,” my voice trembled beneath nerves and I prayed no one else noticed. 
	“We’ve heard a lot about you, Ivy,” Matt called from next to the stove and I turned to meet his outstretched hand.
	“Oh, no,” I groaned dramatically. 
	“All good things of course,” Matt was quick to reassure. I took his hand, and he shook it but his eyes were fixed behind me for a long moment before they flickered down to meet mine. He cleared his throat and something changed in his expression before he quickly added, “It’s always nice to meet one of Ryder’s friends.”
	I stopped, but just barely, from rolling my eyes. 
	“It’s nice to meet you too,” I said politely.
	Ryder clapped a hand on my shoulder and pulled me out of the kitchen a little bit. “Alright, let’s let Uncle Matt get back to breakfast before he burns everything.” Matt waved an annoyed spatula in the air, but winked at me before turning back to the stove. Ryder leaned in closer and spoke with a softer tone, “Grab your coffee.”
	And then he reached around me so that his arm slid across my side and the weight of his chest pressed into my back. I froze. He plucked his coffee from the carrier all the while I counted the places our bodies connected and then he was gone, along with his warmth. I cleared my throat and focused harder on the three remaining cups trying to decipher which one was mine. 
	“Could this be it?” his dad reached forward and picked up one that had “macchiato” scrawled across the top. 
	I looked up at him a bit dumbfounded but managed a small nod. He handed me my cup and I quickly turned around to hide my deep blush from him. 
	Ryder stood over the keyboard, messing around with the melody to the song he wanted me to play with him, so I assumed breakfast also meant practice. That was fine with me. As long as I had a reason, any reason, not to obsess over my feelings for Ryder or analyze every stupid move, touch or word he was responsible for, I could survive this morning. 
	“You’re still set on making me join the band?” I asked through gritted teeth. 
	“Absolutely,” he grunted, not even a little bit amused with me. He moved out of the way so I could take my place behind the keys and then took my coffee from me. I let it go with heavy regret and watched him set it down on a bent back music stand. “Besides, I think you’re pretty face on stage will help draw a bigger crowd.”
	“You have no idea,” I mumbled. I wondered if Ryder was serious, if he really thought I would. A defeated feeling settled over me and I felt deflated…. lost and alone again. He hadn’t meant to, but his words were a cold dose of reality. 
	“That’s it,” Ryder snapped his fingers in front of me. His tone suddenly stern frustration and I glanced up just in time to see his eyes flash with anger. “We’re going to have a talk later, Ivy. I’m not doing this anymore.”
	“Doing what?” I gasped. His words were spoken quietly and for my ears only, but his tone was unmistakably cold. 
	“My dad and uncle are staring over here,” he whispered fiercely. “At you,” he finished on a snarl in case I didn’t already assume that was what he meant.
	“So?” I forced myself to remain casual.
	“I’m not playing games anymore. I want to know what’s going on.”
	“Nothing is going on,” I sighed and then pretended to be confused. “You’re scaring me.”
	That was my go-to self-preservation phrase. I had a perfect success rate with that. Decent guys never wanted to be the reason for female distress. And Ryder was probably the most decent guy I knew.
	My tone was all bored confusion, but only because that was how I had been taught to behave. On the inside my heartbeat pulsed in my ears, loud and banging, and my breath whooshed in and out like a vacuum. Ryder’s gray eyes were granite and steel with determination and a huge part of me didn’t believe I could get out of explaining it this time. 
	And the other small part of me didn’t want to get out of it.
	I wanted to tell Ryder my secrets. 
	I wanted him to know me.
	“Do not play games with me, Ivy,” Ryder growled, low and rough. And then he softened, his eyes almost pleading, “You can trust me.” 
	I held his gaze and panicked. Honestly I couldn’t trust anybody with my secret, not even him. But that wasn’t the point since it didn’t matter if I could… I wanted to trust him. I wanted to let him in. And that terrified me. Tearing my eyes away from Ryder, my fingers moved against the keys but they pounded out loudly in the now quiet loft, so I paused to adjust the volume with shaking fingers. The music, now barely above a whisper, seemed easier today and my fingers moved to the haunting melody Ryder composed.
	“You sound better today,” Ryder admitted in a more normal tone. “Do you feel more comfortable with an audience now?”
	“I feel more comfortable with the keyboard,” I explained, ignoring his small jab. 
	“Do you think you can keep the melody strong if I start playing along? Or is that going to mess you up?” Ryder asked with a sweetness that had been absent not just two minutes ago. 
	I shrugged a shoulder but stayed focused on the sheet music in front of me as my right hand soared upward and heightened emotionally(or would have if the keyboard weren’t so inflexible) while my left hand harmonized in chords. 
	From my peripheral I watched Ryder walk over and pick up his guitar. He slung it over his shoulder and immediately his fingers found home on the used guitar strings. He plucked out a few tuning issues that I did my best not to pay attention to and then walked over to me with a silly grin on his face. 
	He looked over my shoulder and studied my music for a long time before strumming out a chord that fit exactly right. And then he was off into the lead guitar piece that clouded all of my concentration and forced me to ignore him completely just so I could remember middle C. 
	We actually started to make music together. After the other night and my obvious failures this felt kind of…. nice. Ryder, the talented rock star, covered my mistakes easily. But I was starting to make fewer mistakes anyway. 
	I had natural talent in all things musical, but any accomplishments on the piano were achieved by hard work and tons of practice. So even though this wasn’t more than complicated harmonies, I still had to work at it. And I had never played with anyone else before. 
	After about fifteen minutes and the fourth time through the song, we actually started to sound really good together. Plus, I could hear the guitar a bit better, and because I was familiar with the song I was taking over on my own. This felt awesome. 
	“Alright Simon, Garfunkel, time to break for breakfast,” Matt called out from the kitchen. 
	Ryder smiled at me over his guitar, “That sounds good.” 
	“Yes, it does,” I admitted. 
	I stood back from the keyboard and grabbed my now cold coffee while Ryder set his guitar down and slipped his black pick into a pouch filled with others of all different colors. I hesitated long enough so Ryder could lead the way to the big concrete table where a huge spread of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, rolls, gravy and bowl of fruit were laid out. 
	“Wow,” I admired. “This looks incredible.” 
	“Thanks,” Matt beamed. 
	I sat down next to Ryder, and then accepted the frying pan filled with eggs from his dad. He had to stand up and reach across the table to give it to me and I had to do the same. I accepted the weight of the heavy pan and immediately added some to my plate before passing it to Ryder. 
	Ryder looked at me for a moment, hands filled with hot frying pan and serving spoon, before he dug a huge spoonful out and added it to my plate. My mouth gaped open with chagrin and I whipped my head around to say something about women’s rights and knowing my own body but he wasn’t looking at me and I didn’t want to make a scene in front of his dad and uncle. 
	The food continued to be passed around and soon my plate was heaping with homemade goodies. I had never even had biscuits and gravy before. I’d seen it on other people’s plates, but you can eat a great breakfast without ever being subjected to that kind of greasy calorie fest. I would have passed on it altogether, but Ryder lifted a ladle full of gravy to dump all over my plate, eggs, bacon and all, so I took back the spoon and added it myself. Now the thick, white gravy was mixing with my fresh cut cantaloupe and pineapple and I wasn’t sure exactly what to do.
	“So Ivy, tell us a little about yourself,” Ryder’s dad, Nate, asked from over a fork full of eggs.
	I felt the attention of everyone in the room like a blinding spotlight. I hated questions like this, and Ryder stayed so still and quiet next to me I realized he was just as interested in what I was going to say as his dad. If not more interested…. he was no help at all. 
	“Um, I’m not sure what to say,” I admitted. “I go to school with Ryder at um, Central. And I’m a junior…. I’ve never had a breakfast like this before, it’s really incredible. I can’t believe you eat like this every Saturday.”
	Deflecting the attention from myself to the food worked and everyone laughed at the insane amount of food on the table.
	“Well, it’s not always like this,” Matt spoke up. “Ryder begged for the works this morning. I think he was trying to make a good impression.” 
	Ryder jerked at his uncle’s words and gave me a sheepish, embarrassed smile, “I just wanted to make sure there was something you liked. It wasn’t a big deal.”
	“Oh, no it wasn’t a big deal,” Matt covered, realizing he had said something that made Ryder and me uncomfortable. “I’m just giving Ryder a hard time.” His easy grin was one I had seen on Ryder’s face probably a hundred times in our short friendship and I didn’t even think about it, I just returned it.
	Nate cut back in, probably hoping to take the awkward attention off his son, “So you play the piano well, Ivy. Are your parents musical?” 
	“It’s just my mom,” I offered casually. “And she does play. It’s kind of a tradition in our family. She made me start when I was really young.”
	“That’s great,” Nate nodded along. “I always appreciate when a parent takes solid interest in their children’s musical educations. She probably loves the band then? A practical use for all that talent, it’s got to make her proud.” 
	Unease filtered over my skin and I dropped my eyes to the plate of food I hardly touched. “Actually, my mom doesn’t really understand anything but the classics. I was classically trained with Bach and Mozart, she hates anything composed beyond the nineteenth century, save maybe for Sibelius.”
	“Really?” Nate practically choked on his breakfast. “So she never let you play anything jazz? Blues? Contemporary?”
	I hid a smile and shook my head. “Nothing current. And especially nothing jazz.”
	“Just for the piano though, right?” Nate pressed and he seemed more like Ryder than ever before. “You’ve heard Gershwin? Duke Ellington?”
	I gave him a blank look although I had heard the names before and his entire body sagged with the news. Ryder chuckled next to me and put a reassuring hand on my knee under the table. My heart started pounding double time at the small contact, but he simply squeezed my knee cap and then removed his hand like it was no big deal. Because it wasn’t a big deal- at all.
	“You’ll have to forgive my brother,” Matt interrupted. “He’s a bit of a fanatic when it comes to contemporary music.”
	“No kidding,” Ryder groaned. 
	All three men broke out into big smiles then. I shot Ryder a questioning look and he rolled his eyes before explaining, “I’m named after a Van Morrison song.” 
	“Oh,” I said like that explained everything. “What song?”
	“Rough God Goes Riding,” Ryder tried to pretend like the song was annoying, but I caught the reverent tone to his voice as he spoke the title carefully.
	“I’ve never heard of it,” I confessed. 
	“But you’ve heard of Van Morrison before, yeah?” Nate asked while his hands gripped at the table nervously.
	“I mean sure,” I laughed at his reaction, “I’ve heard the name before.” Even though I didn’t even know if Van Morrison was one man or a full band. 
	Nate winced dramatically. And Matt burst into good natured laughter. “It’s alright, big brother. Look, Ivy’s managed to escape the regurgitated pop bullshit culture her whole life and she seems to have turned out just fine.”
	I turned to Ryder for some clarification. “Where my father obsesses over everything current and cool to the point he can karaoke to Gaga, my uncle shuns society as the harrying work of the devil,” Ryder paused dramatically and then finished with, “Except Tarantino films. We all find common ground with Tarantino.”
	“Well, that’s the good Lord’s work, right there,” Matt grunted in approval and then shot me another wink. 	
	“And I don’t obsess,” Nate defended. “I am just fascinated by the constant evolution of society. Music is continuously changing, growing…. moving, even if some think backwards. Human creativity is so interesting. And take your mother and me for a moment, how different our tastes are, our values. There is something in that, something worth studying.” 
	I sat spellbound, loving every word as it fell out of his mouth. He was so opposite of my world, so different and rebellious from anything I had been taught. In the circle you like the same thing everyone else likes, the same thing everyone else has liked forever. There are no individual opinions or tastes, there’s just what we always did, what was expected of us, what was commanded of us. Nix decided. Or our mothers decreed.
	“I had no idea these guys were such hippies, I swear,” Ryder laughed and then pushed away from his plate. His arm went around the back of my chair and his fingers tapped out an unheard rhythm against the metal. 
	“Don’t let him fool you, Ivy,” Nate’s silver eyes twinkled at me from behind his glasses. “He’s proud of his old man.” 
	“Yeah, yeah,” Ryder rolled his eyes. “Now please enough questions. I brought Ivy here to eat, let her eat.” 
	Nate and Matt grinned at each other sharing some secret that didn’t need to be said out loud. I chose to ignore them and Ryder’s hand as his fingers accidentally brushed across the top of my shoulder. I looked down at my plate and dug in.
	Everything was amazing. I sighed happily as I shoveled the food into my mouth, not caring if I looked like a pig. My mother would have been so proud.
	Or probably the opposite of proud. 
	Nate and Matt included Ryder in their conversation that seemed to jump all over the place without any clear direction. They talked about Matt’s classes this semester and I learned that he was older than most to be going to traditional university. But he had spent four years after high school traveling the world and then another two years after that working in Colorado just so he could afford to have a place to sleep, eat and snowboard as often as he wanted to. He finally moved here when Nate accepted the position at UNO and decided to start taking his life seriously. This was all shared in casual clips and phrases that I pieced together myself. I also learned that Ryder’s dad not only taught music but also shared his love for soccer and he and Matt played in an indoor league together. Nate hated Omaha in the winter, but loved it summer through fall. He was disgustingly proud of both his brother and his son and had long ago decided that wherever Ryder wanted to go to college, he would just apply for a job there to both take care of tuition and stay close to Ryder. There was also a healthy mix of politics, upcoming plans for the week and a discussion about Batman versus Iron Man weaved in. 
	By the time Matt stood up to start clearing the plates, I had never laughed so hard in my life. I hopped up to help with the dishes, but Ryder reached for my hand and tugged me back down. I landed half off my chair, my legs pressed into Ryder’s, his hand still gripping mine. 
	“This is always my job,” he explained in a soft voice. “If Matt’s offering, let him do it.” 
	“Okay,” I agreed. This close to Ryder, with so much of our bodies touching, I felt breathless, disoriented. 
	“Do you have time for a walk?” he asked, his thumb brushed a line across the palm of my hand and his knee pressed harder against my thigh. I felt slightly jostled as his knee bounced furiously up and down, connected so tightly to me. 
	“Yes,” I answered before I bothered looking at the time. 
	A crooked smile broke across his too handsome face and he met my eyes and held them for several moments. Neither of us said anything, or moved, and then everything quieted around us, or at least I felt like it did. The sounds of dishes clinking together in the sink ceased, his father and uncle’s voices faded away and then there was only my breathing and his as our chests lifted and fell in harmony. 
	“Okay, let’s go,” he breathed and then tugged me to my feet. 
	“Okay,” I heard myself say. And then I was following him out the door and ignoring every single rational protest that was screaming inside my head.

Chapter Thirty

	We didn’t walk far, just up the last flight of stairs and to the roof of the building. The concrete roof was flat and littered with gravel. The wind whipped, chilly and crisp across our faces. The sun was bright and warm this morning, in constant battle with the dropping temperatures of autumn. 
	Ryder let go of my hand when we were alone on the roof and walked to the far side. I followed. I didn’t have a choice but to follow. I was in way deeper than I wanted to be- than I should be.
	He turned around once he reached the shoulder-high wall barricade of the brick building. The tall wall kept us from having a great view of downtown but over the top of it I could see the trees from the mall all turned brilliant fall shades of orange and red and yellow and I could see the tops of all the biggest buildings, First National,  the Holland Center, The Double Tree Hotel. 
	“I want to know, Ivy,” Ryder said simply in a way that seemed relaxed but sincere.
	Tears pricked my eyes immediately. Whatever I said about Ryder, whatever I wanted to believe…. I liked his friendship, I valued it. And I liked him. This conversation was the beginning of the end. The death of everything beautiful between us.
	“No you don’t,” I whispered. “I promise you, you don’t.” 
	“Tell me,” he demanded, taking a step forward and gripping my hands in his. 
	“Tell you what?” I turned my head, afraid to meet his eyes.
	“Ivy, don’t,” his voice grated against my heartstrings, rough and violent, demanding and authoritative. And it was like my entire being responded to him, like my soul sat up straight and my blood buzzed attentively in my veins. He pulled at me. 
	And that terrified me. 
	“Ryder I can’t… there is nothing to tell,” I argued. 
	He took a step forward. “I want to help you. I want to be your friend, but you have to let me.” 
	This did not feel like friendship.
	I turned my head away and avoided his eyes some more. This tactic wasn’t really working, but I wasn’t strong enough to leave him, so it would have to do. 
	“Okay, then start with Sam. Will you tell me about Sam?” That damn voice. I regretfully looked up and the soft, pleading tone of his voice trapped me. Paralyzed me. And then bewitched me. “Please, Ivy. Help me understand.” 
	I hesitated for as long as I could, for an entire two minutes, and then I caved, “Sam Evans… we dated last year. He was a senior and I was a sophomore. But, um, he was on the basketball team and I was kind of working my way through dating them all.” A blush flooded my face and for the first time what my life represented and the expectations Nix and my mother had for me humiliated me.
	“Ivy, it’s okay, you can trust me,” he swore in a way that I had no choice but to believe him. 
	I pulled some courage from places I didn’t think I had, and cleared my throat. “By the time Sam and I started dating, I had already been through the point guard, the center and some of the second string. I was tired of dating…. tired of, just tired of it all. And I really liked Sam. He was nicer than some of the other guys, more laid back. He didn’t… he wasn’t always pushing me.” I cleared my throat again; a little surprised I admitted that much. I couldn’t bear to look at Ryder, I was too embarrassed but I felt his body tense until he was rigid and every muscle was hard. “Um, anyway, Sam and I clicked in a way that I hadn’t ever clicked with anybody before and I don’t know. When it was time to break up with him, I just couldn’t. I liked him, like really liked him. So we dated for a while, almost four months. But things started to get serious and I wasn’t ready for that. He wasn’t really ready for that either, you know? But he thought he was. And then, it was spring and he had this scholarship to play basketball out of state, but he started talking about staying here and giving it up, just to be close to me. I didn’t mean to do that to him, to ruin his life. I just liked being around him, I just wanted a little bit of a break from the constant wannabe date rapists and… I just… For the first time, Sam saw me, really me, not the pretty package I’m wrapped in and I was selfish with that.” A tear slipped down my cheek but I was too wrapped up in the ugly memories to wipe it away. “But I couldn’t let him give up his scholarship. Or stay here for me. He needed to live his life, and he wouldn’t…. couldn’t see that. So I broke up with him. I had to, I mean it was time. But he took it really, really hard. And then we were at this party. We didn’t go together, but we ran into each other there. And he was drunk, like really, really drunk. But when he saw me…. He just broke. I broke him. And then he stormed out of the party, so I chased after him; I mean I couldn’t let him drive like that. But he was bigger than me and I called for help, but everyone there was pretty much toasted. And anyway, I jumped in the car with him, thinking I could, I don’t know, convince him to stop, or pull over or something. But he was pissed, and so…. hurt. He just took off and before I knew it we were on the wrong side of the road going like seventy-five and then…. and the next thing I knew I was in the hospital. I had buckled my seatbelt, but Sam had not. No one else was hurt, he crashed into the median and the car flipped and rolled eventually into a light pole, but it was late enough that there weren’t any other cars on the road. Sam was thrown from the car on the first roll, but the car landed on top of him. He’s in a wheelchair now, and he won’t be able to talk ever again, or walk again. He’ll never be able to play basketball again.” The tears were streaming now, huge, messy rivers of tears that mixed with snot and ran down my face. I wiped at my face with my sleeves and makeup and wetness stained the white fabric. 
	Ryder let me hiccup a sob one time before he pulled me against his chest and wrapped his arms around me. One hand tangled in the back of my hair, pressing my skull against his breastbone, and the other hugged me around the waist so that there was absolutely no space between us. More sobs burst from my lungs, like lava from a volcano and they came in a torrential downpour of emotion I wasn’t prepared for.
	Emotion I promised myself was buried away. 
	“Ivy, what happened to Sam is not your fault. He should never have been driving and he should never have tried to medicate his pain with alcohol. You cannot blame yourself,” Ryder ordered in a hoarse, pained whisper.
	“Yes, I can,” I snapped, the sadness abruptly replaced with anger. “You have no idea. Everything was my fault. Everything.” 
	Ryder pulled away from me and tried to look in my eyes, but I ducked my head away. I was ashamed and ugly with emotion. 
	Finally, he settled on, “Why is it your fault, Ivy?” 
	“Because of who I am!” I screamed at him. I was tired of his calm, placating tone. He couldn’t sooth me, not this. This was pain he couldn’t take away. “Because of what I do! I destroy lives. That’s my whole purpose. Sam, all the boys before him, Chase, you! The crash was my fault. If he never would have met me, he would have been safe!” 
	Ryder met my fierce emotion with his own angered conviction, “Why Ivy? What does his crash have to do with you? What does who you are have to do with any of it?” 
	“It’s crazy,” I let out hysterical laughter that came out rough and course in my winded lungs. “You’ll think I’m crazy.” 
	“I already think you’re crazy,” he admitted and this time my laughter was less crazed and more genuine. 
	“Siren. I’m a, uh, I’m a siren,” the words rushed out of me in a waterfall of truth I would never be able to take back. Ryder let go of my arms and took a step back, completely shocked, or stunned, or… I didn’t know. I couldn’t imagine being told something as crazy as that for the first time. “I told you, I told you that you would think I was crazy. And it is crazy! It’s completely f-ing nuts.” 
	“What do you mean you’re a siren?” Ryder bit through my hysterics with a cold, demanding order. 
	“Greek mythology? Zeus, Mount Olympus? Gods and goddesses, nymphs, muses… sirens? I am a siren,” Sanity started to return to me once the truth was out there. And shockingly my breath came easier and my shoulders straightened out. Whether Ryder ever believed me or not, I felt better knowing I came clean to somebody. “It’s all true, Ryder. All of it. Well, okay, not all of it. Not in the context you read about it at school. And Mount Olympus isn’t like some reference to heaven, it’s just a normal mountain. But the rest of it is somewhat true.” 
	“I don’t understand, Ivy. Is this like, a, uh, uh, metaphor?” It was like he was begging me to say yes, his entire body bent forward, his eyes pleading… he needed me to say yes, that this was all just one big giant metaphor for life and I wasn’t completely insane after all. 
	“No, it’s not a metaphor. Ryder, this is truth. Or at least my truth, what I’ve lived with my whole life. But you have to look at it differently, like it’s not this exaggerated fairy tale that you’re taught in school. The legends are embellished to pander to their egos, but for the most part…. they’re true. And our society, it’s not like it was way back in the day. I mean, there are not that many of us and we all just kind of blend into the rest of humanity now. But, the guys, the attention, Sam’s crash…. It’s because I’m a siren. That’s what I do to men.”
	“Explain it to me slower,” Ryder growled out and I couldn’t tell if he was starting to believe me or not. 
	“Men feel attracted to me because they can’t help it. I’ve been cursed since birth by this…. genealogy. I don’t have a choice about what I do to guys, it just happens. And the more time I spend with any one guy, the deeper the connection for me they feel, the harder it is to get away from. That’s what happened to Sam, he spent too much time with me until I destroyed him and then the crash? That was just like the end of the road with someone like me. The ultimate closure,” I laughed bitterly. 
	“The crash was on purpose?” Ryder gasped, gripping my forearms in his strong hands. 
	“No!” I quickly reassured. “No, it wasn’t on purpose, but it wasn’t necessarily avoidable either. I mean, that kind of stuff hasn’t happened in a really long time. We don’t lure sailors to their graves anymore or anything like that. For the most part, whatever elevated evolution we possessed back in the day is mostly gone by now, but then the crash with Sam happened and my circle, um, my little sect of people like myself look at it like a sign, like a good sign of things to come.” 
	“You want to be able to hurt people?” Ryder’s grip tightened on my arms, and I winced a little. He immediately dropped my arms and turned away like he couldn’t stomach looking at me. I couldn’t let myself hope that he believed me, that he wouldn’t cut off all communication with me after this conversation, but I had to keep talking, I had to make him understand I wasn’t like them.
	“No, not me, I’m not like them. I never wanted to hurt Sam, to hurt anybody. I don’t want this life. But I was born into it. Right now, I don’t have a choice. But I have this trust fund. I’m planning on…. You are planning on going to college, or whatever and I’m, I just have to get out.”
	Ryder let that sink in, his breathing was deep and measured and his eyes smooth silver in thought. Finally he looked up at me, his jawline tensed with some kind of emotion I couldn’t figure out. “Suppose I…. suppose I believe you. Who’s Nix?” 
	“My um, godfather,” I explained but that didn’t really explain anything. 
	“No way, Ivy. The way that guy looks at you, how he acts around you…. it’s like he’s trying to own you. Like you’re his possession. Who is he? You’ve been honest with me this far.” His words cut at me like razor blades, but he was right. I had been honest this far. 
	“In the big perspective he’s Poseidon’s nephew. I wasn’t lying, he really is my godfather. But he’s also my mom’s boss. And he’ll be mine too one day. I mean, if the trust fund plan doesn’t pan out.”
	“And by boss you mean what? What does your mom do?” he questioned me with enough resentment that I wondered if he was starting to get it.
	“My mom, um, all of us, once we reach a certain age are required to work, to contribute to the general fund. We’re raised and groomed to be these perfect women, so that we can use our natural charm to entrap men. Marry them, take their money, destroy their lives or what’s left of them and move on. Or watch them die if we’re really talented and are good at picking them.”
	“And Nix?” Ryder asked again.
	“He’s in charge of it all,” I half shouted in exasperation. “He sets up the meetings, or flies in to assess our work. He controls my mother’s life. And mine. He, he wants me to date you. You’re supposed to be my next… conquest,” I shuddered at the word. “In high school we date for practice, it’s like training. We’re not actually allowed to sleep with anybody, not that I would or anything, but our virginity, it’s like part of our initiation.”
	“Oh, my god,” Ryder spat out with so much hatred and disgust that I cringed. “You’re in the sex slave industry. You’re a goddamn sex slave.” 
	“What?” I shrieked because I hadn’t figured he would jump there that fast. And despite all my truth telling, all the honesty that I spewed like vomit, I still couldn’t admit that fact out loud. It was too ugly, too pathetic. “Didn’t you just hear me? I have to keep my virginity. I’m not like a prostitute or anything.”
	“No you’re not, not yet. Don’t you see how sick this is? How twisted?” And he really did look like he was going to be sick. 
	And it was the look on his face more than his words that finally broke me, “Yes, Ryder! Damn it, of course I do!” I crumpled against the building, pulling my knees to my chest and wrapping my arms around them. I dissolved in to tears again, the weight of everything pressing down so tightly I couldn’t breathe. 
	“Oh, hell, Ivy,” Ryder’s voice cracked and he slid down the wall next to me. He put a solid arm around my back and when I didn’t shrink away he pulled me against him again. 
	I wept into his chest, more ugliness and brokenness than I knew what to do with. When the reality of my life passed, new hysteria broke out at the realization I just included Ryder in my screwed up world. He wasn’t supposed to know any of this and I had all but written him a manual. 
	“Hey, it’s going to be alright, we’re going to get you out of this,” he soothed into my hair, his lips pressed against my head. “My dad can help. We can go to the authorities. Maybe not tell them everything, but enough so that they know you’re in trouble. Child Protective Services can help. We will get you out of this.” 
	My head snapped up, my eyes cleared. I hadn’t thought this through enough to realize Ryder would, of course, want to help. “Ryder, we can’t go to the police, are you crazy? First of all, this is nothing like what you see on TV. This is highly protected and nothing is done illegally. Nix owns several corporations; he’s a world renowned businessman. So the local police aren’t going to be able to find anything dirty on him. And as far as my mom goes, or any of the other women in our circle, by the time they get involved they go willingly. It’s like a cult. I belong to a cult. Only, religion’s not really part of it. Trust me though. I wasn’t in rehab for six months; I was in intense behavior modification. It was supposed to fix me because I felt bad for what happened to Sam. My mom has legally married every man she’s been with. She’s legally inherited their fortune or won it in a divorce settlement. The authorities can’t do anything for me. And I’m not being abused.” 
	Ryder’s jaw locked in thought. A muscle kept ticking in his cheek and for just a moment I felt relieved to have someone share my same frustration. But then the hopelessness caught up with me again and I spiraled back to the pits of despair. 
	“Okay, if there’s nothing legal we can do, then we’ll just get you out of here. Your trust fund, right? Why can’t you take that now? Matt has friends around the world from when he went traveling, they would help you. Or at least house you for a while. I could even go with you for a little bit, help you get set up,” he sat forward, excited by his solution and I loathed being the one who had to destroy those hopes. I knew, firsthand, what it would feel like. 
	I shook my head first, my eyes filling with tears again. “I’ve already thought something like that through. Right now my trust is untouchable until I’m eighteen and have graduated high school. Those conditions are unbreakable. Trust me, I’ve looked into it,” Although I didn’t want to get his hopes up so I refrained from telling him about Smith and his secret team of lawyers. “And besides, even if I could get to it now, I wouldn’t leave. I have a sister, half-sister really, Honor. She’s only eleven and I just can’t leave her yet. I mean, I will one day, I will, but not yet. I want to protect her as long as I can.” 
	“She lives with your mom?” Ryder asked, looking sick all over again. 
	“No, she lives with her dad. She’s…. He’s special. I mean, he was one of my mom’s marks, years ago. Not just for his money, but because she wanted another child too. But he was supposed to die. He had stage four brain cancer. He somehow survived and then, when he recovered it was like he was immune to the whole Siren thing. He’s not affected by my mom, by any of us. He has custody of Honor. And he is protecting her for now; he barely lets my mom see her. But everyone in my circle wants my mom to have custody, obviously, so Honor is not safe. Nix will do anything to get her.” 
	“He’s immune? Has that ever happened before?” Ryder asked carefully and I could see a light go on in his eyes. 
	“Just one other time that I’m aware of,” I answered quietly. 
	“With me?” He clarified like he knew the truth already. 
	I nodded, afraid that the spell would be broken. “With the coffee, in the hallway…. I mean, you didn’t feel anything did you?”
	Ryder thought about it for a while and then replied, “Just irritation. Lots of irritation.”
	I rolled my eyes but let out a soft laugh. “You’re so obnoxious.” 
	“That’s what was with my dad and uncle?” 
	I nodded again. “That’s what’s with everybody.”
	“But it’s not like they were worshipping at your feet,” he argued. I recognized his desire to stand up for those he loved, to make them appear strong and capable. Nobody wanted to be helpless against a force they couldn’t control.
	“The pull gets harder to resist the longer you’re around me. And sometimes, with stronger personalities, it takes longer to be affected. Weak men feel my pull even before I’m near them. But some, very strong men, can subconsciously resist for a while. For everybody but you, and Honor’s father,” I explained. “As long as you’re being honest. As long as you really don’t feel anything between us.” 
	“That’s why you warned me before? About falling for you?” His voice was soft and understanding. 
	“Yes,” I agreed simply. 
	“We’ll figure this out, Ivy,” he promised. “You’re not alone. You have me, you have friends. We will get you out of this.” 
	“Thank you,” I whispered against the biting wind. And meant it for so many more things than his promise. 
The sun had dropped from its morning high point to the other side of the sky and I shivered against the temperature that had also dropped. Ryder pulled me closer and we sat in silence for a while until I pulled myself together. He helped me wipe my face clean of makeup and then stand to my feet.
“I need to get home,” I said through a throaty voice. “My mom is probably wondering where I am by now.”
“I don’t want to take you back there,” he growled in a primal, protective voice.
“It’s okay, Ryder, I have to go at some point,” I tried to make my voice sound light and casual, but neither of us were convinced. “Besides, Nix is out of town right now. My mom is almost harmless when he’s not around.”
“Nix? The pimp-slash-conman?” Ryder snarled.
A laugh bubbled out before I could stop myself, “Yes, my pimp-slash-conman.” 
“You’ll be alright?” he asked while he rubbed a hand up and down over my back.
	“Mmm-hmm, I’ll be alright.” And I would be. 
	“Then I agree to take you home,” he offered magnanimously. “But only if you text or call me the second you are not alright, okay? For any reason, for anything. Real danger, or emotional or anything, Ivy. Promise me you’ll call.” 
	“I promise.” I closed my eyes and savored the moment before Ryder led me down from the roof and through the stairwell back to his car. I had never had anyone I could count on before. Even if I never used Ryder’s number as a distress call, his offer would mean more to me than he would ever know. 
	Finally, finally, he felt like the friend I kept convincing myself he was.
	A real friend.

Chapter Thirty-One

	I walked as quietly into the apartment as I could, trying not to make a single sound. But it was a wasted effort because she was waiting for me. Her posture was absolutely perfect, her arms crossed elegantly across her chest so that her freshly manicured nails lay undisturbed. Her brilliant red hair cascaded over her shoulders in loose waves and her slinky outfit clung to her like a glove. She was perfection except for the scowl twisting her face into sheer disappointment. 
	“Where have you been?” She hissed. 
	“Chase took me to breakfast this morning,” I mumbled. I needed to fess up about breaking it off with him, but not yet, not until I had anybody besides Ryder to use. 
	“You went to breakfast… looking like that?” She sneered openly at me. “You look like hell, Ivy! Have you been crying?”
“No, I, uh-”
“Spit it out,” she commanded in clipped tones. “And I swear, if this is about that Sam kid again, I will call Nix this instant and make him come clean this up. I cannot handle this anymore.” Her voice was bordering on screeching and she was red in the face. This was so not behavior my rational, cold, distant mother would normally condone.
	“Mom, chill,” I broke in before she really got hysterical. “I broke up with Chase this morning. It’s not a big deal. I just felt bad. That’s all. This isn’t about Sam.” Not entirely.
	She paused at my interruption, sanity returned to her face and she visibly calmed down. “You broke up with him? I thought Nix gave you a timeline?” 
	“I had to, I didn’t want to drag things out and then…” I paused not wanting to use Sam as an excuse. It was on the tip of my tongue, the lie, the reason… but it seriously made my stomach turn.
	“Alright, Ivy, I get it,” she rolled her eyes at me. “We do not want a repeat of your meltdown.” She visibly shuddered, “Can you imagine how embarrassing that would be?”
	“I can imagine,” I said on a bitter laugh. 
	“Enough of your sarcasm. You need to get ready. We’re expected at Thalia’s in an hour and a half.” She started walking to the kitchen but paused to give me another once over. “Does that give you enough time to become presentable?” 
	“Yes,” I sighed. Thalia was Sloane’s mother and I was more than ready to spend some time with Sloane and Exie, especially after spilling my guts to Ryder. But an evening with the circle of women without Nix present, meant I had to be. This wasn’t a dinner party, this was a gossip session and my mother fully expected me to participate. 
	Bleh. 
	An hour later I was showered and beautified and ready to go. I hung out near the entry way, straightening the kitchen and wasting time while I waited for my mother to do…. whatever it was she needed to do before we left. She made a big deal about being there on time but if Nix wasn’t waiting on her, my mother was under the impression that she needed to make everybody wait on her.
	Including me.
	Finally she walked into the kitchen looking the same as when I left her. Her dress was made by a different designer, but basically the same style and her hair was maybe fluffed, but that was it. She gave me a scathing, calculated glance before I received the nod of approval. Ugh, and we were just going to dinner with other women! 
	A Town car was waiting for us when we reached the ground floor, heaven forbid my mother drive. And then we were silent until we reached Sloane’s sprawling midtown home. I realized when the car stopped in front of Sloane’s house that Exie’s mother, Echo, hadn’t thrown a party in a while. 
	There was only a second to contemplate that before my own mother was rapping her knuckles against the black painted door and Thalia was welcoming us with her wide, fake smile and perfectly coiffed black hair. 
	“So happy you could finally join us,” Thalia cooed, referencing my mother’s inability to be on time. 
	“So are we,” my mother echoed without any enthusiasm. Technically we were all chained to the same destiny, working for Nix, but somehow my mother and I as sirens held a higher rank of respectability than Exie or Sloane’s family. It had something to do with our ability to bring in the cash. 
	Basically because we could be bigger sluts than them, we were worth more.
	Disgusting, right? 
	“The girls are in the dining room, Ivy,” Thalia mentioned over her shoulder before she escorted my mother to the kitchen where a fresh cocktail would be waiting for her. 
	I left them without a word and worked my way to the dining room. I didn’t meet anyone on the way so I had to assume this was a small gathering. Hopefully the party was contained to my mom and me, Exie’s family and Sloane’s family. All women, so it was bound to get catty after a while, but it was better than performing for middle-aged men and pretending I was interested the entire night.
	Especially after talking to Ryder. There was this rebellious freedom pulsing through my veins tonight and I knew I couldn’t be trusted to behave. 
	He had lit something inside me, something that demanded to be set free. But the rational part of my brain warned that it was still too soon. That until my trust fund was available I still had a part to play.
	“Well, hey there gorgeous,” Anaxandra called as I walked into the dining room. The long French vintage table, set to accommodate all of us, shined with polish and pretty cornflower blue patterned China.
	“Hey,” I smiled. I held back my disappointment at seeing Anaxandra and Evaleen already seated with Exie and Sloane. I wanted a few minutes alone with them so I could tell them about Ryder, but now was obviously the wrong time. “So what is this? Dinner with the families?” 
	“The families” was what we called our inner circle, a reference to the mob. Not that we were the mob, although there were definite connections, but in this area of the country, my family, Exie’s and Sloane’s were the top of the pyramid. 
	“Organizational,” Evaleen confirmed.
	“Strategic and logistical,” Sloane added, rolling her eyes. 
	“So we’ll be here for what, the next twelve hours? Hope your mom ordered lots of alcohol,” I groaned. 
	“Did Ava tell you nothing about this?” Evaleen asked suspiciously. 
	“We’re not on the best of terms right now.” I avoided their eyes and focused on finding the right chair…. far enough away from the adults that I could actually enjoy dinner without being obvious about ignoring my mother.
	“Why not? What happened this time?” Anaxandra gasped. She was the one who taught me how valuable my mother was. Our mothers were our only allies in this world. Where a friend’s mother would only view me as competition for her own daughter, it behooved my mother for me to do well. Ava always treated me like royalty before Sam and my six month exile; I was her crowning jewel, her legacy. But now I was this dark cloud over her carefully plotted parade. 
	If I cared before, I didn’t now. Ava’s only motivation for treating me well before had been purely political and manipulative. Nothing she did for me was done out of something as simple as mother-daughter love. That thought was only laughable. And now that I knew the difference, now that I knew the truth, I didn’t miss her attention, or her affection.
	“Who knows,” I sighed. 
	“How can you be so casual about this, Ivy?” Anaxandra snapped. “You need to fix whatever is broken and fast.”
	“Ana, let her be,” Exie spoke up for the first time, tossing her golden curls over her shoulder. “Whatever’s going on with her mom is her business, not yours.”
	“We look out for each other,” Anaxandra defended and I saw a spark of the old her flash brightly. “Ava will throw you to the wolves if you’re not careful,” her voice dropped to an earnest whisper and her eyes pleaded with me to take her seriously. 
	“She’s right, Ives,” Evaleen leaned forward with critical eyes. She dressed to kill tonight, which surprised me a little since this was just a girls’ night. Her chestnut hair was lifted off her neck in an intricate updo that piled on top of her head. One lone strand of long hair had slipped out and curved gracefully around the back of her neck. Her dark eyes were beseeching at the same time they were cunning and her perfect, rosebud lips were pressed into a frown. “You’re the firstborn, that means she has an entire other child to turn her attentions to if you screw up anymore.” 
	“Maybe in other families, but not so in mine,” I divulged. “Honor is in no way ever leaving Smith. He has her on complete lockdown.”
	“How is that possible?” Anaxandra hissed.
	“Plus, it doesn’t matter how Ava feels about Ivy,” Exie spoke up conspiratorially. “Nix wants her, so she’s safe.”
	“Shut up!” Eva gasped. “Nix wants you? Like he wants to take you?” 
	I blushed a deep, revealing red and stared intently at the flower pattern on the ivory China. “Uh, yeah.”
	“When?” Ana demanded. 
	“After I graduate,” I whispered.
	There was silence at the table then as we all absorbed this information. A pain shot out from my chest and pierced every piece of me. I recognized the feeling as debilitating fear, the kind of fear you couldn’t pretend didn’t exist or ignore or runaway from. This fear reared up and made itself known, promised more and never, ever let go.
	Tinkling, forced laughter came from the hallway and as if on cue we all sat up straighter and put hands to our hair to make sure it was in place. Our mothers entered the room as one unit, smiling and beaming at each other. Their cold gazes assessed us at the table like they were robots sharing the same brain. When they finally decided everything was as it should be they joined as at the table, sitting together at one end so they could continue their business. 
	Dinner was served as soon as they sat down. A hired team of caterers brought out cold soup and small bread platters that went untouched. I never understood why so much food was ordered for these events, when these women barely ate any of it. Even I knew better than to snatch a dinner roll even though I had been eyeing one for the last twenty minutes. 
	During soup the conversation was mostly lulled to topics like the weather for traveling, winter break destinations and new purchases. The salad course was next and discussion deepened to subjects like education beliefs and local elections, which was mostly important for how the courts ruled over Honor and my mother. The third course, prime rib cut into tiny little strips and served over a creamy risotto intensified the dialog further and we began to discuss the politics of our circle.
	“So, Ava,” Thalia began, “Nix is planning to stay in town for a while, is that right?” 
	Echo jumped in, “I heard that too. It has something to do with Ivy, doesn’t it?” 
	“Nix wants her,” my mother answered proudly. Her eyes lit up for the first time all night, and a real smile played at the corner of her lips. “He’s asked her to join him after graduation.”
	All other conversation stopped at this point and we all turned to my mother. Anaxandra, who happened to be sitting next to me, put a hand on mine under the table to reassure me. This surprised me more than my mother’s forwardness. I thought Ana was completely converted to the dark side, but maybe not. 
	“And she agreed of course?” Thalia’s cool gaze pinned me to my chair, daring me to deny anything. The wicked queen to her daughter’s Snow White looks, she had all the beauty Evaleen and Sloane did except she was aging and she knew it. The wrinkles in her laugh line and looser skin had turned her cruel and greedy.
	“He hasn’t asked me formally, yet,” I clarified even though I knew it would cost my mother. “He just mentioned it at dinner once.” I tore my eyes from Thalia’s triumphant stare and noticed the sky had gone completely dark outside. We had been here for hours and there were still hours to get through yet. 
	“He intends to take her,” my mother spelled out with force. “We’ve had several conversations about her.”
	“Won’t that leave you without a legacy?” Echo asked and the note of laughter rang out in the room. These women were so catty; I could feel the few bites I allowed myself for dinner threaten to reappear. 
	“I have Honor,” Ava returned serenely.
	“And if Smith always keeps her? If she is never allowed out of that house?” Thalia scoffed. “What then?”
	“Honor will be my legacy; there is no question about that. Nix wants Ivy enough that he will make sure I get Honor,” Ava promised self-confidently. 
	A jolting shiver washed down my back and I was sure I would be sick for a few moments. Eventually the racking nausea slowed and I looked up in time to watch my mother smirk at her supposed best friends. “Honor will never go with you,” I spat in a hushed tone before I even registered the words were being said. 
	Oops.
	My mother’s scathing glare swept towards me and I summoned every ounce of courage I possessed to sit up straight and stare her in the eyes. A collective intake of breath could be heard around the room and then everything was silent while my mother’s rage grew until I could feel it pouring off her in waves. 
	“What a strong spirit you have, Ivy,” Thalia broke the charged silence with the backhanded compliment. “No wonder Nix wants to add you to his collection.”
	Strangled laughter erupted in Ava and her restrained fury turned her eyes wild. “My daughter? Strong spirit?” more crazed laughter. “You forget that this is the same child that needed to be sent away after her breakup. One broken heart and she’s a mental case! Nix is saving us all from the disaster she brings with her. She is a tragedy waiting to happen. No, Ivy has always been too weak for this world, too weak for anything of worth.”
	“Weak?” I choked on the word; it felt vile and repulsive in my mouth. I had survived this long, made it this far with her and with him and she was calling me weak! I felt the presence enter the room behind me and pause in the doorway, but I was too emotionally involved to stop myself now. “No, not weak. I have a soul. That may be a weakness to you, but it is not to me. I have common decency, some f-ing standards and you call that weak! Of course I don’t fit in; I’m trying to be a good person, to be better than this life you force me to live.” 
	I jumped at the sound of the next voice, even though instinct warned me he would be there. 
	“It’s not about being a good person, Ivy,” Nix calmly soothed from behind me. I felt his voice grow more placating as he walked into the dining room. Every head swiveled around with mouth agape to stare at him. He was picture perfect in his pressed suit and shiny shoes, but his tie was absent and the top button of his white oxford was undone. He fiddled with one of his cufflinks and then continued, “You should be concerned about my expectations for you, my desire for you. You’re mother’s right, the rest is weakness, not anything else. And definitely a waste of time.”
	“What isn’t a waste of time, Nix?” I asked with more contempt than I felt. Not that I didn’t feel hatred but it was being severely overshadowed by fear at the moment.
	“Money, Ivy. Money is never a waste of time.” His hands rested on the top of my high-back chair and I straightened out my spine just to keep from shrinking beneath his powerful presence. 
	“Oh, that’s right. Because money makes the world go round, right Nix?” I held his gaze bravely. As desperately as I wanted to look away from his dark, relentless eyes I wouldn’t allow myself to show the weakness they accused me of.
	Nix’s smooth, solid façade cracked at my words, anger flashed in his expression and I felt his grip tighten against the chair all the way down to my toes.
	“No, Ivy,” he barked out at me. “I make the world go round. Me! And it would behoove you not to forget that.” He reigned in his temper and smoothed out his features and it was like a tornado had been destroying the room around me and then suddenly sucked through a window. The calm after the storm was as eerie and deadly as the storm itself and I shuddered despite my resolve not to show fear. “Eva, call a cab for Ivy. I want her out of my sight for now.” 
	With that last command he turned his back on me and stalked from the room. The entire room stayed still even with his absence until Eva finally reached for her cell phone and followed his orders. I had been banished for the rest of the evening. And even though a pit of absolute terror started to grow in my stomach and spread roots to my heart and lungs, I was thankful to be excused from this gathering. If I continued to misbehave like this I knew I would have to face discipline, but I couldn’t stop myself. 
	I just didn’t want to know what that meant for me.

Chapter Thirty-Two

	This time the ride to visit Honor was more tense than normal. My mother hadn’t talked to me since last night at Sloane’s, except to tell me when she was leaving for Honor’s. She hadn’t left it an option to decline, but I didn’t plan on it anyways. 
	We pulled up to Honor’s and went through the same routine as always. She walked with me to the front door and raised her hand to knock, except at the last minute she pulled back.
	“Ivy, I’m not mad at you for last night,” she allowed calmly. “Regardless of how you feel right now, you need to know that I am not your enemy. I am your ally. I have your best interest in mind. If you don’t want to go to Nix, I’m trying to understand that, but then you and I need to work together. Alright?” 
	I thought over her words for a moment, not really accepting them, but knowing I needed to appear to. She was right in that if worse came to worst she was my only supporter in staying away from Nix.
	“Alright, mom,” I conceded. “I’m sorry for my behavior last night and recently. I just, what happened with Sam scared me. And I’m over it now, I really am,” I lied, “But I guess I’m a little…. I don’t know, like gun shy or something. Okay? I’ll try to be better though, I promise.” 
	“Oh sweetheart, I understand,” she cooed and then drew me into a stiff hug before I could wiggle away from her. “I know you’ll try harder. I know you won’t embarrass me again.” 
	She gave me an air kiss while I kind of stood there stunned. Eventually she let go of me and turned her attention back to the door. She pressed the doorbell with a long French nail and then waited tranquilly for Smith or one of his assistants to open the door. 
	It was the assistant this week, a twenty-something woman probably straight out of MBA school. They all clamored to work with Smith, to learn from the master of business. But Smith would only let women work for him. Not because he was some pervy womanizer, but solely to protect his life and Honor. He would never trust a man in his house. 
	The assistant didn’t say anything to us, just moved out of the way and allowed us to enter. She silently turned on her one inch practical pump and led the way down the hall. Smith’s assistants were generally all the same. Not that he had a type, but mainly because he required a dress code. Hair pulled back tight, pant suit or skirt suit and low heels. They all looked like uniformed flight attendants from the fifties, but I kept my opinion to myself. 
	In the sitting room, we were alone for a few minutes. My mother made herself at home, flinging herself onto one of the couches and crossing her legs impatiently. I paced around the room nervously. I felt itchy in my skin after the makeup session with my mom outside and anxious for her sudden compulsion to forgive and forget. Was she putting on a show for Smith’s benefit or was this something more sinister? Was Nix doling out the punishment so she felt like she could let go? Or was this really a gesture of maternal instinct, possibly her first one ever?
	“Ivy!” Honor squealed from the doorway. She bounded across the space between us and threw herself into my outstretched arms. Whatever nervous energy was there before disappeared with my sister so close and so happy to see me.
	“Hey, little one,” I whispered into her hair. “How are you?”
	“So good,” she exclaimed and then pulled back from me. She wrapped her long auburn hair around her hand a few times and then lifted it off her neck. She twisted around at the waist until finally I noticed the two blue sapphire studs in her ears. 
	“Oh my gosh! You got your ears pierced!” I screamed high and loud enough for any eleven year old to be proud of. 
	“I know!” She was so ecstatic, she dropped her hair and grabbed on to my forearms so we could dance around and shriek at each other.
	Honor had wanted her ears pierced forever, for as long as she could talk. Mom pierced mine when I was a baby and so Honor grew up fascinated by the pretty things hanging from my ears. She started bugging Smith about it two years ago. He resisted for, well, since then, but something must have happened between last week and this one to get him to cave. 
	“Let’s see, darling. Come show me,” my mother commanded from her perch on the couch. 
	Honor stopped jumping around with me immediately and walked over to our mom to show them off. Smith stood in the doorway smiling at me. 
	“What did she do to convince you?” I asked with a smug smile. 
	“What didn’t I do?” Honor sighed dramatically and then plopped down next to mom. Ava extended her thin arm across the back of the couch and Honor snuggled right in. I ignored the picture of pure evil wrapped around perfect innocence and tried to school my expression into anything but the disgust I felt. 
	“She had to receive all A’s this quarter and she volunteered at some of my charitable causes,” Smith explained in his dignified voice. “She had to earn them, but she worked very hard. I am very proud of her.”
	“Plus, there’s a dance next weekend,” Honor’s whole face lit up in expectation. 
	“But we haven’t decided if you will go, Honor,” Smith reminded her with gentle authority. 
	“Have you been asked by a boy?” It was my mother’s turn to get excited. These were exactly the signs she was looking for, more reason for her to want to possess Honor. 
	Honor blushed deeply, from the top of her hairline to her ankles. “Yes, but daddy says I can’t go with a boy. If I go to the dance, I’ll just go with friends.” 
	“What is his name?” my mother pressed, ignoring Smith’s scowl. 
	“Ava, she’s only eleven. She’s too young for this, do not encourage her.” Smith growled. 
	Usually Smith and my mom tried to hide their utter hatred for each other, but this would definitely be a volatile issue. My mom kept her easy smile and started to run her fingers through Honor’s hair. It was a soothing motion that she used to do to me when I was a child, her trick to lull me into trusting her. I wouldn’t let her do that with Honor.
	“You can’t keep her locked in a tower her whole life, Smith. It’s not like she can’t meet the boy at the dance. If she really wants to go with him, she’ll find a way,” my mother’s smile turned smug. She knew she was planting ideas into Honor’s head. 
	From the way Smith’s face heated up and his hands clenched viciously, I started to think he knew it too.
	“Honor, are those the only earrings you have? Or did Smith let you pick out another pair for when your ears are healed?” I asked quickly. 
	“Daddy let me pick out two pair,” she gushed. She sat up out of our mother’s arms beaming again. 
	“Will you show them to me?” I took a step toward her and extended my hand.
	She leapt from the couch and attached herself to me. I gave my mother an apologetic smile, but she just waved me out of the room with a roll of the eyes. At the doorway I chanced a glance back at Smith who was looking at me with an unreadable expression. He didn’t hold my gaze though, fury twisted his features and before we were to the staircase Honor and I could hear them arguing heatedly. 
	Honor’s room was a princess palace. Decorated in all white and soft pink, there was an enormous canopy bed fit for royalty with matching dressers, vanity and night stands. A huge dollhouse took up one entire wall, extending even higher than Honor could reach and another wall displayed floor to ceiling bookcases with a moving ladder connected to the ceiling. Smith seriously spoiled his little girl.
But she was so lucky to have her father. 
Fate balanced life out for her in this way. Because as lucky as she was to have Smith, she was as equally unlucky to have our mother.
	So what did Fate give me? Where was my equalizer?
	Or maybe I didn’t get one. Maybe life stepped in and decided a balance wouldn’t have done any good. I would be this same rotten, black-hearted witch with or without a representative from the good side.
	“Is it because Tyler asked me out?” she whispered when the door closed behind us. The earrings were forgotten in the wake of the crestfallen expression painting her face. 
	“No, absolutely not,” I rushed to pull her into a hug. “They don’t agree, that’s all. It has nothing to do with you. I promise.”
	“But it does have something to do with me,” she whimpered.
	“No, it doesn’t, sweet pea. Your father loves you very much is all. He wants to protect you. And mom… Mom doesn’t always know what’s best for you, Honor. She sometimes… sometimes she wants bad things for you.”
	This was the most honest I’d ever been with my little sister. She was too young to see the evil creature that was Ava Pierce, and I didn’t want her to end up resenting me or Smith because I pushed her too hard. And now I wondered if I had made a mistake when she looked up at me with shimmering eyes and a deflated expression. 
	“Does she want bad things for you too?” Honor whispered, the horror in her face making her green eyes shine with tears.
	I was momentarily stunned. Maybe Honor was more perceptive than I gave her credit for. Not really knowing how to respond, I just hugged her tighter and said, “Hey, don’t worry about me, okay? I’m just fine. It’s you we have to worry about. With these newly pierced ears Tyler’s not the only boy we’re going to have to worry about.” 
	I regretted the words as soon as they left my lips. 
	“Ivy?” Honor asked in such a small voice that I closed my eyes against the sudden anxiety I felt for her. “Tyler’s not the only boy. Lots of boys asked me to the dance, but Tyler’s the only one I liked enough to think about going with.” 
	“Oh, really?” I closed my eyes tighter, but this time against tears. I hated that she would have to go through this mostly alone, and without any idea of why this was happening to her. 
	“Don’t you think it’s weird?” she asked truly perplexed. 
	“Was it a lot of boys?” 
	“All the boys… In my class and in seventh grade,” she confessed in that worried tone again. “But I didn’t tell daddy that.”
	Oh no. I could not let her get away with that. I walked her over to her big bed and sat down with her so that I could face her. “Hon, don’t keep that kind of stuff from your dad, okay? I know it might seem embarrassing, or it might be hard to tell him the truth, but he really does want what’s best for you. He won’t get mad at you; it’s not anything you did wrong, okay? He can probably help you, make it easier for you.”
	She nodded along, seeming to understand how important it was to be honest with Smith by my freaked out tone. 
	“Ivy, is something happening to me?” she whispered in that frightened little voice again. 
	“Honey, no! Why would you think that?” 
	“Because… because it’s not just the boys. It’s the girls too,” she admitted and then looked away. 
	“What about the girls?” Suddenly there was ice in my veins. I remembered what middle school was like for me away from Sloane and Exie, completely on my own. It was awful. Girls were cruel, and the boys were relentless. 
	“They stopped being nice to me,” she croaked. Her chin trembled and then a tiny little tear slipped from the corner of her eye. I wiped it away quickly with my thumb and then held her face in my hands so she was forced to look at me. 
	“Honor, there is nothing wrong with you. You are perfect and special and wonderful. No matter what anybody else says, or does, you have to know that is true about you. You are the one that decides how you feel, okay? You make you matter. And I think you are the greatest eleven year-old in the universe and my opinion matters too.” She laughed at that with a watery smile. “I love you, okay?” 
	“Okay,” she mumbled, throwing her arms around my neck. “I love you too!”
	And then my eyes were brimming with tears. 
	A knock at the door and Smith walking into the room tore us apart from each other. Smith looked back and forth between us before deciding that whatever had caused the tears must have been a good thing because his face softened and a sweet smile turned his mouth. 
	“Honor, your mother would like to spend more time with you before she goes,” he instructed. Honor stood up and gave me one more confident smile before disappearing into the hall.
	I stood up too, wanting to follow her before my mother got her alone again. Smith stopped me with a raised hand though and asked me to wait. 
	“Mallory talked to you this week?” he whispered. 
	I nodded and then stole a glance at the door just in case my mother suddenly appeared.
	“Please let her try,” he begged in a rumbling whisper. 
	“Okay,” I said quickly. “I told her okay.” 
	Smith immediately relaxed, his face smoothing out to happy. “Good, Ivy. That is good.” 	
	We both moved toward the door before I said, “Have you thought about homeschooling Honor?” My voice was as quiet as I could make it without having to resort to smoke signals to communicate with Smith.
	“After last week, I’m seriously considering all-girls school,” he sighed. Smith ran a rough hand over his face showing me how much he realized this problem was going to cost him.
	“Please don’t do that. It would crush her,” I pleaded. I grabbed onto the sleeve of his navy blue oxford and gripped it tightly. “All-girls could be… could be rough… Could be traumatizing. It would push her right to my mother.” 
	He thought over my words carefully, taking them in, chewing on them and then visibly deciding that they were helpful. “Homeschooling? You really think I need to remove her from society completely?”
	“No,” I answered quickly. “Not completely. But enough so that you can keep an eye on her and help her mature. She will never be like my mother. She has you. It won’t happen to her. But it won’t stop either, what happened last week will never stop. She has to learn to…. handle it.”
	“What is this Ivy? What has its claws on my little girls’ life? On your life?” Smith’s voice broke on his last question. I could see how sickly worried he was for Honor, how desperate he was to protect her from our mother and everything she represented. “Is it something I can stop?”
	“It’s uh,” I obviously couldn’t reveal my secret twice in the same weekend. “It’s just bad genetics. Honestly, Smith. Just think about homeschooling, please?”
	He nodded his agreement and before he could ask me anymore questions or before my mother spent one more second alone with Honor, I bounded down the steps and rejoined my family. 
	Homeschooling, although dreadful, would protect Honor. And right now that was my only goal in life. I wondered how different my life would be if I had someone to protect me.
	And then I thought about Ryder and how desperate he was to help me.
	So maybe my bad did balance out after all.
	Maybe I did have someone special looking out for me.

Chapter Thirty-Three

	The next day at school I felt this weird mixture of strong hope and eternal despair. My situation was depressing. Nix was scary as all hell. And he was back early from Greece. My future loomed bleak and ominous on the horizon. 
	But Ryder gave me this smile when I walked up to the school this morning that was secret and meaningful and…. possessive. His eyes grazed over me from head to foot as if he were searching for something physically out of place. And then his powerful silver eyes met mine and held them, connected me to him and transferred some of his indomitable strength to me.
	I could smile then. Breathe again. 
	And it was because Ryder knew my secret and decided I was still worth friendship. 
	We hadn’t actually spoken to each other yet today. He was with Chase and Phoenix in front of the building and I wanted to avoid all things Chase for a while. But just knowing Ryder supported me, made getting through the monotony of the day easier, made everything easier. 
	Between fifth and sixth period I found myself alone in an upstairs bathroom. I was kind of just wasting time and messing around with my hair when three girls walked in laughing loudly. They were giggling about boys and parties over the weekend. I recognized them instantly, cheerleaders that used to hang around Sam and the other basketball guys. Maybe they still did, I avoided the entire basketball crowd like a death sentence. 
	There laughter evaporated when they noticed me, their expressions puckering like someone had sucked all the oxygen from the room. And maybe someone had because I was finding it hard to breathe again. The shortest girl, also the ring leader from what I remembered lifted a slender finger and circled it around slowly, pointing at me, marking me.
	“Well, look who it is,” I thought her name might have been Cammie snarled. 
	A taller, thicker girl, who was maybe Jayla, huffed out a bitter puff of laughter. “Heard you were back, Ivy. I also heard you were making your rounds on the soccer team now. Slut.”
	“Whore,” Cammie quickly reinforced their nasty sentiment. So we obviously would not be sharing our grief over Sam today.
	“Why did you even come back?” The third girl asked with so much pain and loathing that I almost forgot my own problems with hers glaring so achingly bright. Her name was Cassandra, and she was drop dead gorgeous. Perfect mocha skin, long silky black hair, the darkest, deepest black eyes. She was prettier than me. Smarter than me. And had been dating Sam for two entire years before I showed up. 
	Before he broke up with her for me. 
	I sucked in an ugly, ragged breath and willed myself to meet her eyes. “I didn’t have a choice,” I admitted with not even a hint of strength or poise. 
	Cassandra bit out a bark of laughter. “Well, isn’t that just nice for you.” 
	Cammie took a step towards me. She was tiny and petite but packed with muscle. All these girls were. And even though I wasn’t helpless if it came to a fight, I knew without a doubt I wouldn’t fight back. This was a punishment I wanted, I felt like I deserved and I was going to take it. 
	“You shouldn’t have come back,” Cammie threatened in a menacing voice. “Nobody wants you here, nobody wants to watch you ruin someone else’s life. You’re a cheap skank that destroys people. You make me sick.” 
	My heart started hammering in my chest so loud I was positive they could hear it, hear my fear and self-loathing. Hot tears stabbed at my eyes and I shut them quickly to stay that weakness. I didn’t mind being the target for all their insults, or even their punching bag, but crying in front of them seemed too pathetic even for me. 
	The bathroom door opened and surprise of all surprises Kenna Lee walked in. She had her purse in her hand and seemed to be in a hurry, but when she stumbled into the trinity-of-hatred she paused. Her head snapped back and forth between them and me.
	“What’s going on, Ivy?” she asked in a hesitant tone. 
	Damn it, why did this stuff always happen in the bathroom? And why was it always freaking Kenna Lee?
	“Nothing,” I whispered, but even I heard how tragic I sounded.
	“Cassandra?” she questioned instead. 
	“We’re just leaving,” Cassandra said in a bored tone. She looked me up and down one more time, taking in all of me, my hunched shoulders, my nails dug painfully into my palms, my hair that seemed to be everywhere at the moment, my forehead that had started to sweat and my wild eyes that couldn’t escape the guilt and shame for what had happened to Sam. “I hate you,” she confessed in a mean, ugly voice. “I have never hated anyone like I hate you.” She paused for several moments, seeming to compose herself. “But he still asks about you. Not…. he can’t…. it’s in his eyes. It’s how he watches the door. The least you could do is pay him a visit. Ease his suffering some.” 
	Her words floored me. I felt like she just punched me in the heart. The wind was knocked all the way out of me. I stood their trembling, shaking from head to toe while she and her friends gave me one more disdainful look and then they turned as one unit and left the bathroom. 
	Kenna disappeared into a stall and all the while I stood there staring at the door, not able to move or react. She reappeared in front of me. She washed her hands and then pulled some paper towels from the dispenser without saying a word. While she dried her hands she looked me over with the kind of pity that was reserved for abused circus animals. Like her shame for me was so strong it bordered on disgust. 
	“Ivy, this is the second time I’ve rescued you in a bathroom,” she sighed, sounding somewhat exhausted. “So you’ve made some enemies? So what? Life goes on. It has to and you can’t stop it. Learn to stand up for yourself for God’s sake.”
	I jumped at her words. There was a time not that long ago that I knew how to stand up for myself. I knew exactly what I was and even if I didn’t want to accept my future, I could at least accept my reality. But now? Now the guilt ate away at every good, strong piece of me until I didn’t want to stand up for myself, until I wanted someone else to tell me exactly what I already knew.
	“You’re right,” I mumbled instead. No need to belittle her efforts. 
	“Listen, it’s not like… Okay, you and me are never going to be friends, right?” I nodded weakly, hating that her words were truth. “But, I care about Ryder. I mean, even though- I care about him despite how we ended things. I just don’t want to see you hurt him, alright? Can you at least try to be gentle with him?”
	“Wait.” My heart slammed against my chest and then dropped to my stomach. “What?”
	“Oh, I thought Ryder would have told you. I thought Ryder had a thing- I guess, never mind.” Kenna looked thoughtful for a moment and then waved her hand in the air as if swatting away the idea.
	“Ryder broke up with you? And you thought it was because of me?” I squeaked out, feeling suddenly very sick to my stomach. The world kind of reeled around and my vision started spotting. This was very bad news.
	“What?” Kenna asked abruptly. “No, I broke up with Ryder. I had a thing- Hayden and I have been talking for a while and I didn’t think it was fair to Ryder.” She looked at me closely. “Although I don’t know why I’m telling you that.” 
	“Oh,” I started, feeling completely disoriented. 
	“Sorry, he always said you guys were just friends. But I don’t know, I had a feeling it was more.” Kenna looked thoughtful for a moment before straightening. “Guess, I was wrong.”
	“Uh, yeah, we’re just friends,” I confirmed, feeling a little flattened. Which made no sense. “Um, can I ask when you guys broke up?” 
	She looked at me sharply and then the pity was back. Oh great, she thought I had a thing for Ryder. Good grief.
	“It was the beginning of last week, like maybe Tuesday?” 
	“But I saw you guys sit together at lunch every day?” I demanded. A righteous anger was building up inside me, I felt lied to. Manipulated. 
	“We’re still friends, Ivy. Not every break up ends badly,” she patronized but then shot me a sidelong glance. “At least for me.” 
	“Huh,” I mused, ignoring her jab. “I thought you guys, I don’t know, I thought you were really into him.”
	“I did too, but I think I was more into Ryder the musician,” she confessed, her lips pouting thoughtfully. “You know what I mean? Ryder as the boyfriend can be…. boring.” 
	“Boring?” I snorted. I never once remembered feeling like Ryder was boring. “Uh, so Hayden, huh?”
	She smiled this ridiculously huge grin and I wondered if it was a special talent of Kenna’s to look like she was in love with every one of her boyfriends. “Mmm-hmmm. He’s not nearly the rock star Ryder is, but we get each other, you know?” 
	“Sure, I know,” I nodded slowly. I didn’t really know, but I could pretend. “Well, um, thanks for intervening. Again.” I smiled at her, hoping to convey my gratitude. But after our weird conversation about her ex and current boyfriend, the confrontation with Cassandra felt almost forgotten.
	Almost. 
	“No problem, Ivy. Just maybe… maybe you should avoid the girls’ bathrooms while you’re at school from now on,” her eyebrows furrowed in concern and I wondered if she had a point.
	“You make a good point,” I sighed and then left her in the bathroom.
	Weird. That was so weird.

Chapter Thirty-Four

	“Are you sure you don’t want some company?” Exie called from the driver’s seat. “I could use some caffeine.” She smiled at me knowingly, daring me to turn her down.
	“No thanks,” I smiled confidently back, like this was no big deal, like I wasn’t blowing off my friend so I could interrogate Ryder until he turned blue. “I need to get to the bottom of this.”
	“I’m sure he wants to get to the bottom of this too,” she winked at me and I rolled my eyes but then slammed her passenger door.
	I watched Exie drive away, thankful she was willing to give me rides again now that Chase and I no longer had the carpool thing going on. I pivoted around and marched into Delice full of determination. 
	Ryder was wiping down the counter with a white rag when the bells over the doorway signaled a customer. He looked up from his task and when his eyes met mine they lit up in that shared secret again. He smiled at me, friendly and casual and I about snapped.
	The café was empty now. The workday hadn’t wound down yet for the surrounding businesses and school had been out for a half an hour so either it was too early for kids around here, or they had already been through on their way home. 
	“Hey, Red,” he called from the counter. I couldn’t see anyone else working with him and wondered if his boss trusted him alone with the store. “Caramel macchiato?”
	I paused midstride, trying to ignore the shiver that slid down my spine because he knew my drink. Not that he hadn’t already ordered it for me a couple times, but it was just so thoughtful… so… No. This was exactly why we needed to have this little chat. 
	“We need to talk,” I barked and planted my hands on the counter. 
	His forehead wrinkled and his eyebrows drew down in concern. “Okay, let’s go,” he walked over and held the gate open that separated everything behind the counter from the rest of the store. He motioned for me to walk through and a little confused I did. He closed the gate behind me, and then led me along to the door that opened to the kitchen and office. 
	When the swinging door stopped moving behind us, he turned to face me, putting two gentle hands on my biceps. We were surrounded by stainless steel kitchen appliances and counters, everything was shiny and cold to the touch. Everything except Ryder’s warm, gentle hands searing my skin even through the material of my shirt. 
	“Why didn’t you tell me you and Kenna broke up?” I demanded out of breath. 
	His forehead smoothed out for a second and then wrinkled in the opposite way when his eyebrows shot up towards his hairline. And then a smug smile turned the corner of his mouth. 
	A soft laughed rumbled out of him and he shrugged a careless shoulder. “I didn’t think it mattered.”
	“It matters,” I argued stubbornly. 
	Ryder took a step closer, closing some of the space between us. The air around us changed, from casual to intense in just a moment. His breath fanned over my face, a mixture of strong coffee and spearmint. His gray eyes heated to pools of liquid silver and his tongue made a small sweep across his bottom lip. 
	“Why?” he whispered, his voice coarse and raspy. It coated the sound as it hit my ears and pushed me a step forward, a step into his arms. 
	“It just does,” I explained without explaining anything. 
	“Yeah?” he asked, his voice that same sexy growl.
	My body heated to a liquid fire. I felt burning hot and tingly and so lost at the moment I didn’t know what to do. My heart hammered in my chest loudly, pounding and furious. My fingertips buzzed with anticipation and my eyesight had narrowed so severely that anything beyond Ryder’s face felt fuzzy and far away. 
	All of a sudden the space between us was filled, brimming over with emotion and tension. There had been some of that before; the space between us had never been empty. But now it was completely full. Atoms and particles and molecules and whatever else occupied the space between zinged around in a wild frenzy, charged with the growing something that enveloped everything separating us.
	“So it matters to you that I’m single,” he dropped his head to just a breath away from mine. I shivered, a quick, jerking motion that propelled me the rest of the distance to Ryder’s body. 
	He caught me, like he was expecting me and in the next moment his mouth was on mine. One hand slipped around my waist pulling me impossibly closer to him, the other sliding up to cradle my neck in his huge hand. His lips pressed against mine so gently, so impossibly careful that I barely felt the soft fullness of them. 
	I was frozen, hypnotized, I couldn’t have moved for anything, not even to intensify the kiss even though that’s all I wanted. And while he seemed to hesitate in indecision, I struggled to step out of my decision. I screamed every argument at myself I could think of, every truth and lie I had been convincing myself of ever since we met. But the most sincere truth, the most base, primal, real truth I could admit to myself was that I wanted to kiss him; I wanted this more than anything. More than freedom. 
	And in the same instant I admitted that to myself, Ryder seemed to come to a conclusion of his own because his lips moved against mine. Delicately at first, and then demanding, hungry. 
	He devoured me. 
	Possessed me.
	And I let him own me. There was no fight against him, no will or resolve left to do anything except give myself up to him.
	I opened my mouth and let his tongue in, let it sweep along mine, so sweet at first, so achingly tantalizing that I felt myself moan into his mouth. A blush heated my neck and began creeping its way up my face, but there was no time to be embarrassed because the sound seemed to flip a switch in him and then all of his inhibitions were gone and he pushed me against the cold metal of the refrigerator and consumed every piece of me. 
	His arms imprisoned me to him, his fingers splayed against my skin, pressing into me as if I would evaporate if he didn’t hold on to me. His mouth was relentless against mine, nipping, licking, sweet then rough, gentle then bruising. I made more sounds, desperate sounds of need that he matched with low groans of satisfaction. 
	The hand on my back tugged at the hem of my shirt and then slipped under so that the heat of his palm scorched the sensitive skin of my spine. I bucked forward, and my arms tightened around his neck. 
	This wasn’t a kiss. This was an epiphany. My moment of clarity.
	My salvation. 
	Ryder’s hand left my back and reached down to cup the back of my thigh. With one swift movement he lifted me off the ground with that one hand, his bicep straining tightly under my grip. He brought my body up and I instinctively wrapped my legs around him. He sighed his approval and then took a stumbling step forward. We tilted off balance, dizzy and upended with desire. He adjusted my weight with his other hand and I clung to his biceps to keep ahold of him. With another stumbling step, he set me on the edge of the metal counter. My legs stayed around his waist and he pushed into me, keeping no distance between us. 
	His lips left mine to explore my jawline, my neck, my collarbone. I dropped my head back to allow him more room and I closed my eyes so that they wouldn’t roll in the back of my head. 
	“Ryder, I whispered against his teasing kisses. 
	He worked his way back up my neck, his tongue sliding sensually over the sensitive skin of my earlobe and then he started to work back to my lips. His fingers grasped my hips, digging into my flesh and holding me in place. I was thankful for his tight grip, thankful that he was holding me in place because I was positive that without his hands supporting me I would have slipped off the counter, slipped out of reality and just floated away. 
	I tightened my legs around his waist, bringing him as close as possible; hating that anything was separating us, even the clothes we were wearing. His hands jerked my waist forward in response, as if I could get closer, as if I would allow anything between us. 
	Through our haze of lust the front door of the café chimed, alerting us that someone had walked in. The faint, distant sound seemed to affect us both simultaneously and we pulled back immediately. Ryder was three steps away before I could blink my eyes open. But the cold reality that washed over me like a bucket of ice forced me to ignore the heartbreaking feeling of emptiness that accompanied the space between us. 
	We stared at each other for a few moments, neither sure what to say. Ryder’s hair was messier than usual, tussled and wild from our minutes of passion. His lips were swollen and more sensual than ever and even though I refused to acknowledge them his hands were trembling just barely at his sides. 
	“Ivy, I-” he started but I cut him off with a wave of a hand. 
	He was the first guy friend I had ever had. Maybe the first real friend I ever had. I couldn’t ruin that. 
	I wouldn’t ruin that. 
	“We, that was, um,” I fumbled through some lame excuse, but my brain was still addled from the desire still pounding through me. Damn it. This was frustrating; I just needed to think of something. 
	But Ryder beat me to it, “Do not read anything into that,” Ryder raised a firm, authoritative voice at me. 
	“Uh, okay,” I agreed, my brow wrinkling just a little and the irrational urge to giggle bubbling up into me.
	He seemed just as desperate as I was to keep things platonic between us. 
	“That was not a kiss,” he reiterated and this time I did laugh.
	“It wasn’t?” I questioned with a smile lifting the corners of my mouth. 
	“No, definitely not. It was… it was, uh, an experiment.” He ran two hands through his already riotously mussed hair. “I just wanted to see if it was as repulsive as I thought it would be.” 
	“And was it?” 
	“Yes. Definitely,” the only tell that he was lying was the way his eyes heated again, as if we were dangerously close to repeating the “experiment” right this second. “Actually it was much worse. You’re a terrible kisser.” 
	The impassioned moment was instantly defused and I burst into laughter. “Thanks for the critique.” 
	“That’s what friends are for,” he smirked at me, casual, lazy and back to normal.
	That’s what friends do. Exactly. Just friends. 
	I took a big breath and hopped off the counter.
	“Okay, I should,” he pointed toward the café. “Right.”
	And then he was through the swinging door and I was alone. I heard his polite tone, muffled but recognizable, ask for the customer’s order. I took the moment to smooth out my rumpled clothes and pull my tangled hair into a low, side ponytail. I pressed my lips together, hoping they weren’t nearly as swollen as Ryder’s had been, but I kind of knew that was asking too much. And then I nonchalantly left the kitchen and walked behind Ryder through the lift-gate counter. 
	“Ivy?” a disturbingly familiar voice asked from in front of the cash register.
	“Nix?” I turned around and faced him straight on. “Hey, what are you doing here?” 
	“Afternoon pick me up,” he gestured toward where Ryder was swiping his credit card and shooting me a sideways glance. “What are you doing here?”
	What was I doing here, damn it? I hadn’t anticipated this. “Um, Ryder and I have a project we’re working on. I was just going over some of the notes with him.”
	“Are you finished with him?” Nix asked, his dark eyes impossible to read. 
	“Huh?” My mouth dropped open at his question and the blush was back crawling up my neck and giving me away. 
	“With your project? I want you to have coffee with me,” he commanded and I just nodded my head in response. 
	“Sure,” I finally choked out. “Ryder and I are done.” 
	Nix turned back to Ryder, “She’ll have a caramel-”
	“Macchiato,” Ryder finished on a snap of possession. I shot him a pleading look that he definitely ignored. And then when Nix held out his card again, Ryder declined him. “She actually already ordered, I just hadn’t made it yet.”
	Nix took this in with a clipped nod and then walked over to a table. He waited for me to follow and sit down before he joined me. He unbuttoned his gray suit jacket and loosened his tie just a tiny bit for comfort. I recognized all these gestures as him getting ready for serious business.
	Nix cocked his head in the direction of Ryder and lifted a thick, black eyebrow at me.
	“Just following orders,” I mumbled.
	His eyebrow descended back to its resting place and his face smoothed out in acceptance of my lie. “I’m glad I caught you here,” he admitted in a low voice. “I was just coming over to talk to you.”
	“Yeah?” I asked. My stomach erupted in nerves. Not nerves like the butterflies Ryder gave me, unless these butterflies had strapped razor blades to their wings and were flying about with the sole intention of shredding me from the inside out until I bled to death. 
	“It seems you have a few things to learn, Ivy. I didn’t want to have to do this, but I’m sending you on a job.” His eyes were pure authoritative arrogance. There was nothing there but cold decisiveness. This was a lesson he decided he needed to teach me. And he was right, if he really thought I was going to stay with him. I needed to be broken, bridled. But because I knew that there was no way in hell I would ever stay with him, a shudder convulsed my body and I gripped at the table so tightly my knuckles turned white.
	Nix, noticing my reaction grunted a short puff of air in disapproval. “You brought this on yourself, Ivy. I would have been happy to have trained you…. personally. But I cannot ignore your disruptive behavior or your disrespectful attitude. So you’re going on a job tomorrow night with Anaxandra and Evaleen. It’s nothing you won’t be capable of, just a friendly dinner with some colleagues of mine.”
	An escort. I was going to be an escort. 
	“Nix, I am sixteen,” I hissed frantically. My nails bit into the underside of the table, and if I put any more pressure on them, I would rip them off. 
	“Ivy, it’s dinner. That’s all. Trust me, I would not ask more of you than that. Do not forget that you are mine.” His words were a heavy bark of an order before his eyes flickered to Ryder who was setting our drinks down on the table. 
	“Thank you,” I mumbled, ignoring Ryder as he tried to catch my gaze. I couldn’t acknowledge him in front of Nix, not after this conversation, not after what happened in the kitchen. 
	Ryder disappeared back behind the counter but I could feel his concentrated stare as he watched us. 
	“Let’s take these to go,” Nix stood with his coffee. “We have more to discuss.”
	I obeyed. What else could I do? I was still a prisoner. Still chained to this Godforsaken life. 
	I dared a quick glance at Ryder on my way out, before Nix got to the door and held it open for me. I expected to see anger and revulsion staring back. I expected Ryder to be righteously pissed. But instead his gaze was soft and steady. He narrowed his eyes in an expression of support and he tilted his chin down as if to promise that everything would be alright.
	If it had been fury staring back at me the shame would have overcome me, and left me useless.
	But his silent show of support had the opposite affect and instead of soul-eating guilt I could stand up straighter and square my shoulders. I would live through this. 
	I had Ryder, I would be just fine.

Chapter Thirty-Five

	I looked at the clock for the hundredth time in the last five minutes and regrettably noticed only five minutes had gone by. Unable to sit still any longer, I stood up and started pacing the foyer. Smoothing out invisible lines on my campy black satin cocktail dress, I looked up to gauge Anaxandra and Evaleen. 
	They sat unmoving, with legs crossed and hands neatly folded in their laps, like they had done this plenty of times before. Hell, maybe they had. 
	Technically they weren’t supposed to be assets yet, but you couldn’t tell that from the way they shot bored looks around the hotel lobby or sighed impatiently. They looked like pros sitting on the plush bench seat, their slinky stilettos dangling from their toes, their tight skirts riding up just a smidge too high and exposing mile long legs. Eva’s stems were ivory porcelain underneath her silk pink off the shoulder dress. Her long chestnut hair hung down to the middle of her back, straight and sleek. And her lips were glossed and kept strategically away from bangs that slanted over one eye. Ana was just as gorgeous tonight, with her messy blonde braid hanging loosely over one shoulder and her bright blue strapless dress the exact color of her eyes. They were minxy perfection.
	And I was a jumbled ball of nerves. 
	My palms were sweaty, my knees were clammy, my dress felt suffocating and too small. My hair was in this really intricate knot thing on the back of my head, with some faux bangs swept over my forehead, a lot like Eva’s. My bottom lip wouldn’t stop trembling, so I was forced to bite on it which in turn dissolved my lip color a half hour ago. And my hands were convulsing. 
	I was not supposed to be here.
	I had plotted my entire life to get me out of this exact situation. 
	And for opening my big mouth one too many times, I had been punished by my worst fear.
	I absently wondered if Nix knew that. If somehow he had actually seen into my soul and doled out punishment accordingly. Even if he would have taken me two years earlier, it would not have compared to the torture of getting paid to be some old man’s arm candy.
	Sex slave industry. Ryder had been right.
	Only instead of kidnapping and an unwanted addiction to drugs, my mother had given birth to me for the sole purpose of passing on her legacy. Her whore legacy.
	I shuddered as the reality, more than ever before, sunk in.
	“Would you stop?” Eva finally snapped. “You are making me nervous. Just sit down!”
	I let out a rush of breath but obeyed. I sat on my hands to keep them from spreading the shakes to the rest of my body and then stared down at my feet. I tried to remember the words of comfort and encouragement Ryder had whispered to me all day. Immediately this morning he started drilling me about Nix’s “assignment” and because he already knew more than he should, I told him everything. I laid out my evening for him in exact terms, to give him an idea of what I would face and myself peace of mind because someone else, someone normal, wholesome and good, would know where I was tonight. Because he would be concerned about me. Thinking about me.
	“It’s alright, Ivy,” Ana put a comforting hand on my back. She was a little awkward since my dress was backless down to my lowest vertebrae and it was weird with the skin to skin contact of her hand. But she was maternal and sweet and I sank into her tranquility. “This isn’t a real job. Think of it like…. riding your bike with training wheels.”
	I thought about that for a minute and then said, “I was never allowed to ride a bike, training wheels or not.”
	There was a moment of silence before Ana said, “Me either,”
	“Too risky for scars,” Eva added.
	“Ugh, what kind of pathetic childhoods did we lead?” Ana groaned and then all three of us burst into laughter. 
	“How about another analogy that doesn’t remind me of why I’m in therapy?” I asked, but already I felt more relaxed. 
	“Okay, how about this?” Ana seemed to think about it, “You’ve been on dates before? Lots of dates, I bet, right?”
	“Yes.”
	“Well, just think of this like a date. A date with a man you don’t really like all that much, but you still have to finish out your commitment. He’s not going to try anything; he’s not even going to get further than a goodnight kiss. Most likely, these are some business colleagues of Nix that just want to have some company while they’re in town. We meet them, we go to dinner, maybe out for drinks after, and then we part ways. There’s nothing to it. You’ll be fine.”
	Only nothing about this felt fine. I was a junior in high school. I shouldn’t be here with a business colleague of Nix. 
	And I sure as hell shouldn’t be kissing them goodnight.
	The very thought of kissing sent me back to the Delice kitchen with Ryder. It had been a mistake. A horrible, awful, delicious… wonderful mistake. One that would never happen again. 
	But even as I swore to myself I could never slip up like that again around him. I mean, it was all my fault, wasn’t it? I was the one stupidly attracted to him. He was just a guy reacting to his baser instincts. And I didn’t mean because I was a siren. Because he was a teenage boy and I basically climbed him like a tree and assaulted his mouth. But then again, he had even commented immediately on how it had been an experiment. So…
	So, even as I swore all that to myself, I hated, absolutely loathed the idea of cheapening that moment of blissful perfection by kissing a middle-aged pervert goodnight. 
	“This must be them,” Eva commented and sat up a bit straighter.
	Three young guys in expensive, well-tailored suits strolled into the lobby of the hotel looking like they could buy this place with a swipe of one of their credit cards. They were younger than I thought they would be, which initially seemed great, but on closer inspection of all things douchy realized that age might have been better than cocky arrogance in this case. Where an older gentleman would have been considerate and grateful to have my attention, these mid-twenty pretentious a-holes would demand it while filling my head with every vapid self-honoring detail they could think of.
	Still, now that they were here, I felt better. Just a little more relaxed. 
	“Drew?” Eva asked, pretending to be shy. She swiped at the bangs that had fallen into her eye and smiled her award winning I’m-a-saucy-sexpot smile.   
	“Yes,” Drew, the tallest of the three guys smiled hugely in return. He was tan, with overly glossed hair and giant white teeth. While he was handsome in that “Ivy-league-I-do-a-sport-like-rowing” way, he was also so obviously full of himself I wanted to choke on the vanity. “And you are?” 
	“I’m Eva,” she smiled at him again and held his gaze before she extended her hand. “And these are my friends, Ana, and Ivy.” 
	“Blake,” Drew gestured to the guy to his right. Blake stuck out his arm and took Ana’s. He had the long, lithe muscles of a runner; I could see them even through his charcoal suit. His hair was shorter than his friends, closely cropped so there was no expensive product to maintain the stray strands. He was better looking than Drew on close inspection, more mysteriously handsome than classically. Except his eyes were almost too enigmatic, too haunting. They were dark brown and roaming. Even though Ana clearly marked him as hers, his eyes floated over Eva and me, drinking us in with an obvious air of approval.
	“And this is Taylor,” he gestured to the man on his left who reached out a hand to me. 
	Taylor smiled at me shyly, lifting a dark eyebrow as if asking me a question. I held out my hand and he took it in his firm grasp, pulling me forward a little while he shook it. I stumbled in my heels, stepping right into his chest. I looked up at him from under my lashes, hoping to convey that I was embarrassed about tripping. He looked down at me with dull green eyes that weren’t upset at all we were standing so close. 
	Taylor had longer hair than his friends, the top layer falling right to the corner of his eyes. He didn’t seem to notice though, or be bothered by it while he held me close to him, totally invading my personal space. His face was tanned and sculpted, with only a few wrinkles in the corners of his eye and thick ones that crinkled with his forehead. 
	“Nice to meet you, Ivy,” he murmured smoothly. 
	“Nice to meet you, Taylor.” I smiled my practiced smile, the one I turned on when it was necessary to perform. His dull eyes twinkled in return.   
	“Shall we go?” Drew interrupted our too-long greeting. 
	Thankfully.
	Taylor turned skillfully, somehow managing to keep hold of my hand while tucking it into his elbow. He kept a tight grip on it, not a painful one, but one that felt awkward and forced. One that I knew I couldn’t break free from.
	Ana and her date, Blake, led the way to the dining room that was just around the corner and we fell in step last. Taylor trailed a little, separating us from the other two couples.
	“You are truly a stunning creature, Ivy,” Taylor’s words were clipped and enunciated perfectly, like speaking was an art form for him. He didn’t have the smooth, sexy sound that came out of Ryder’s mouth, but I could tell he was used to being listened to. Used to giving orders. 
	“Thank you,” I offered in return and then coughed to cover my nerves. 
	“I love this dress, it fits you perfectly,” he continued. A blush crept up my neck; it was awkward to keep talking about my looks. And although I had been in this place before, with guys my own age, I was not anxious to repeat the experience. 
	“Thank you,” I repeated. “Again.” A moment of silence stretched out between us and I found myself quick to fill it. “So how do you know Nix?”
	Taylor looked straight ahead, his jaw clamping together before he cleared his throat and seemed to put himself back together. “Drew and I run one of his smaller subsidiary companies. We’re originally from the south, but while he is relocated to the Midwest, we’ll be coming up here often to visit.” 
	“Ah, so Nix is your boss?” I clarified. 
	Which was apparently a mistake. Taylors hold tightened on my hand until he was squeezing it roughly, his short nails biting into my skin. “Do you have a problem because I work for someone?” 
	We were stopped in front of a table set for six. The other two guys were helping Eva and Ana into their seats while we stood in front of the table looking like a fighting couple.
	“No, not at all,” I gushed quickly. “I just wanted to figure out the connection, that’s all.” And now I just wanted to get my hand out of his, before he dug his nails all the way to the bone. 
	“Well, now you know,” he ground out bitterly. He yanked my arm from the crook of his elbow and let go of my hand with such force that I fell into a heap on my chair. I hit the seat hard, and bumped my tailbone on the corner before I was able to right myself and sit up normally. I wanted to stand up and slap him for his abuse, but this was part of the job.
	Taking it.
	And so fighting back the tears of frustration and pain, I reached for my napkin and laid it across my lap just so I would have something to do. I ignored looking at the palm of my hand so I wouldn’t have to see the damage he did to it.
	But when I pulled it from the napkin, I noticed the blood smears on the white linen. Not wanting to smear blood on anything else, I dropped my hand to my lap and pressed it into the unsoiled fabric. So what if I couldn’t use a napkin again tonight. I just wouldn’t order salad or anything all that messy, which also kind of sounded fantastic at this point.
	Thankfully dinner was less eventful, at least to begin with. The men, for the most part, ignored us. We ordered drinks- a water for me since I didn’t want to risk being carded, how embarrassing. We picked at our meals and let the men discuss business, politics and sports around us. 
	Anaxandra gave me a sympathetic look when Taylor insisted on keeping his arm around the back of my chair. I didn’t mind his arm so much as his hand kept reaching out and pinching my shoulder whenever I would slouch over. My mother raised me with perfect posture, but occasionally I would lean forward to take a bite of my meal, eggplant parmesan, although I hadn’t touched the noodles. Whenever I would, his hand would subtly clamp down on my clavicle, press down and then pull me back until I was in a posture he approved of.
	It was starting to weird me out. 
	And then when the plates had been cleared, Eva stood up to go to the bathroom. I set my napkin down, careful to hide the blood stains, as if to stand up with her. I mean, wasn’t it a universally known fact that women went to the bathroom together? At the very least in pairs? But before I could stand up, the full weight of his arm was pressed down on my shoulder, telling me to sit tight. 
	I sighed and went back to staring at the table, watching the small votive candle flicker in the dim lighting of the Liberty Tavern. Eventually, the bill was paid, by Taylor, who insisted that this was his treat and we were on our way to after dinner drinks. 
	I had to assume Nix explained that I was underage and wouldn’t be able to go anywhere they carded. Not that I didn’t have my fake ID with me, I did. And not that I wasn’t used to charming my way through bartenders and bouncers, because I was. But warning bells were ringing in my head that I should not at all give another man attention while Taylor arranged for me.
	He did not seem like the type that played well with others.
	The whole underage thing turned out to be a null point anyway, when to my horror, instead of leaving the hotel to drive somewhere else, the men led us over to the bank of elevators. Anaxandra and Eva were cozy and friendly, draped on their dates’ arms, but I remained stiff and cautious next to Taylor. 
	Even though I hadn’t had anything to drink at dinner, everyone else had plenty and Drew and Blake were more than a little tipsy. Ana and Eva seemed relaxed enough; even though I could tell they were still very much in control. 
	Taylor on the other hand… he was clearly on his way to inebriated, but instead of getting loud and goofy, he held on to me tighter, pressed me against him harder. His arm was snaked around my waist with his fingertips digging into my side uncomfortably. And he had me pulled against his body so that my side was pressed firmly against his. It was awkward to walk that way, and I was obnoxiously off balance. 
	Not to mention he reeked of beer.	
	Once we were all piled into the elevator, he gripped me tighter, wrapping his whole arm around my waist and then burying his face in the crook of my neck and collarbone. 
	He made a sexual grunting sound and then inhaled loudly. “Damn, girl, you smell so good.” 
	I mumbled my thank you and then tried to wiggle out of his hold. We were in the back corner of the elevator and even though I wasn’t exactly in danger, I was extremely uncomfortable and I desperately wished Ana or Eva would pay attention to me. They were busy flirting with their own dates, who had gotten very handsy themselves after dinner, so they were dealing with their own problems.
	“I cannot wait to get you alone tonight,” Taylor murmured against my skin. Everything went motionless inside me, petrified with fear. Even my lungs stilled and my heart stopped completely. 
	“No, I don’t think we’re supposed to be alone,” I fumbled through an excuse. “I uh, I don’t think that’s a good idea.”
	“Sure it is,” he growled, digging his fingers into my stomach and wrapping his other hand around my shoulders so I was effectively caged against him. “It’s a great idea. A fantastic idea.”
	I let out a shaky breath and placed my hands over his, the one that was bruising my abdomen. “Please let go. You’re hurting me.”
	The pressure let up, just a little bit. “Say it, Ivy, say it’s a good idea.”
	I shook my head in response, trying to fight back big tears that were threatening to spill. His fingers went back to jabbing my skin and I would have doubled over if his arm across my chest hadn’t kept me locked in a standing position.
	“Say it,” his voice was deadly quiet, just a whisper in my ear. But the ugliest, most dangerous whisper I had ever heard. 
	“I would love to be alone with you,” I forced out. But no. No I did not want to be alone with him. I wanted anything but to be alone with him. His fingers lightened against my stomach and shoulder and I used the moment to take a deep, steadying breath. 
	I had to get out of this. 
	I wasn’t exactly sure what the protocol was here. Last night, Nix made me understand that it was my duty to make my date feel welcomed and at home. I was supposed to be the perfect date, have no expectations on the man and allow him to relax completely with a beautiful woman on his arm. 
	But surely this was not in the contract. There had to be some kind of code that I could use to warn Anaxandra and Evaleen that my date had gone bad. Really bad. 
	The elevator doors finally opened on the top floor and we all poured out of the closed metal box. Drew and Eva started down one way while Blake and Ana walked along with us. 
	“See you in the morning, dude,” Blake called out to Drew who just laughed hysterically in return. 
	I looked over at Ana until I caught her attention. We were side by side with the boys on the outside talking about stupid things above our heads. 
	“I can’t do this, Ana,” I whispered fiercely.
	“He knows not to push further than you’ll let him, Ives. It’s in his contract. You have got to relax,” she bit out back at me. 
	“I can’t. Ana, please, help me get out of this,” I begged as silently as I could. A treacherous tear escaping down my cheek. “Please.”
	Taylor’s pull on me was abrupt and painful as my body slammed back into his. I didn’t know if he had heard me or not, but I felt like a worthless ragdoll against the strength of his arms. 
	Ana must have seen the fear in my eyes or the forceful way he was treating me because suddenly the annoyed look on her face turned to concern. 
	“Hey, why don’t we party together for a while?” She suggested coyly. She turned in Blake’s arms and played with the top button of his open oxford. “It could be fun. Just a few more drinks? Maybe play a little poker?”
	“Strip poker?” Blake asked with hooded eyes.
	“Sure, strip poker,” Ana cooed back. “Ivy loves strip poker, don’t you Ivy?” 
	I opened my mouth to announce how much I loved strip poker, anything was better than being alone with Taylor at this point, but he beat me to it. 
	“That’s alright,” Taylor said in a cold voice. “Ivy and I are ready to be alone. But you two go on and have fun now.” 
	Taylor stopped at the door to his room and pulled out the keycard that would open it. Blake laughed at Taylor’s brazenness and pulled Ana along to his room. She gave me an anxious, apologetic look but let him drag her along. 
	Then the lock clicked open and Taylor was leading me into his room. He didn’t bother to turn on the lights so as soon as the door shut behind us we were lost in complete darkness. His hands had never left me and were now holding me in place, both of them firmly on my waist. 
	“You, you, y-you should know that I’m actually underage,” I stammered. “I’m only sixteen!” 
	My voice was a desperate cry, my breath stuck in my throat.
	“You better be,” he sneered, and then pushed me forward. My foot caught on something, a suitcase or desk leg or something and I stumbled forward and fell on my knees. My hands caught my fall, but then his polished shoe came down hard on my backside, propelling me forward so that I flew face first into the carpet.  The rough, hotel room carpet burned against my face and I cried out in pain and fear. “I wanted someone young, Ivy. You’re exactly what I was hoping for.”

Chapter Thirty-Six

	I laid there on the carpet, hands clutching the short, tough fibers, freaking out. I mean, I had a meltdown like seven months ago, but no emotions I ever felt compared to the fierce terror that momentarily froze me to stone.
He wanted somebody underage?
Nix sent me into this situation knowing that?
Oh. No. 
Oh, no no no no no no. 
I ordered my brain to think of an escape plan, to find a way out of this, and to do it now! But before I could even think about moving, his hand was tangled in my hair and yanking me to my feet. I cried out again at his tight hold and the way he ripped my head back in order to get me to bend to his will. 
	Once I was standing again, he turned me around to face him. He placed his huge palm against the curve of my face very delicately and looked into my eyes like he was a gentle person. The effect wasn’t placating or relaxing but sickening and my chin started to tremble under the intensity of his gaze. His face was bathed in the dim light from the half open curtains behind us. My eyes had adjusted to the darkness of the room, but all I could see were the sinister, evil lines of the man holding me in place. The same hand that was caressing my face so gently suddenly pulled back and then slapped me. Hard. 
	I bit my cheek as a result, the coppery taste of blood mixing with the extra saliva from the desire to vomit. Holy hell, what was going on? How did I get to this place in my life? How did I get here, where someone was beating the hell out of me for their sick entertainment? 
	“You can’t- I’m Nix’s. Nix wants me for himself,” I shouted out in a desperate plea. No desperate wasn’t even the right word. There wasn’t a word that could convey how badly I wanted to get out of here. How afraid I was of this man.
	That threat was met with a harsh, gunshot of laughter. It pierced the dark, silent room like the very sound of it was raping the quiet. I had to get out of here. Now.
	“I’m not going to have sex with you, Ivy,” he taunted me, making it sound like I suggested something inhumanely vile. “Nix wants me to teach you a lesson, to discipline you. Trust me if I wanted to get off by sleeping with you, this would have gone completely different. I’m actually a fantastic date.”
	His explanation caught me so off guard I was rendered completely speechless. This was actually part of my punishment? Nix had arranged this? 
	Cold, frantic dread settled in the pit of my stomach and a hopelessness so strong, so consuming I almost decided to take this willingly and get it over with. What else was there? I had no reason to fight, to try to get out of this. If I didn’t take this punishment now, Nix would just find another way. 
	A huge part of me had been so distressed over protecting my virginity, especially when I thought the man was going to rape me that I hadn’t really given much thought to the other physical consequences that would come out of this. But now that my virtue was safe from this raving lunatic, the rest of the real fears that he brought with him descended on me and the tears started to fall in huge, sobbing drops down my face.
	“Don’t cry,” he growled. “Don’t be so weak.” His palm smacked across my face again and my neck snapped back from the force of it. He caught me with his other hand before I could fall, and his fingers dug into my neck until I felt the hot blood streaming down my neck.
	“Stop hitting me,” I screamed, suddenly so furious, so angry that this man kept assaulting me. Surprisingly I had pictured myself being attacked lots of times before. Usually it was in the context of working for Nix one day far in the future and stopping some sick pervert from making me do something I didn’t want to. In those scenarios I was always this super-powered badass that kicked the ever loving crap out of my assailants. 
	In reality I wasn’t turning out to be the Kung-Fu master I imagined. 
	I took a step back, giving myself some space from him. He matched me, step for step until my back was to the wall, half on solid plaster, half pressed against the edge of the window frame. I tilted my chin in an act of defiance and made myself look for an opportunity to go for his junk. 
	In hindsight and in the profession I was supposed to be planning to go into, a few self-defense classes might have been a good idea. Still, there was promise in good nut-shot. 
	“There really is something special about you,” Taylor’s voice dropped to a husky murmur. 
“I’ve been around sirens before, but it’s like, it’s like you really set something off.” His hands clenched my biceps, almost so that the entire circumference of his thumb to middle finger touched. It was agonizing and chilling but then he let go and started to rub my biceps, up and down with ice cold palms. I just stood their frozen, waiting for my opportunity to strike. His hands moved from rubbing my arms, to my shoulders and then across my collarbone to my neck. “Say please.”
	“What?” I croaked. 
	“Say, please don’t hit me anymore,” he ordered, his voice still deceptively calm. 
	“Please don’t hit me anymore,” I echoed and then braced myself for the hit. 
	He smiled at me, his lips twisting to an unsettling imitation of happiness. His hands wrested at the base of my throat, his fingers wrapping around my neck until they touched in the back. His eyes intensified right before he struck, they went from dull to blazing just a fraction of a second before his hands clamped down and together, choking the life out of me.
	My instant reaction was pure surprise. I tensed immediately and began to scratch and claw at his hands as they shook me by the neck, blocking my air supply. Then there was panic, pure panic. Not the kind that causes panic attacks, which are a slow buildup to the real deal, not even the small kind that shoots razors down your arms and makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck. No real, unadulterated panic that blinds you, that cuts off all rational, clear-thinking thought and thrusts you into the heart of fear. 
	My throat was making these gasping sounds, hoarse and deep bellied but I couldn’t get any air, I couldn’t suck in enough oxygen to get myself under control. And then my vision began to black out completely, first at the edges and then big black spots everywhere I tried to look. I kicked out with my right leg, hoping to land a good solid foot on his manhood, but I was too weak to get control of my appendages and too disoriented to cause any real damage. 
	Until a knock on the door caught us both off guard. First it was light, just a regular tapping sound. Even as I was being pulled under, I could make out the sound and recognized it immediately. Taylor cursed under his breath and loosened his hold on me just a little. And then the pounding was harder, more forceful until it was noisy banging. 
	Another stream of curse words flew out of Taylor’s mouth but this time they were aimed at the door. He released his grasp and I slid down the wall to the floor, pulling the curtain with me so that it was straining on the curtain rod. I watched his footsteps cross the room but I was gasping for breath, barely able to hold myself up in a sitting position. 
	I took big, gulping breaths, willing my heart to slow down, willing my wits to come back. That opened door was my only shot to get out of here, my only shot to escape. As soon as he turned the door handle, I would make my move.
	I started to crawl noiselessly toward him. My clutch lay abandoned on the floor and thankfully directly in my path. I snatched it up on my way. I wasn’t very concerned about the designer bag or anything else in it besides my phone and my credit card if I needed to pay for a cab. My vision was starting to clear, and I had enough big breaths now that I felt the strength to run return.
	Taylor yanked open the door, wider than I think he intended, but he was blind with bloodlust and unable to gauge his strength. And that was all I needed. I burst forward like a sprinter out of the blocks and bull-rushed his side, squeezing under the space just between him and the door. I ignored Blake’s shocked look of surprise at seeing me bolt out of the room like a bat out of hell and just started screaming at the top of my lungs. The sound was piercing but ragged, shrill but scratching and raspy from the choking incident not forty-five seconds before.
	I looked around for the exit, desperate and wild and I just kept screaming. I had to. And even though my lungs were burning and my throat so ready to give up, I willed myself to continue making sound, to fulfill this plan for escape. My vision was still hazy enough that it took way longer than it should have to find the stairs, but all the while irritated guests had started to step out of their hotel rooms to see what the commotion was about. I heard the suspicious sound of a door clicking shut and locking. Without looking I knew it had to be Taylor and Blake hiding away from the crazed girl who would rat them out to the police in a millisecond if they tried to follow me. 
	I leapt down the stairs, sometimes propelling myself forward by the railings so I could take five and six steps at a time. I never looked back, never glanced behind me, I was too afraid. A tiny, but present rational part of my brain announced that not a door to the stairwell had opened since I entered and only the sound of my feet echoed throughout the stairwell but I couldn’t chance it. I couldn’t take the risk. 
	Once I reached the ground floor I tore through the door and to the lobby. I spun in frantic circles, looking for Taylor or Blake or Drew. My eyes moved back and forth, frenzied in their search. They could have taken the elevator down; they could be waiting for me. But if I saw them, I would just start screaming again. I would just keep screaming until I drew so much attention to myself that someone called the police and they carted me away to an insane asylum. 
	I didn’t care. 
	That could never happen to me again. 
That was insane.
I wasn’t. But that was.
Now I just had to figure out what to do. How to get out of here. I dug through my clutch and pulled out my cellphone with violently shaking hands. I scrolled to the first number on my call list, only because he had called tonight to make me promise that if anything went wrong I would call him, and so I did. I called Ryder.
	“What’s wrong?” He asked after the first ring.
	“I need you,” I sobbed. “I need you. You said to call if I needed you and I do. I need you.” 
	People were starting to stare at me, to stop whatever they were doing and just gawk. I didn’t know how I could stop them, or if I wanted them to. As long as they were looking at me, nobody was going to barge down here and take me back up to that room. 
	“I’m outside, I’m waiting for you outside,” Ryder announced. That was the most wonderful news I had ever heard. Ever. 
	With numb feet and shaking knees I walked out the lobby door of the hotel and into the frigid fall air. The end of October was bitingly cold, signaling a snowfall soon and the presence of a looming winter. I was convulsing with shivers but I was certain those would have been happening with or without the cold air. 
	Ryder leapt from his Bronco that he had pulled front and center of the covered driveway. A valet was yelling at him to move his junky POS from in front of the Hilton Hotel, but Ryder ignored him. 
	Instead he sprinted to me, and opened his arms before I was even close enough to fall into them. I threw my arms around his neck and buried my face against his throat. 
	“I’m taking you home,” he demanded and then picked me up like a child. One hand supported my back, the other slipped under my knees and he walked directly to his car. He deposited me in the front seat and then buckled me in before taking my face in both of his hands. “I knew this was bad news. I just couldn’t… I wanted to be here if something went wrong.” He reasoned for his being already present in the parking lot. 
	“Something did go wrong,” I admitted in a croaky, harsh voice as if it wasn’t obvious. “But I’m glad you’re here.”
	Ryder pulled my face down and gave me a sweet kiss on the forehead before closing my door. When he turned around Blake and Taylor were just walking out the sliding doors of the hotel. They noticed me immediately in the passengers’ seat of Ryder’s car and pointed at me. Ryder noticed them too unfortunately and I watched his body physically react to Taylor. It was like I could feel his stare fall on Taylor’s outstretched hand that was bloodied and scratched from when he tried to choke me. I might not have ever gotten a good punch in or hit him back, but scratching his hands turned out to be its own form of karma. 
	Ryder’s whole body tensed when he realized Taylor was the one that hurt me. It was like he followed that bloodied fingertip up the length of his arm and to his face and put the entire night together in his head. And then Ryder snapped. 
	He launched himself forward, onto Taylor and his fist connected with Taylor’s face like a branch breaking off a huge tree during a lightning storm. I heard the crunch of bones from even inside the car and then watched the splurt of blood soil Ryder’s face, hands and chest. My hand flew to my mouth and I gasped against the horror of the moment.
	And then I just watched in trancelike fascination as Ryder cocked his arm back and delivered one punch after another. Ryder tackled Taylor with his initial hit and so with each subsequent one, Taylor’s skull bounced against the hard concrete. There was blood everywhere, flowing in thin crimson rivers. 
	And even though Ryder was the younger man, and maybe not even equally muscled, he had the element of surprise on his side. And revenge. He was a man possessed by rage and retribution.
	I couldn’t move. I couldn’t think. I just watched Ryder take out my pain on the man that inflicted it. 
	Blake tried his hardest to pull Ryder off, but it was like he was a machine with super human strength. Eventually the valet jumped in to help Blake and then the concierge. Someone called the police but by the time the ambulance and police cruisers pulled up, six men had stepped in to restrain Ryder. 
	I stayed frozen in place while Ryder was handcuffed and then shoved into the back of a police car. His hand swollen, mangled and bloodied. But his face was calm, satisfied… justified. 
	And I would be lying if I said I didn’t feel those same emotions coursing through me.
	Taylor was loaded onto a stretcher and the ambulance left immediately with sirens blaring. I barely heard the sound though. After everything that happened tonight, I had finally become numb. 
	I started to float through these events as if everything was happening to someone else. As if someone else’s lungs were burning, someone else had finger length bruises across their neck, someone else had bloodied fingernails and black and blue marks painting their skin. 	
	As if my entire life was happening to someone else. 
	I hated that Ryder was separated from me. Hated it. But in the same moment I also knew I would get to see him again because of what he’d done for me. And if he wouldn’t have stepped in, I could very likely be back in that sick f-ing hotel room, with that sick f-ing bastard. 
	The cops approached me eventually, after everyone in the lobby and some from upstairs, pointed me out. They took my statement, in which the only thing I lied about was that I had been set up on this date by my pimp. I told them instead that I was here with some girlfriends and that we happened to meet them in the lobby.
	And the only reason I lied about that was because nobody would believe me if I told the truth. Nobody would believe I was this stupid, watered down version of Greek mythology and fate had decided that I spend my endless existence whoring it up for the god of the sea. 
	Ugh. It sounded so crazy, even to me! 
	Finally Nix and my mom showed up. The police released me into their care and they loaded me into the back of Nix’s tiny sports car. My feet were propped up on the seat so I had enough room to breathe and my mom and Nix sat in tense silence all the way home. 
	They had spoken briefly to the cops, but all they came away with was a stern lecture on keeping better tabs of their daughter. 
	Their daughter. Like they were this happily married couple and I was a wayward teenager.
	Finally once we were on Farnam and five blocks away from the apartment complex, Nix spoke to me, “Ivy, I had no idea Taylor was so goddamned crazy. I never would have sent you in there, had I known what could have happened to you.” His hands were white as they gripped the steering wheel so impossibly tight and his jaw muscle popped in and out while his teeth ground together in fury. 
	I was shaking, I couldn’t stop. I wondered if I would ever stop. 
	I snorted, it was an ugly, accusing sound, but I was beyond caring. “Save it.” 
	“What did you say?” my mother turned on me, her eyes glittering with anger and some unidentifiable emotion that I didn’t even want to try to name. 
	“Taylor told me this was my punishment!” I screeched. “The minute he had me alone, he told me Nix set this up to punish me! Look at me! Look at me!” My voice was getting louder and louder, but it was still raspy from being choked and screaming so much. 
	And my mother did. She really looked at me. For maybe the first time in my life. Her eyes narrowed and then widened with horror. “Did you really ask him to do that to her, Nix? This was your way of setting her straight?” 
	“I didn’t know he would go this far. I asked him to scare her, I did not ask him to physically harm her.” When I snorted the second time, he grew impatient, “Listen, you’re more valuable to me flawless, so don’t think for a moment that I wanted him to touch your skin or your hair. He was obviously a loose cannon and I take that responsibility on myself.” 
	“Obviously,” I agreed with dry humor. 
	“How could you?” my mother hissed, turning to face Nix.
	“Therapy didn’t work,” he answered simply and then shrugged his shoulder. And that was the only explanation we were going to get. That was the only explanation he had to give. He was in charge of us. He owned us. He could do that to me every night if he wanted to. 
	My mother faced forward again, arms crossed tightly across her chest. Nix dropped us off at the front door of our complex without so much as another apology. That was it, what he said in the car was as good as I was going to get and even after all the trauma of the night I was still going to have to see him on almost a daily basis. I was still going to have to serve him, answer to him. 
	Before I could successfully vomit after that my mother cut into my thoughts, “You’re not going anywhere until those bruises heal, Ivy. I will not have people asking more questions about you. Do you understand? Not even across the street for coffee, alright?” 
	“Alright,” I accepted this. I didn’t want to go anywhere looking like this, like an ad for domestic violence. 
	“And Ivy?” she stopped me before I could get to my bedroom and strip all my clothes and then stand under the hot shower until I had brand new skin. I looked up at her, restraining what was left of my tears until I was in the privacy of my own bedroom. “I’m sorry this happened to you. It will not happen to you again.”
	I just looked at her. I couldn’t even smile in response. I wanted to believe her, I wanted to trust her…. but she was my mom. So after an acceptable amount of stare-down I disappeared into my bedroom and accepted the fact that this was all the sympathy I was going to get tonight. 
	This was my life. I could cry it out in the shower, but the minute I stepped back onto dry ground I had to suck it up and move on.

Chapter Thirty-Seven

	“Are you sure you’re ready for this?” Exie asked from beside me on the sidewalk.
	“Uh, no. Actually I’m pretty sure I’m not ready for this,” I groaned, and then ran my fingers through my hair. Again. 
	“You don’t have to go, you know,” Sloane reminded me. “Your mom said that you could take a few more personal days.”
	“Yeah, right. Except my mom doesn’t really know anything and I don’t want to make summer school a permanent part of the summer calendar. Besides, Tanner might lynch me if I call in to school one more time with the same excuse.”
	“Lynch? Really?” Sloane rolled her eyes at me and then pulled me in for a two-air-kiss hug. We were so mature for our age. 
	“See you girls after school?” I asked as Exie received the same snobby goodbye. 
	“You bet,” Exie answered enthusiastically. “But only if you bring Phoenix down here with you, I have a uh, band I want to show him on my iPod.” 
	“You’re so cute when you have a crush,” Sloane laughed, but I had the feeling it was a sarcastic laugh. “See if you can’t rustle up a man for me too, Ivy. I could use someone who’s not a class-A douche.”
	“Sure thing,” I joked. “I’ll just punch it into my day calendar. Right between chemistry lab and American government.” 
	“Don’t be a smart ass,” Sloane warned and then smacked my ass for extra emphasis. 
	“Bye girls, love you!” I called after them while they piled into Exie’s car and headed off for their posh private school. 
	Even though they never said love you back, it had become our thing. Me saying it, them just…. receiving it. 
	Two weeks had gone by since I was attacked in that hotel room. My bruises were faded, my fingernails had grown back and my voice box had returned to normal. Still images of that night haunted me, terrorized me when I let it. And I never wanted to let anyone I loved, go without knowing it for a single day.
	“Well, look who’s back,” the one person I was making an exception to that rule called from above me on the steps. “Hey there, Red.”
	“Ryder Sutton, when did they let you come back? Rumor has it, you were sent to the big house,” I flirted shamelessly. Ryder had gone to jail, but was soon bailed out by his dad. Taylor never pressed charges and so Ryder was only charged with some minor offenses and sentenced to some community service. 
	Thank God. 
	But then again, part of me knew Nix had something to do with it and the idea of Nix helping Ryder repulsed me. 
	Violently.
	“Fun fact,” Ryder smirked at me. “Tanner blames that on your terrible influence. Turns out your poison to a good boy like me.”
	“Huh, imagine that,” I sighed. “And what do you say to that.” 
	“I say it’s less like poison and more like kryptonite.”  His steady gaze held mine and my heart thumped in my chest, responding to his words, even if I wouldn’t let any other part of me. “Come on.”
	He held out his hand and I took it without thinking. If Ryder was going to hold his hand out for me, I was going to take it. Today. Tomorrow. And any day in the future. 
	He led me beyond the offices and down the main hallway, up the stairs and to the music wing of the school. I finally figured out where we were going when he entered the band room and started walking toward the practice rooms. 
	A few of them were occupied this morning, an advanced cellist, a beginning bass guitar and a struggling oboist. It kind of took all of my effort not to poke my head in and ask the dying duck to give it up! Music was just not in his cards. Not now, not ever. 
	Ryder stopped at the last practice room with nowhere else to go. He held the door open for me and I walked into the small space just as a cascade of butterflies let loose in my stomach. 
	“You’re going to get me into trouble back here. I’m supposed to be in class,” I lectured.
	“Well good thing I’m the office aide and can write you a pass,” he reminded me smugly. “Besides, we need to talk. I haven’t seen you since… Well, it’s been too long. I had to know you were okay.”
	My mother banned all communication from the outside world until I healed. I wanted to believe it was her motherly concern, but instinct told me she didn’t want anyone else remembering what I looked like after they brought me home. 
	It was frightening. 
	I sat down, straddling the piano bench. It was unladylike and completely unattractive, but then maybe that’s why I did it. I wasn’t trying to attract Ryder. I was trying to do the opposite.
	And feel the opposite towards him.
	Until he sat down opposite me, mirroring my pose. He didn’t look nearly as uncomfortable as I did. His long legs fit the piano bench better and okay, his crotch wasn’t completely on display either. 
	Not that mine was, I was wearing jeans after all. But still. 
	“Thank you,” I whispered to him when we were settled. He reached forward and took my hands in his, holding them in the space between us. “Thank you for… thank you for it all.”
	He heard my words and drank them in. “Sure, it’s what friends do.” 
	A small part of me wondered if he was belittling the situation as a defense mechanism, to deflect whatever real emotion there was between us. I thought about it for a minute, but decided to shake that off as vanity. 
	Ryder really was just a good friend. 
	“Mmm, not all friends.” I clarified, not wanting to take away his heroics, both in what he did that night at the hotel and in what he went through to actually befriend me. “Besides, I’m not the easiest person to get along with,” I admitted. 
	He leaned forward so that our bodies were closer, so that our lips were closer. “That is a good point,” he agreed. “It’s a good thing I only like you as a friend.” 
	I looked up to meet his silver-gray eyes, the eyes of someone that was more than a friend, the eyes of someone that didn’t think of me as a friend at all. If the last two weeks taught me anything it was how dangerous my life was, how inescapable my future was and I cared about Ryder way too much to involve him in all my bullshit. 
“It’s a good thing you don’t like me more than a friend,” I breathed out on a whispy breath.
“And why’s that?” Ryder asked, his voice rumbly and gruff. “Why is it good that I’ll never be more than a friend?” He looked down at our entwined hands and then up at me from under dark, sooty lashes. “Explain it to me.” 
Nervousness shot through me, setting every nerve ending on edge, but I sucked in a breath for courage and answered truthfully, “Because you know, you would never really be sure how you felt about me," I obeyed and explained it to him. "I’m all smoke and mirrors. There’s nothing real about me. And you would be caught up in the game. Everything between us would always be fake... forced. Maybe it wouldn’t feel like it to you, maybe you would be convinced that everything we had was real. But it would be the curse, just the curse. You would be in love with something you wanted me to be, not the real me. You could never love the real me," I sucked in a staggering breath and held it; if he told me how he felt, if he admitted more than platonic feelings for me right now, I was gone. To hell with waiting until I turned eighteen, to hell with my mom and Nix and sticking it out for my trust, I would leave tonight. I couldn't hurt Ryder. I wouldn't hurt him. Not after what he did for me. And not just the douche bag at the hotel. He also made me believe in friendship, in caring about somebody and being cared about in return. Falling for me was a trap and I would never involve him in the screwed up soap opera that was my life. 
"Nothing I feel for you is forced or fake," Ryder confessed sincerely. His eyes turned into silver pools in the darkness, promising me truth, promising me authenticity and honesty. His words and the deep, hopeful meaning floated on the air between us; wrapped around me whole and sank into my skin before I could stop them. “Nor will it ever be.”
The urge to flee was so strong and dominant that I thought it would propel me from the bench on its own but I couldn't make my feet move, I couldn't find the courage to leave him. It didn’t exist inside of me. All my lectures, pep talks and hours of reasoning to give Ryder a better life, a life without me fell to the ground in a pile of ashes when presented with the challenge. I chose Ryder. And even though I hoped to keep him as a friend, I knew without a doubt I would always choose Ryder.
A flutter took off in my stomach, flapping wings of reluctant hope and distant excitement. My heart clenched in my chest, an unfamiliar pang of affection I was starting to associate with Ryder. Only Ryder.
"How can you be sure?" I challenged on a whisper, afraid my own voice would prove him wrong.
He smirked at me then, wicked and taunting, "Because I don't like you... at all. You can't fake this level of irritation. You could quite possibly be, the most obnoxious person I’ve ever met," He explained everything on a smile so that I know he was teasing me. 
But that was also how I knew I was in trouble. I was falling for him and in every single way. I wasn’t supposed to. Hell, I didn't even want to, not really. I didn’t want the baggage, or the mess, or the unrequited feelings. But there it was. I was falling. And I couldn't stop it from happening. 
The way he played his guitar... the way he drank his coffee... the way he didn't bother with his hair, the way he laughed at me, the way his silver eyes cut to me from across a room and he could determine in once glance if I was alright or if I needed to be rescued, the way he protected me from everything, even myself... but most of all the way he made me feel when we're together, when we're not together, hell the way he made me feel anything at all... the butterflies and blushing... the rush of it all. Damn it. I'd fallen for the rush.
“You are such a brat!” I rolled my eyes and leaned back, forcing our hands apart. 
“Takes one to know one,” he droned, still making fun of me.
“That was so clever and creative, I’m speechless,” I teased. “So speechless. Did you make that up? How did you get so smart? I want to be like you when I grow up!”
“Alright, smartass, let’s get you to class before Tanner hunts you down and performs the Spanish Inquisition on you.” He stood up, legs still spread across the bench seat and reached for my hands again. 
I gave them to him and let him pull me to my feet. We had another moment of staring into each other’s eyes until he reached down and cupped my face in his hands. “I will never let something like that happen to you again, Ivy.” 
I knew exactly what he was talking about. And so I stayed quiet. Because knowing my life, knowing what Nix had planned for me, I knew there was no way for him to keep his promise. He didn’t react to my silence, or try to argue his way into my belief system. 
But he did close the distance between us and press an utterly heartbreaking, devastatingly sweet kiss to my lips. I just responded. There was nothing else I could do. I couldn’t pull away, or even press back. I just let him kiss me and in doing so, take away some more of my pain. 
“We’re going to get you out of this,” he promised. 
And this time, I didn’t know why or what changed, but I believed him.
“Okay,” I agreed. 
He took my hand again and then led me back to the main upstairs hallway. We walked quietly down the staircase and back toward the office. Just as we moved by the closest classroom to the main office, Phoenix and Chase emerged from the room, carrying that same stupid oversized wooden board. 
“Well, look who decided to grace us with her presence again,” Chase called out sarcastically and then nudged Phoenix in the rib. 
I cringed for a second, even closing my eyes against the awkwardness, but after a moment I realized there wasn’t really any weirdness going on. Chase sounded… just… casual. 
“Ah, the Ginga-Ninja. How are you sensei?” Phoenix did his best impersonation of my Kung-Fu apprentice maybe…? And then turned to bow to me with palms pressed flatly together. 
“Did he tell you, he’s trying to make t-shirts of that?” Ryder laughed. He had dropped my hand a few steps back, but now he threw a friendly arm across my shoulder.
“Obviously that would be awesome!” I laughed too.
Mrs. Tanner stepped out into the hall at the sound of our raucous behavior and frowned at all four of us. “The prodigal daughter has returned,” she grunted at me, leveling me with her angry-wench eyes. “Didn’t I warn you about missing more school? Mr. Costas wants to talk to you about summer school, unless you’re seriously considering doing us all a favor and just dropping out?”
“Sorry,” I shrugged apologetically. That was not an option yet. 
 Mrs. Tanner’s attention snapped up to the three boys that surrounded me, my three friends. “Don’t you boys know better than to hang around Ivy Pierce? She’s no good. She’s going to get you all into trouble.”
Surrounded by this loyal company I barely even felt the sting of her words. 
Ryder looked back and forth between Mrs. Tanner and me and then said in a proud, raised voice, “It’s too late for that. Ivy Pierce may be trouble, but she’s exactly the kind of trouble I’ve been looking for.” 
I smiled at him for sticking up for me again and then my grin grew when Chase started clapping and Phoenix hollered a “Preach it.” 
Things were still bleak. But not nearly as desolate and depressing as they had been.
Besides, tragedies were always easier to face when you had friends.
The Music

While I was writing The Rush, I had the incredible opportunity to work with Andrew James.  He is a truly talented musician, based in Omaha. His sound is this raw blues that draws you in and makes you appreciate the authentic sound of genuinely good music. And because he’s so awesome, he agreed to collaborate with me and this series and write some original music.
For The Rush, he gave Ryder a voice, and a sound and he took the concepts talked about in the book and brought them to life. 
The first song released for The Rush is called I Believe and is available wherever music is sold, iTunes, Amazon, and Spotify. 
The second song, Blackheart, talked about specifically in the book, is also available at all the above distributors! 
If you enjoyed Ryder and Ivy I hope you take the time to check out the songs!!! 


You can find Andrew James on Facebook at The Andrew James

Chapter One

Ping. The sound of an incoming text made me lift my eyes from the dead girl staring unseeingly back at me. Her lifeless body appeared limp, even while she was propped into standing. Her empty eyes glittered an unnatural shade of green.
She was beautiful. 
But by all accounts she’d stopped breathing. 
And if she wasn’t breathing then she couldn’t possibly be living. 
Her flawless skin was still brightened with warmth and the blood in her veins pumped and flowed with that elusive feeling of life; but her soul had fled from her body and her heart stopped beating years ago. 
She was dead.
She was me.
And while I stared into the mirror, examining my carefully constructed outfit, my expertly styled hair and laboriously precise makeup job, I hated her. I hated the girl that was too weak to run away from an existence that would always feel this empty. I hated the girl that was too stupid to think of another way out. 
Ping.
My phone again.
Reluctantly, I picked up the thin phone that was more like an extension of me than a semi-disposable, material object and swiped a prettily manicured finger across the screen. I’d been expecting to hear from Nix, my godfather, or Ava, my mother. Both were waiting for me at the swanky downtown restaurant they’d invited all their friends to for dinner this evening. I was fashionably late at the moment, but any more dawdling and I would make them seriously furious. The car that Nix had sent for me was already waiting downstairs. 
However, the name blinking up at me didn’t make my heart sink to my toes and bleed out through my pores. No, this name pushed oxygen into my lungs and made me feel small stirrings of hope and optimism in the lower part of my belly. 
Ryder Sutton. 
My best friend. 
He had texted to wish me a happy birthday. 
Aw!
I hadn’t talked to him since yesterday morning when he promised that he wouldn’t contact me today. 
I should be angry that he’d broken our agreement; instead, my heart lifted from my feet and replaced itself in my chest. I took in gasping breaths of clean, fresh oxygen and I read his text through glassy eyes.
Happy birthday, Red.
I typed back immediately. Thank you. I was so moved by his thoughtfulness, I didn’t even know what else to say.
Have a minute? I’m downstairs.
What are you doing here?
Stalking you. 
I wouldn’t expect anything less.
But… I have a present for you. Does that make it okay?
That made it more than okay. I grinned at my reflection in the mirror. I no longer felt like a lifeless China doll. I could see the human being staring back at me in the mirror. Her flouncy, mustard-yellow silk summer dress practically glowed against her milky white skin. Her vibrantly auburn hair floated in stylish waves around her dainty shoulders. Her eyes weren’t so unnaturally green anymore, more like soft emeralds that blinked against sooty eyelashes. She was beautiful.
She was me.
Sometimes that beauty manifested as a curse on my future and a noose around my neck. 
But in recently rare moments, I had started to appreciate my face.
That makes it okay. I texted Ryder. 
His reply was quick. Don’t make me wait any longer…
The grin that spread across my face hurt and threatened to crack my head right down the middle. 
God, this boy. 
How could he reach me so completely?
I grabbed my clutch from where I’d thrown it on top of my bed and shut the light off in my bedroom as I exited. I looked around the trendy, midtown condo I lived in with my mother and made sure all the other lights were off as well. I locked up as I left my home and couldn’t manage to wipe the smile off my face even on the elevator ride down to the lobby. 
I bounced out to the elevated walkway that wrapped in a semi-circle around the circular drive thirty feet below. This part of Omaha had been recently renovated from skeevy and outdated to modern and chic. The drive below me used to be the go-to overnight campsite for everything homeless; but once the visionary developers got hold of it, the homeless were no more. My set of condos joined a long line of connecting shops, restaurants and hotels. The condos weren’t larger than two bedrooms, to maintain the childless-couple or wealthy single-person reputation and the retail and culinary spots were all couture and overpriced. 
My mother had never felt more at home than she did in this pretentious place.
I hated every glass door and coveted balcony with the fire of a thousand suns.
There was only one redeeming quality about Midtown Omaha and that was Delice, a coffee shop often likened with Nirvana or Paradise Lost.
Well, at least in my own mind.
I skipped down the steps and met Ryder at his car. He’d stepped out of the driver’s seat and leaned casually back on the passenger’s side of his piece of junk, blue-gray-rust-colored Bronco. 
He absolutely loved his “baby.” 
I threatened to call the EPA on him on a regular basis. 
I walked right up to him without saying a word. Sometimes, being around Ryder was as natural as breathing. He wasn’t affected by my Siren’s curse in any way, and so I could be myself with him without worrying about making him falling in love with me. 
We stood an inch apart from each other just smiling and drinking each other in. He looked especially roguish tonight with his wild hair tussled and pulled from his scalp from the many times he had run his hands through it throughout the day. His light khaki shorts revealed tanned, muscular calves that were toned from his dedication to high school soccer and the fact that he was just the kind of guy that would naturally have those deliciously sculpted muscles. His navy blue t-shirt clung to his chest, making my eyes wander to his biceps and pecs but also reminding me that it was stinking hot out. 
Omaha in July was nothing less than miserable. The high ninety-degree temperatures somehow managed to be suffocating and humid while the terrain of the state remained significantly major-body-of-water deprived. 
Unless you counted the Missouri river. Which I did not.
My supernaturally-enhanced locks had a hard time coping with this kind of torturous weather, but poor Ryder’s miscreant hair never stood a chance. 
I leaned into him and let my fingers trail through his voluminous tangles. “You’re going to make me late,” I told him. He feigned a dramatic look at his naked-devoid-of-watch wrist and then quirked a dark brow at me. “You’re going to make me later,” I amended.
“This will only take a sec,” he promised. 
My Ryder-radar started buzzing with alarm, but I ignored the signs that he was up to something. Maybe this would take longer than a second, but so what? I was in no hurry to get to dinner. And I would so rather spend my time with Ryder.
I wiggled my fingers in front of him. “Give it to me!” 
His lips kicked up into a half-smile and he shook his head with mock-disappointment. “Greedy little thing.”
I just smiled. 
He jerked his head toward the Bronco and ordered, “Get in.”
I watched him walk around the crumpled hood and hop inside. I tried to sort out what kind of present would be waiting for me inside the death-mobile, but couldn’t come up with anything. And so I let curiosity get the best of me and climbed in. 
There was never really a question if I would follow him, just when. And since I was on a bit of a time crunch, I thought sooner was better than later.
His hands tapped out a beat on his steering wheel and when I closed the door behind me he shot me a wicked grin that sent tingles all the way to my toes. 
The thing was… Ryder was not in any danger of falling in love with me… but the same could not be said about my feelings for Ryder. Apart from all the things I loved about him already, like his sarcastic sense of humor, his insane musical talent and his perceptive intuition that called me out on all my bullshit; he was also gorgeous, unaffected by my voodoo and one of the only people in my entire life to be nice to me without any ulterior motive. 
Honestly, I didn’t think I stood a chance.
But I was trying.
I would never intentionally bring Ryder into my vicious world. And I would never deliberately ruin our friendship. It meant way too much to me. 
“I need some air,” Ryder groaned. He turned his keys and instantly cold air blasted me in the face. It felt amazing as it cooled the little drops of sweat that already beaded along my hairline. 
“Mmm,” I groaned. “That feels amazing. When did you fix it?”
“Last week.” His voice sounded a little distant, so I looked over at him and smiled. He was watching me intently, something stormy and electrified flashed in his eyes. I didn’t understand the look or the feeling it gave me. 
Sometimes he would get like this, pensive… a little bit distant. He never talked about what he was thinking and I was too chicken to ask. Eventually, whatever dark thought he dwelt on would pass and we would go back to normal. 
I decided to wait this one out just like all the ones before it. 
I turned back to the vents and said a silent thank you to the air-conditioning gods. The summer had so far been hell riding around in this thing without air-conditioning. Every time we’d gone somewhere together I’d arrived sweaty, frazzled and cranky. 
This was going to be great for my personality points.
“Do you trust me, Ivy?” Ryder asked in a rumbly voice that made my toes curl.
I reached out and tugged on a thick lock of his wild hair. “You know that I do.” Realizing the serious tone to his question, I turned back to him and regarded him carefully. “What did you get me, Ryder?” 
He looked out the windshield and shifted in his seat. One of his hands slipped from the steering wheel to the gearshift and he launched us into motion with a fitful stomp on the gas. He tore out of the driveway while I squealed and slammed a hand on the dash to keep from tumbling to the floor. 
He wiggled his eyebrows at me when we’d finally settled into the lawfully-recommended speed limit. “I got you a get out of jail free card. At least for one night.”
I gaped at him; my jaw came unhinged from my mouth and dangled open stupidly. “You did what?”
“I’m breaking you out, Red. Forget that shit with your mom, I have much bigger plans for us tonight.” He was gifting me freedom- something that I wanted to just embrace and enjoy, but couldn’t. I wanted to throw my arms around his neck and kiss his cheek at the thoughtfulness of his gesture, but I couldn’t. “We’re going on a field trip.”
“Ryder, this is really thoughtful of you, but we both know there is nothing free about me skipping out on tonight. I’m going to pay for this. You know that.”
“Ivy, you’re seventeen today. That’s a big deal.” 
I expected him to continue with his argument… maybe with other points besides the obvious one. 
But that was it. He just topped talking and focused on navigating through traffic. 
“Ryder?” 
His hand reached across the cab and took mine. He interlocked my fingers between his and sighed disconsolately. “They don’t own you, Ivy. They don’t get to dictate every single piece of your life and keep you locked up like a prisoner.”
It was my turn to sigh. “How many times do we have to go-?”
“Then let it go for just tonight, alright? Just be a normal teenager for just tonight.”
His words were like ice picks against my glacial interior; slowly they chipped away at my stone heart until I felt the first risings of hope and anticipation. All I wanted in life was to be a normal teenager. And Ryder knew that. He was using my secret dreams and private desperation- two things he knew intimately to manipulate me into saying yes.
Not that I could be mad at him. 
If anything, this was the most perfect birthday gift anyone could have ever thought up for me.
Still, if I let him get away with this, then I would have more than hell to pay tomorrow. Nix would be livid with me. 
And I really didn’t want to risk what that could mean for me. 
“I can’t blow this off, Ryder! It’s not like a normal thing. There are a whole bunch of people here from out of town. And Nix expects me to…” I trailed off when Ryder shot me a scathing glare. He hated Nix more than any man had ever hated anything. 
“Fine, then I’ll take the blame away from you,” he shrugged.
“How are you going to do that?” 
“I’m going to stop calling this a field trip.”
Frustrated and more than a little annoyed, I demanded. “Then what are you going to call it?”
He flashed me another devilish grin and declared, “Kidnapping.”

Episode One

To Zach,
This would not exist without you.
Just like so many other things.

Chapter One
647 days after initial infection

	Oh, god. 
The smell was the worst. The absolute worst.
It wasn’t enough that I had to pick my way through dismembered and half-eaten bodies, or that at any moment one of them could spring up from the ground and make an afternoon snack out of me. 
It wasn’t enough that I hadn’t had a shower in over a year and a half, hadn’t worn eye liner in even longer than that and my hair was somehow simultaneously disgustingly greasy while frizzing into a perpetual fluff ball. 
Oh no, that would never be enough. My ugly tan work boots were a size and a half too small, I ripped my too big Grateful Dead t-shirt off a very, very dead man, and my jeans…. or what was left of my jeans was the last of my stash from my once excessive closet. 
After all of that- and I mean, the shower alone should have been enough suffering for any living being to suffer through- it was the smell that got to me. 
Putrid, rotting flesh from both the dead that littered the ground around me and the remnants of stench that lingered in the air when the Feeders were finished was what triggered my gag reflex and watered my eyes. There weren’t enough words in the English dictionary to describe my revulsion, or the way my empty stomach flipped with every breath. 
I probably would have puked if I had eaten anything in the last two days. 
The best thing about the Zombie Apocalypse? I was no longer addicted to sugar and caffeinated beverages. 
I wiped my forearm across my sweaty forehead and then re-aimed my handgun in the general area in front of me. This is the point of the story where I’m supposed to tell you what kind of gun I’m carrying, but let’s be real…. Before the end of the world I was a cheerleader at a small town school, where I was the debate team captain and student council secretary. I lived for throwing parties when my parents went out of town, making out with my football captain boyfriend and doing the occasional trip to the homeless shelter where I would put in my monthly two hours of good deeds. 
I’d never even held a gun, scratch that, I’d never even been in the same room as a gun until the world went to shit. Who knew the cure for herpes would turn all those sexual deviants into people-eating, brain-dead, infection-giving assholes? 
Not me. 
The whole phenomenon gave a girl a serious complex about safe sex. 
Not that I was having sex. Or would be any time soon. 
I hadn’t even seen an eligible bachelor in a good six months and it wasn’t like I had exactly been interested when we passed each other with guns raised and a suspicious glint in our eyes. Although there was a sort of mutual give and take between us that could have been considered an instant connection, possibly love at first sight. I let him loot the dead gentleman that had his head literally severed from his body by Feeders, and he let me raid the vending machine offering one bag of Funions that had been smashed into pathetic crumbs.
But then we both went our separate ways and I will never know if he got eaten, turned or found the promised land of Zombie-free showers and espresso machines.
Plus, I was still pining over poor, deceased, Quarterback-Chris.
Just kidding! Quarterback-Chris had apparently been less than faithful to me during our two year relationship and after things with the government, army and general world went to hell, Quarterback-Chris tried to eat me! 
So I did what any loving, devoted girlfriend that just found out she had been serially cheated on by her now Zombie boyfriend would do. I plunged a butcher knife into his eye socket and when that didn’t effectively do the job, I drove over him with my mom’s Escalade until his head detached from his body. 
God, I was glad I held onto my v-card. 
	Could you imagine me as a Zombie?
	Ugh, it made me shudder just thinking about it. 
	A rustling to my left had my gun up, pointed and steady at whatever was stupid enough to make noise in a regular Feeder playground. I only had three bullets left, so this kill would have to be spot on. 
	That was the thing about living in a world in which it was a very likely possibility that you could end up as someone else’s meal before lunchtime, you got to be very good at shooting. Very quickly. 
	Even though the most I knew about my gun was that it was a Berretta from the label on the handle, and the exact kind of bullets it took, .40 S&W- because those were an absolute necessity and I was always on the lookout- I knew exactly how to use it. I knew exactly how to get my bullet from my gun to the perfect dead zone right between the eyes. 
	In fact, it was kind of freaky how good I was at killing things. 
	Well, killing already dead things. 
	It was like I was born for the Apocalypse. No, I couldn’t find a hot shower, figure out how to make food last longer than twenty-four hours and effectively loot a Walgreens that still had hair products available. But I could stay alive. 
	I had an innate ability to stay alive. 
	And in this day and age, ninety-two weeks after the first recovering STD victim bit his doctor and the world fell apart, staying alive was very important.
	Back to the rustling… 
	I slowed my breathing, stopped moving completely and waited for the sound to come to me. 
	One of the first things I learned about survival was that there was absolutely no need to go hunting down trouble. In the world I lived in, trouble would find you soon enough. It was better to cover your back, stay calm and have a loaded weapon ready and waiting. 
	“Reagan, check this out!” Haley squealed in a loud whisper.
	“Holy hell, Hales!” I whisper-shouted back, “I almost shot you in the f-ing head!” 
	She made a resigned grunting noise and I heard her mumble, “Too bad, I bet they have showers in heaven.”
	“We are so not convinced you’re going to heaven,” I whispered back while stepping over a particularly decayed body. 
	Did I say the smell was the worst? I meant maggots. 
	The maggots were definitely the worst. 
	“It wouldn’t matter,” she countered with that distraught, depressed tone even the best of us were known to fall into. “This might as well be hell.” 
	We were still whispering, there was no other option, since Feeders were drawn by sound. And sight, and smell, and light and movement…. But since we were rummaging around a dilapidated department store somewhere in what used to be southern Missouri, we had a little bit of cover.
	The floor was covered with dirt and grime; metal racks that had been looted a long time ago were scattered and broken across the floor and we’ve already discussed the body count problem. We were using what was left of the evening light streaming through the broken window fronts to see and from the sounds of things we were alone, at least on the first floor.
	One of the best things about Feeders was their inability for stealth. They were heavy mouth breathers and tended to stumble over anything in their way. It was like they had their own warning bells. 
	Well, if you stayed alert, kept yourself surrounded by noisy debris and never fell asleep. 
	“What is it?” I asked at the exact same moment my stomach growled. 
	Haley shot me a sympathetic look and shook her head, sending her dark blonde hair bouncing around her shoulders. “Not that.” 
	I sighed, but continued to follow her down a dark hallway. Track lighting hung at awkward angles, the glass long shattered, the bulbs broken since the beginning. The once white walls were smeared with streaks of what I had to assume was blood and dirt. But the stench was less overwhelming here, the air easier to breath.
	“I hit the jackpot,” Haley said excitedly in almost a full-volume voice. We rarely spoke above a whisper so I was taken aback at first. I had almost forgotten what her real voice sounded like.
	“In?” 
	“Jeans!” She turned back to look at me over her shoulder, giving me a goofy smile and waggling her eyebrows. 
	Now this was a jackpot. 
	We exited the hallway straight into the Junior’s section. The racks were less-knocked over in this part of the store and still stocked with clothes. Racks and racks of fall fashions from almost two years ago filled the floor.  A discount shoe rack with boxes of clearance items sat in one corner and in the middle of the department was a makeup counter.
	An f-ing makeup counter. 
	Eyeliner!!!  
	At this point, you might be wondering who I could possibly want to look good for. And that is a valid question. But it wasn’t like that. 
	In the last two years, I had been forced to live as a homeless, basically-starving person, with shredded, usually-covered-in-blood clothes, no shampoo, let alone conditioner and perpetually covered in dirt. I was tired of looking ugly. 
	Tired of it! 
	I just wanted a little bit of makeup, just something to make me feel like the world hadn’t completely blown apart in the prime of my life and left me a wandering vagabond. 
	I had given up on finishing my education. I had given up on feeling guilty for killing what used to be human beings. I had given up on being happy again, living in a house, having a hot shower and whatever dream I had imagined myself living out. I had even given up on finding love.
	Hell, I had given up on finding sex. 
	I just wanted to look anything but tired, weary and worn out. 
	Was that so much to ask?
	“Welcome to the promised land, my friend,” Haley whispered proudly before turning to a rack of longs-sleeve tee’s. 
	I had a theory about why this section of the department store was untouched and it went something like this. In the beginning of the end, families protected their young. If you were a teenager, you were home, holding down the fort. Especially if you were a girl. The whole raping and pillaging thing didn’t apply to most kids that still had parents around. And if you were young and stupid enough to try to make it in a world where sane people spent their time looting, overthrowing local government and shooting at any and every potential threat, chances were your inexperience and still rose-colored-glasses-of-the-world made sure you ended up dead. 
	How Haley and I survived not only the Feeders, but the crazed militia, living on the street and all the old man creepers that thought we would make fantastic sister wives was a straight up miracle. We got lucky in the beginning by sheer location. Small town, middle-of-nowhere Iowa finally paid off. 
	Well, except for the whole Quarterback-Chris thing. 
	But it wasn’t like we didn’t get Feeders in Atlantic, Iowa. Of course we did. Herpes was a worldwide disease. Everybody got Feeders. Even remote islands in the middle of Oceans. If there were people there, then there were people having sex. And that meant STDs. Why? Because men would always be sluts. Always.
Was I a little bitter about Quarterback-Chris? Hell, yes.
Did I not mention he tried to eat me? 
	My parents were killed by Feeders. Hale’s dad was killed by a Feeder. I was almost killed by a Feeder. 
	They were everywhere.
	What we did have was an absence of a lot of people and an abundance of guns. Thank you farmer Fred for your once unnecessary stash of ex-military contraband.
	I hopped over the counter, sliding my butt across the filthy glass. My already-grimy jeans smeared a dust coated path the size of my hips. I landed on the pads of my feet and my toes were smashed even worse in my small hiking boots, but it was a soundless landing I was kind of proud of.
	I had the reflexes of a cat, thanks to living every minute of my life expecting an attack. If the world ever got its f-ing act together and cleaned up this mess, I imagined they would make a movie of my life about the whole Zombie thing. I’d obviously be played by that hot brunette from the Vampire Diaries in which I would run around in a sexy Cat Woman suit, totally playing the super hero. 
	I opened the cabinets behind the makeup counter and slipped my backpack off my shoulder. Inside my hiking pack everything was orderly and neatly packed for maximum space and easy access. But I didn’t have time for that now. I would reorganize everything later. 
	I started swiping handfuls of products into my bag, not caring about color or usefulness. This was what Haley and I called the Grab and Go- get as many supplies as we could now, as fast as we could, then leave the scene before either Feeders or protective townsfolk happened upon us. We could sort it out later. Without even having to discuss it with Haley, I knew she was picking out shirts and jeans for me and she knew I would cover her with whatever I could find. 
	After makeup, I hit up the clearance shoes, except there wasn’t anything hiking, nature resilient or weather-proofed. Haley’s shoes were in good condition actually, so I didn’t bother debating over her. She was tiny by nature, not just because we only ate every three days and probably had scurvy since we were lacking serious vitamin c. She barely cleared 5’3, and her feet were average size enough that she could double up on socks and fit almost any pair we found.
	I had clown feet even for my 5’8 frame and most the time found myself searching the small-feeted men. There were plenty of feet to choose from, but we didn’t run across the right kind of shoe very often.
	Like right now. There were a pair of tennis shoes that I could upgrade to, and they were my size. Or should I stick with the weather-proofed boots that would protect my feet from the elements? 
	The other part of the debate- tennis shoes were much lighter than these things, easier to walk across country in and much, much nicer to run in. 
	Still, I had to protect my feet. And I definitely didn’t want trench foot. Not that I knew what trench foot was…. but I knew it was a big deal for everyone on Band of Brothers- my go to reference for everything survival. 
	“Get the shoes that fit,” Haley said from across the room while digging through every style of jeans. 
	“You’re right,” I agreed. A shoe that fit had to be infinitely better than what I was wearing now. I toed off my boots and ripped off my socks. There was a whole rack of socks near the checkout counter, so I grabbed handfuls of them and stuffed them in the bag, saving a crazy-patterned neon pair for now. 
	“Sweatpants?” Haley asked from a new rack. 
	Moving quickly was essential to our survival, and we had honed this skill in order to stay alive. “Absolutely,” I agreed. Jeans were practical and resilient, but there was nothing better than a pair of yoga pants when running for your life. 
	As I moved on to underwear-which might as well have been gold at this point- the light grew dimmer in this department. We were already squinting and stumbling around in the dark, and I knew we had been here too long. I had a flashlight that hadn’t run out of battery yet, but I really didn’t want to use it if it meant drawing the attention of wandering Feeders. 
	“Haley, we need to go,” I whispered harshly. 
	I heard her zip up her pack and shoulder it, but I could barely make out her form anymore. We’d learned to act as soon as a command was given between us. There was no time to hesitate anymore, so by the time I’d slipped my heavy backpack on again, she was already moving toward the exit. 
	One of the weirdest parts of the Apocalypse was the quiet. I couldn’t get used to it. Back in my old life, before the infection, there seemed to always be noise around. Cars on the highway, music from my iPod, airplanes overhead, my parents talking at me; there was always something in my ear. Now, there was nothing, no background elevator jazz to soothe us while we shopped, no other shoppers bustling around and bumping into us. The only sound to break up the silence was our careful footsteps and the heavy mouth-breathing from a Feeder in the next room.
	Oh shit!
	I grabbed the handle on Haley’s backpack and tugged her backward. Her head whipped around and she opened her mouth to probably ask what the hell, but I held my finger to my lips and motioned with my head toward the way we just came from. It took her a second, but as soon as she heard the panting and wheezing in the next room she was instantly game for my plan of retracing our steps.
	There was plenty of food for the bastard in the room he was in now, but I knew he would be able to sniff out our live, fresh flesh in the next two minutes and that was like the difference between prime rib and an old, moldy hot dog. 
	Best case scenario, he was going to lick the hot dog first, and come back for it later, after he ate his prime rib. 
	Which was me. 
	I stepped carefully until we were back in the Junior’s Department, always keeping my gun trained on the direction of the Feeder. Haley stood a little bit behind me, her gun aimed to the left where this area opened up to the children’s section. 
	“Son of a bitch,” she breathed on a strangled whisper. 
	A quick glance toward the direction her gun pointed, showed the glowing red eyes of two different Feeders. That was the signature of the last stage of their digression into Zombie-hood: first came the cravings for flesh, then the heart stopping semi-death, the disgusting process in which their brain still worked, but their bodies started to decay and then the tell-tale red eyes, which were basically a sign that all humanity was lost, they were stronger, didn’t feel pain and only craved brains. 
	Basically, this sucked. 
	They could smell us, but couldn’t see us yet, and so they were still trying to pinpoint us before they attacked. Unfortunately, we could also smell them. What really sucked was that there were at least three of them, these two and the one munching away on all that delicious dead flesh. 
	They weren’t exactly pack animals, and usually they traveled- wandered aimlessly- alone, but if they ever found themselves together it was like they shared a hive brain or something. They acted as a team, without speaking or seemingly communicating, and once their eyes were red they were a hundred times harder to take down. 
	Our backs were against the wall, literally, and I wasn’t exactly sure how we were going to get out of this one. 
	I glanced over my shoulder again and noticed for the first time an exit toward the corner of the room. A discounted clothing rack had been pushed up against it, and it was barely visible in the almost completely-dark room, but a reflected Exit sign was still pasted on the top. 
	As quietly as I could, I whispered, “Behind us, Hale. An exit. Lead or Cover?” 
	Haley let my noise settle before she answered. The Feeders had already started moving toward us. Despite every Zombie movie I had ever seen, the real life versions were not exactly the dumb and easy to kill version of walking corpses. They were hunters, fast and intuitive. While humanity still had the advantage of a rationalizing, fully functioning, not-addicted-to-living-flesh advantage, they weren’t exactly a helpless opponent. 
	“Cover,” Haley finally whispered back.	
	And with her blessing I turned on my heel and sprinted for the door. I could feel her behind me, but out of experience, I knew she was keeping her gun trained on the Zombies that were now chasing us down to make snacks out of our innards. I gave up on being quiet and threw anything that stood in my way. 
The trip across the room took maybe five seconds, but it felt like the longest run of my life. I could already hear the Zombie from the other room tearing his way to join his friends. My heart was hammering in my chest, my vision focused only on the exit and my ears trained to listen for any surprises.
	As soon as they were in my reach, I grabbed onto the tightly-packed, discounted clothes and went to toss the rack, but it only swayed. Something was holding it to the ground.
	Pure panic prickled my blood and my eyes watered immediately from the stress of the situation. I heard Haley’s gun go off behind me, but because the mouth-breathing was so loud I knew she had missed.
	That meant she had four bullets left in her magazine. 
	Shit. Shit. Shit. 
	I pulled again on the rack of clothes and this time it moved an inch. I realized then that it was tethered by something on the ground. While Haley shot off another bullet, I dropped to my hands and knees and felt blindly for whatever was holding onto the base of the rack. Once I found the thick rope that was tied to the base, I whipped out my pocket knife I kept in the pocket of my pants and began cutting at the rope frantically. 
	Another shot from behind me and one of the Feeders dropped to the ground. Good shot, Hales. There were still at least two more Feeders left, and I could hear more commotion from the front entrance. All these shots were probably drawing everything out there in here. 
	I finally got through the rope, but as soon as the slack was gone, something huge and clanging crashed to the ground just on the other side of the door. It sounded like pots or pans and a whole bunch of breaking glass. 
	Shit!!!
	I didn’t have time to process that right now, so I stood up, effectively shoved the rack out of the way and went for the door handle. Another gun shot behind me and another Feeder dropped to the ground. 
	I lunged for the door handle, and turned it desperately. And nothing.
	It was locked.
	“No!” I screamed, not caring about the noise level at this point. 
	Haley’s last bullet exited her gun and the last Feeder felt the hit and fell to the ground directly behind me. These guys were dead, but there were who knew how many now headed toward us. Haley was out of bullets, and I had three left. 
	And our only exit was locked. 
	“What are you waiting for, Reagan. Let’s get the hell out of here!” Haley’s back was still to me as she faced her now empty gun at the hallway, just waiting for the rest of the Feeders to follow the sounds and find us.
	“It’s locked! Damn it!”
	Completely panicked, I yanked on the handled and then kicked it with my new shoe. Nothing happened. The door stayed firmly locked, stubbornly unmoving. This was definitely worst case scenario. 
	And not ten minutes ago I had been really excited about all that eye liner and a new pair of jeans.
	This was so not how I was going out. I’d survived Quarterback-Chris, the death of my parents and almost two freaking years of living as the most depressing version of Mila Jovovich in Resident Evil ever. 
	“Open, damn it!” I screamed at the door, giving it another kick with my foot. 
	Only this time, my foot didn’t connect with anything. The door wrenched open and my body flew, following my foot, through the empty space I wasn’t expecting. I fell straight to my hands and knees in a huge pile of glass shards and broken ceramic. I felt the thick chunks of debris dig and slice through my skin immediately. My jeans would be completely irreparable after this and, with my luck, as soon as I was able to stop bleeding, I was for sure going to get gangrene. 
	What the hell? 
	“What the hell, Reagan?” Haley practically screamed at me as soon as she was through the doorway. She slammed the door behind her and braced her body against it; meanwhile, I was still doggy style in a pile of glass I was too afraid to stand up from.
	The damage was going to be annoyingly excessive. 
	Before I could answer her though, I heard the signature click of a bullet being loaded into the chamber. More dread slithered through my body; other humans were just as deadly and dangerous as Zombies these days. And apparently we were trespassing.
	“Don’t move,” a deep, masculine voice ordered in a quiet, steely tone. 
	“Out of the frying pan,” Haley mumbled resignedly. 
	“And into the fire,” I finished for her. 
	I would never complain about eyeliner again.

Chapter Two

	“You, drop your gun and put your hands in the air,” the obviously male voice ordered Haley roughly. 
	Another click of a gun from behind us and I started trying to count shoes from my position on the floor. Blood pooled around my palms and knees, making the glass-littered ground sticky and wet. The stairwell was almost completely dark though, except for some kind of lamp that was shining from the top of a stairwell, it cast long, shadowy streaks of light down on us, but kept every face hidden in darkness. 
	I heard Haley’s gun drop to the floor with unnecessary force behind it, crashing into the glass and ceramic. “Fine,” she growled. “But, it was empty anyway.”
	A snort of laughter sounded from the guy in the back and I almost smiled. God, Haley could be feisty- which was definitely a good thing when we found ourselves sandwiched between zombies and armed men that probably hadn’t gotten consensually laid since the outbreak. 
	“Now you,” the man addressed me. I felt more than saw his gun swing in my direction. “Stand up slowly.”
	“Do I have to?” I winced, thinking about my injured hands and knees. I was putting pressure on them now, so even though there was pain, I had staunched any chance of a river of blood. If I stood up, and let my hands hang limply in the air, I would be covered in Zombie-food in no time. Mostly I was worried about being sticky for the next couple of days. Blood was a pain in the ass to scrub off, especially if there wasn’t clean water around. “I’m bleeding here.” 
	“You’re bleeding?” the guy asked dryly.
	“I’ve been booby-trapped,” I drawled. 
	Haley chuckled, and nudged me with her foot. “She’s been booby-trapped.” 
	That made me giggle, too. Apparently, the stress of our situation was not enough to dampen our sense of humor. 
	“We have guns,” the guy with said gun explained unnecessarily. “This isn’t a joke.”
	“But you’re not going to shoot us,” Haley argued. 
	“I’m not?” 
	“We’re hot. You’ll at least rape us first,” she explained on a hysterical giggle.
	“At least,” I echoed, my laughter bouncing off the floor. “Just don’t give us herpes.”
	“We’re not going to rape you!” The guy in the back defended, sounding absolutely disgusted by the idea. Well, that was a good sign. 
	“Are you two high?” the first gunman asked incredulously.
	This only caused us to laugh harder, until a hand hit the outside of the door aggressively. We all jumped at the sound. Another fist came down on the heavy metal door, just to the left of Haley’s head. And then another. The Feeders had arrived. 
	“Up, now. We’ll take care of the bleeding upstairs,” I was commanded from above. 
	I knew I didn’t have a choice at this point. One Feeder might not be able to break down the door, but the incessant pounding would draw others and there was no telling what an entire horde of them could do. 
	I stood up slowly, flicking the loose pieces from my kneecaps and heels of my hand with the tips of my fingers. I couldn’t close my palms or straighten my legs completely, so I had to stand at an awkward angle, allowing the blood to run and drip from every cut. 
	“Those look bad, Reags,” Haley hissed, concern entrenched with every syllable. Zombies didn’t faze her; guns made her laugh, but my deep cuts were enough to get her to take this seriously. She was a good friend. 
	“I’ll be Ok,” I assured her.
	“Let’s go,” the guy with the gun ordered before she had a chance to say anything else. 	
	We followed the direction of his pointed gun and marched up the stairs. He pushed Haley in front of me, which was a travesty since my gun was tucked into the back of my pants. She would have known that and if she would have been behind me she could have grabbed it.
	I hobbled up the stairs, still crooked at the knees. I took careful steps, gingerly holding onto Haley’s hand as we went. The stairs were just as covered with broken glass and pieces of everything else. The farther we got up the stairs, even Haley had to duck because all kinds of cookware and gardening tools were hanging from the ceiling. A human would have had to have their wits together to bob and weave these traps, but Feeders were single minded and stupid. Maybe it wouldn’t have been enough to impale them or maim them, but it would make a lot of noise if someone came running up these stairs knocking pans, rakes and shovels together. 
	I started to get the impression that this was a permanent settlement for these guys. A nervous tingle ran down my spine when I wondered how many of them there actually were. 
	In our travels, Haley and I had come across a few scattered settlements. We were always careful to scope them out first, doing due diligence with our scouting. Some settlements included women and even children; those were generally safer even while outsiders made them understandably nervous. If we weren’t carrying the disease already, we could expose them to others who were, or deplete them of their coveted water and food supply. We always tried not to take anything from settlements. If we didn’t want anything other than a place to sleep for the night, they tended to trust us more. 
	Other settlements were not nearly the safe-haven though. Militia type groups set up outposts all over the US in order to protect what was theirs, usually only enlisted with men. Whenever a group of just men got together it was like they lost millions of brain cells in the presence of all that testosterone. They became total cavemen, dangerous and unpredictable. They were just as deadly as Feeders, especially to women. 
	Especially to a couple of young virgins, traveling by themselves…
	We were like the new Fountain of Youth. The white unicorn. The freaking Holy Grail.
	If I wasn’t so worried about becoming a Zombie, I would have just given up the v-card months ago. Not that the Zombie gene was passed on like an STD, but they felt very closely related. It was like, die a virgin or get herpes, and then if I got herpes I would obviously seek out the cure, because, uh… yuck, then because of the whole Zombie-itis thing I would definitely become a Feeder and the whole event would have been pointless. 
	Ok, that was all fiction. 
	I didn’t have to become a Zombie just because I had sex. 
	But what happened to love? And commitment? Was that all gone just because I happened to live during the Apocalypse? 
	I had a serious boyfriend before the world went to shit and he tried to eat me- and not in the sexy way. We planned this whole after prom experience, there would have been rose petals on the bed and whispered I love you’s. Even if he was a cheating asshole, that still sounded better than meeting up with a stranger and losing it on the dirty floor of some abandoned Wal-Mart. 
	Plus, who knew about safe sex these days? I didn’t exactly come prepared with baby-preventing merchandise. And I was so not filming Teen Mom Zombie Apocalypse Edition. 
	We passed the spotlight when we rounded the corner and were ordered up the next flight of stairs. I sighed at the thought of struggling up another set of steps, but marched on, knowing I didn’t have a choice. 
	“Do you need some help?” The guy in the way back asked quietly. 
	“Uh, I’ll be Ok,” I replied quickly. Maybe it was a sign of the times, but where the hell had that come from? I wasn’t exactly used to chivalry, and the very idea of it completely freaked me out. 
	“It’s just up at the top of the stairs,” the main gunman explained. I ignored the softening of his tone. I had to assume this was going to go one of two ways, Haley and I were about to made into sister wives for an entire community of vigilante men that had forgotten how to give the girl hers first, or this was an execution and they didn’t want blood and bodies anywhere near where Feeders could find a way into their hidey-hole. Neither of those options appealed to me.
	At the top of the stairs, the guy from the back walked past, gun held at his side, and knocked on another heavy steel door. The door was opened and a stream of light flooded the stairwell. I blinked against the brightness my eyes weren’t used to and dipped my head. 
	Following Haley’s feet, I shuffled inside the third floor of the department store and heard the door slam and lock behind us. The sound of sliding, heavy furniture could be heard behind me and eventually, when my eyes adjusted, I turned around to see four cash register counters lined up in front of the exit. It wouldn’t keep out a mob of Feeders, but it would be enough to stop the lone wanderer, or even a group of ten or fifteen. 
	My mouth dropped as I let my gaze take in the rest of the space. These guys had commandeered the entire third floor. This was an older style department store, in what had always been a small town, so there wasn’t an escalator in the middle of the floor, but there was a set of stairs that had been built over with heavy steal pieces that had been welded together in a makeshift strong box. The elevators off to the side had been boarded up, too, with steel and metal. From a quick glance around, the only exit or entrance even accessible was the doors we just came through. 
	Couches and beds had been set up in sections; rooms were made from curtains hanging from the ceiling. A kitchen of sorts was also set up with a camping grill, a basin for water and several coolers that probably contained dried food. There were three other guys hanging out, guns hanging limply from their fingertips while they surveyed us with suspicious eyes. 
	Haley gave a flirty wave that I knew she didn’t mean. If any of these guys came near her with bad intentions she would detach their manhood from their bodies with her teeth. 
	“What did you find, Hendrix?” The oldest of the guys- probably mid-twenties- asked from his perch on the back of a plaid couch. He was tall, his body stretched out as he leaned against the back casually. Attractive in that I-can-totally-pull-of-the-dirty-scruffy-and-rugged-look-as-if-I-was-doing-a-magazine-cover. His facial growth was sexy as hell; his shaggy, dirty blonde hair, chopped and straight, fell around his eyebrows and collar. He was stupidly handsome for the end of the world. It wasn’t fair. 
	The difference between girls and boys was that boys could go days without a razor and they looked better. I went days without a razor and people started reporting Big Foot sightings. Damn the male race and their immunity to hygienic upkeep. 
	“Girls,” Hendrix huffed behind me. “They were shopping.” 
	Haley snorted at the insinuation we were just shopping for leisure. “We were stocking up on supplies,” she bit out. 
	“Makeup?” Hendrix scoffed pointedly at me. 
	“Just a little eyeliner,” I mumbled a bit dejectedly.
	“Yeah?” Hendrix asked dramatically. “Is that eyeliner going to help you stop bleeding?” 
	“No, but you could,” I shot back quickly. 
	Hendrix opened his mouth to say something, but the other one cut him off with an authoritative, “She’s right. Help her get clean before the Feeders get a scent of her fresh blood.” 
	I flaunted a haughty look and waited for Hendrix to lead the way. In the light, I could now take him in. He was as steady here as he was downstairs, cool and completely collected. He was tall, too, at least eight inches taller than me, with a muscular but lean frame. His hair was just as shaggy as the other guys but a deeper blonde color, almost brown but not quite. His darker half-beard was more trimmed than the first guys and hid full lips that if I had to guess, were perpetually pressed into a frown. Hendrix, in the short time I had known him, was clearly never the life of any party. He was like the black hole that sucked all the fun out of the room. 
	Not that there was a whole lot of fun happening these days. But proverbially speaking, he was the party pooper. 
	He led me over to the kitchen area and directed me to sit on a tall bar stool. I glanced over at Haley who was now sitting awkwardly on one of the cashier counters that blocked the exit. She gave me a small wave and a shrug of her shoulder. So far, no raping and pillaging. 
	I turned my attention back to Hendrix when he gripped my hand and started to pull out one of the larger pieces of glass imbedded deep in my palm. I sucked in a sharp breath and blinked away the tears of pain. 
	“That’s some defense system you got down there,” I hissed through the throbbing pain. With the biggest piece of glass dislodged from my palm, Hendrix grabbed a bottle of rubbing alcohol and poured it on the gushing wound. I winced at the searing pain and squinched my eyes shut. He started patting it gently with a cloth and I relaxed a little at the applied pressure. 
	“Most people that come through that door are invited,” he explained in his no-nonsense, rough way. 
	“Are they also being chased by Feeders?” I asked with as much sarcasm as I was capable of under the circumstances. 
	“Hold this,” he ignored my question and pressed my fingertips against the soft towel. I opened one eye to watch him pull up another bar stool and sit down. He was close to me, so that our knees were pressed into each other and he could hold my hand against his body. His longish hair fell over his eyes and he shook his head to the side to get the stray pieces out of his field of vision. 
	I was slightly mesmerized by his movement until he removed the towel and pulled another shard of glass out of my palm. 
	“These are bad,” he commented without any emotion. 
	“I know,” I grimaced. 
	“Bruce Lee,” he mumbled while pouring more alcohol into the wound.
	“What?” 
	“You looked like Bruce Lee with your foot flying through the door,” he explained but there was absolutely no humor in his voice. 
	A surprised giggle bubbled up inside me and I couldn’t stop it. “You could have warned me you were going to open the door.” 
	“I didn’t know if you were a friend or an enemy.” He lifted his eyes from my wound to meet my stare. He had intensely blue eyes that shimmered they were so serious. 
	I cleared my throat, feeling exposed under his weighty gaze. “Fair enough,” I finally squeaked out. 
	He worked in silence for a while, pulling pieces out carefully and then cleaning the cuts properly. When he was finished with my right hand, he bandaged it expertly and then moved on to my left. 
	“This is quite the set up you have here,” I commented while keeping my eyes on Haley who looked bored, still positioned on the counter. The rest of Hendrix’s band of merry men stood conferring with each other in a far corner.
	“Yep,” was all he said in reply. 
	“Have you been here since the beginning?” I pressed. I didn’t know what these guys were going to do with us, but right now they held all the cards. We were pathetically at their mercy. I wanted as much information as I could get, even if it couldn’t help me. I had to believe Haley and I were competent enough to get out of this mess should they mean us harm.
	“Nope,” Hendrix offered helpfully. 
	“So how long then? You have a serious utopia up here; I’m surprised there aren’t more of you.” I chewed my bottom lip thoughtfully as I took in their dried food supply to my left and the soft, comfortable beds that were curtained off into bedrooms. They also seemed to have plenty of clean water and medical supplies. 
	“We don’t trust outsiders,” he growled out.	
	“Oh, like me?” I rolled my eyes. “That works out great since I don’t trust you either.” 
	“You shouldn’t,” he promised quietly.
	“Wow, you sure know how to make a girl feel welcome.” 
	“It doesn’t matter; you’ll be gone in a few hours anyway.” He kept his eyes firmly on my hand while he expertly cleaned my wounds. 
	I gulped and then whispered so Haley couldn’t hear, “Like you’re going to kill us?” 
	“What?” His eyes snapped up to mine and he actually looked offended that I would think that about him. “We’re not going to kill you. We’re going to send you on your way. We don’t want you here. I already told you, we don’t trust outsiders.” 
	Not that I was expecting some kind of white knight declaration or anything, but even false hope would have felt great at this point. “But I’m a woman,” I pointed out obviously. 
	“Yep,” he reverted to his one word answers. 
	“Aren’t you going to rape me?” I demanded a little put out that the thought hadn’t even crossed his mind. 
	“What? Do you want me to rape you?” He asked sounding more appalled than before when I thought he should kill us. Good for him, a single guy at the end of the world with standards. I almost laughed out loud. That concept was about as fantastical as the young virgin.
	Yet, I was here, so….
	“Obviously not, it’s just….” I trailed off, feeling like a total douche for assuming he was as bad as everyone else out there. I cleared my throat, “So how did you guys meet?”
	“Online dating,” he mumbled dryly. 
	“Oh, like before? That makes sense then. It’s actually kind of sweet you still have each other through all this craziness.” It was like an ah-ha moment. They were gay. 
	“I was kidding,” his eyes snapped up to mine again and flashed with annoyance. 
	“I’m not judging you,” I quickly said. “I think it’s great. Seriously!” 
	“We’re not gay,” he growled. “We’re brothers.” 
	I snorted a laugh and then dissolved into laughter. “Don’t ever try to be a comedian.” I shook my head at him, watching as his irritation grew deeper. “In fact, maybe don’t ever attempt a joke again.” 
	He scowled at me for a few more seconds and then finished the dressing on my left hand. Once that was done he motioned for the sleeves of my shirt. 
	“I’m wearing a tank top underneath; I can just take this off,” I gestured uselessly with my bandaged hands to my long-sleeve tee. “Uh, do you have a knife? You could just cut it off.” 
	“You trust a stranger with a knife?” he asked like I was the most naïve person on earth. 
	“You’ve had plenty of opportunity to do what you want to me. I trust a stranger that knows how to take care of open wounds,” I said seriously. And that was true. He was surly, cranky and had zero sense of humor, but he wasn’t trying to hurt me. He was trying to help. And those kinds of people didn’t really exist anymore. 
	He pulled out a butterfly knife from his back pocket and went to work cutting my t-shirt off without damaging the tank top underneath. With quick, confident moves, my filthy, bloody shirt was discarded with the rest of the bloody towels and I was left in my black cami; my neon-green demi-cup bra poked out from underneath- in the last big town we were in, Haley and I raided a Victoria’s Secret. 
	I watched Hendrix’s eyes flare to life at the sight of so much of my exposed skin. A heat burned in my belly that I did my best to ignore. This was like that game, if we were the last two people on Earth…. Uh, the answer for Hendrix would have been a hell yes, before. But things were not that simple and I really liked to believe there was more to me than a desire to get laid; like surviving a world full of Zombies, for one. 
I kept my elbows tucked against my sides, even though I wasn’t exactly trying to attract his attention. I still didn’t want to detract his attention with my less than smoothly shaven armpits. At least I could confirm that he was officially not gay. 
	Hendrix dipped a clean towel into some cold water and started washing away the dried blood on my forearms. I shivered at the contact when the wet towel hit my skin and he paused to look up at me and ask silent permission. I nodded carefully. I wasn’t used to this kind of attention from a boy, not even Quarterback-Chris had been this… gentle. I wasn’t sure what to do with his attention, other than ignore it, since we would be parting ways in just a few hours. 
	He seemed to hesitate before nodding down at my jeans. “Uh, maybe we should cut those off too?” 
	“Yeah, that’s fine,” I agreed. “They were going in the trash anyway.” 
	“Do you have other clothes?” He asked hesitantly. 
	“Sure thing. From our shopping spree,” I smiled at him innocently.
	He ignored me. Again. “Alright, I’m going to cut around your thigh, and then I’ll deal with your knees. Do they feel as bad as your palms?” 
	“No, actually. I think my jeans protected them to some extent.” 
	Hendrix played with the knife in his hand for a minute before setting it down and slipping his fingers into the already ripped hole in my thigh. They were distressed jeans to begin with, but the recent wear and tear had turned simply frayed places into monster-sized holes. He wedged his fingers between my jeans and my thigh and I worked really hard at keeping my breathing even.
	There was the fact that a strange guy had his hands all over my upper thigh, but mostly I didn’t want him to rip away the jeans too quickly and cause my knees any unnecessary pain. I should have known better with him though, he was obviously not the kind of person that did anything irrationally or recklessly. 
	Carefully he tugged apart the material until it started ripping up towards my crotch. He coughed suddenly, a little surprised at the direction of the rip, before pulling his hands free and going for the knife again. Now that the rip was bigger, there was enough slack on the material so the knife could slash away without fear of my femoral artery being punctured. He repeated the process with my left leg until I was left with an unflattering pair of daisy dukes. 
	Oh, god. The hair. 
	I blushed the deepest red at the sight of my unshaven legs. How humiliating! 
	Hendrix lifted my leg and stretched it out atop his thighs. The unshaven disaster was even worse at this angle. I winced and dropped my head into my hands. 
	Guessing at what my mortification was about, Hendrix offered in an unconvincing voice, “It’s not that bad.” 
	“It’s really bad,” I whined, peeking out from behind my fingers. 
	A small smile tilted his lips while his eyes stayed intent on the few shards of glass that had embedded in my knees. 
	“It could be worse,” he shrugged. “It could be a mustache.”
	“Was that a joke?” I asked, a little surprised by his cavalier attitude. 
	He shrugged again. “So what?” 
	I giggled helplessly. “So, it was almost funny.” 
	His head shot up and I was treated with another scowl. I winked at him and relaxed back into a playful smile. He stared after me for a moment, clearly not knowing what to do with me. Soon enough he turned his attention back to my knees and started working out the shrapnel and then cleaning each cut carefully. When he was finished, and had spent time washing my calves since I clearly couldn’t with my useless and bandaged hands, he wrapped gauze all the way around both of my knees so the bandage wouldn’t slip off the still clotting cuts. 
	I slid my final leg off his as soon as the last bandage had been tied. He was up and out of his seat before my foot even landed back on the ground and across the room before I could get out of my chair. Geez, he was a weird one. 
	I hobbled, a little self-consciously, over to Haley and crawled up on the counter with her. My jeans had been cut short enough that I was worried about my ass hanging out of them while I stood. Sitting was a much safer option until I could change into the jeans Haley had grabbed earlier. I looked helplessly down at my hair-covered legs and winced all over again. 
	I mean, it was the end of the world, and personal hygiene had a checklist of priorities. In reality, clean-shaven legs were low on the list, especially since I’d had to discard my last razor two weeks ago. It had broken in half in my backpack, and the rusty blade was too dangerous to use. I’d been on the lookout for a new one, or even a sharp pocket knife- at this point I would have taken dull scissors- but so far hadn’t found one.
	Besides, up until this exact moment I had been working the unshaven legs- totally owning the look- hoping if we were ever kidnapped the au natural style would work in my favor as a deterrent. 
	I still felt like that, so I was a little confused by my self-consciousness right now just because Hendrix didn’t initially come off like a creeper. He still had four brothers that could easily not be as chivalrous. So why wasn’t I flashing around my prickly pear legs? And waving my arms in the air so everyone got a nice long look at my Eastern Europe styled pits? Good question. 
	“Have you been able to hear anything?” I asked Haley in a low voice. 
	She looked over at me and then did a double take when she took in the sight of my shorty shorts. “Nice legs, Mama,” she snorted at me. I loved her sense of humor, even when it was at my expense. I easily would have died of depression if it hadn’t been for her refusing to let me mope around aimlessly. Haley found laughter in every situation. She was one of those people that would forever be refreshing to be around. Back when we went to high school, she was easily the most popular girl in our class, only everyone loved her. Especially me. We had been besties since grade school and it was by sheer goodwill of the Universe that we still had each other after everything that had happened.
	“Shut it.” I stuck my tongue out at her and then waved my ridiculously bandaged hands. I couldn’t even wiggle my fingers, but I knew the care was necessary. 
	“Yeesh, it’s industrial strength,” she murmured while taking one of my palms into her hands. “But at least it looks like he knew what he was doing. He didn’t happen to have Neosporin, did he?”
	I nodded with excited eyes. “And rubbing alcohol.” 
	“Who are these guys?” Haley mumbled, lifting her eyes to the pow-wow happening in the corner. 
	“I don’t know, but apparently they don’t even want to rape us,” I whispered not bothering to hide my shock. 
	“What? Are they gay?” she gasped.
	“I asked. Turns out no. Apparently they’re brothers.” 
	“Huh.”
	“I know.”
	We watched them for a few more minutes while they seemed to argue between themselves. They kept their voices to a whisper, but their hands flew around animatedly. Hendrix seemed to have the most opinions and it seemed like he was most often arguing with the guy who had ordered him around before. Two of the guys with them were clearly younger, their facial hair more splotchy and their muscle definition not quite up to par with their brothers. They also didn’t have a whole lot to say, another indication they were low on the totem pole. 
	The final brother was just as tall and muscly as Hendrix, but it was hard to determine his age or how he fit into the chain of command. It seemed like he talked often enough to get his opinion across, but every once in a while he would lay a calming hand on Hendrix’s shoulder as if warning him to settle down. He followed the same dress code as all the others, only his hair was a light brown and his beard an even darker shade. Eventually he was the one to turn his attention back to us, his kind, apologetic eyes offering a certain soft-spoken hope.
	The other brothers followed his gaze and Hendrix let out an exasperated sigh. They made their way over, Hendrix trailing them all, and faced us. They were intimidating, that was for damn sure- even the younger ones in the back. They all stood with their legs apart, their arms crossed. Haley reached out and grabbed my bandaged hand, clasping it tightly in hers but careful not to disturb my wounds. We were ready for their judgment. 
	“When’s the last time you’ve had a good night’s sleep?” The leader asked in not an unpleasant tone.
	I bit my lip and glanced at Haley who looked as confused as I felt. Finally, I turned back to the brigade of boys and answered, “Define good night.”
	“When was the last time you slept the entire night through?” he clarified. 
	His question met silence. Neither Haley nor I could remember the last time we slept all the way through the night, and probably it hadn’t been since we were both back home living with our parents. 
	“That’s what I thought,” the guy nodded his head intuitively. “You can’t stay with us permanently. But you can spend the night,” he explained. “We will give you a full night’s rest before you move on in the morning.” 
	We were stunned silent. 
	Hendrix spoke up from the back of the group, “Explain the raping thing, Vaughan.”
	A slow smile broke out across Vaughan’s face and now I was made mute from how gorgeous he turned out to be. That wasn’t exactly fair. “Oh, and my little brother would like to assure you that you will not be raped.” He gestured out with his hands and said in a comforting voice, “This happens to be a rape-free zone.”
	“But what if we’ve changed our minds about that?” Haley whispered to me as she stared down at the floor.
	A nervous laugh burst out, but I found myself nodding excitedly. “We’ll take it.” I was smiling now, meeting Vaughan’s eyes. “We’ll leave first thing in the morning, but we will take your offer.”
	“Definitely,” Haley echoed. She hopped down from the counter and then helped me down since I couldn’t use my hands. Once we were settled on the ground she gestured between me and her in a friendly way. “Oh and I’m Haley and this is Reagan,” she announced to the dispersing room.
	Her introduction was met with a few half-hearted head nods. It seemed the brothers didn’t really care who we were and probably it didn’t matter. We would be leaving first thing in the morning, so why make pleasantries? It wasn’t like we’d become pen pals or anything. 
	“Nelson, get Page. She’ll be safe from these ones,” Vaughan ordered before turning back to us. He took three steps forward until we were face to face and his expression turned serious. “I’m Vaughan; you’ve met Hendrix and Nelson. My other two brothers are Harrison and King. Nelson went to get our sister, Page. Best you stay away from her.” He warned, his eyes flashing with a striking protectiveness. “If anything happens to my little sister, all responsible parties will suffer before they die excruciating deaths, got that?”
	“Sure thing, Boss,” Haley bravely patted his shoulder before walking off and asking either Harrison or King where we’d be staying tonight. 
	I looked up at Vaughan, whose eyes were a deep blue, almost navy. “Thank you,” I whispered. 
	“I don’t believe all of humanity is lost,” he whispered back somberly. 
	“Good for you,” I smirked and then walked off to find Haley. A thought struck me and I turned around and asked, “Stevie Ray?” 
	Vaughan’s face broke out in that breath-taking smile again and he nodded. “My dad was a guitar teacher. He named us all after the greats.”
	I laughed at that. Stevie Ray Vaughan was an iconic guitarist and Hendrix suddenly made sense as well. “Jimi?” I asked just to be sure.
	“Yep.”
	“Uh,” I thought about it for a minute before pointing at Nelson. “Willie?” I asked on a laugh. 
	Vaughan’s grin widened and then he nodded. “George Harrison,” he explained while pointing to the second to youngest brother.
	“Wait,” I held up my hand. I thought over the remaining names for a moment before I came to my conclusion. “BB?” I asked, referring to King. 
	A genuine look of surprise flashed across Vaughan’s face before he said, “Okay, now Page.”
	I thought about that for a minute longer while walking backwards towards Haley, “Jimmy Page. Led Zeppelin.” 
	“Very good,” Vaughan admitted. “I’m impressed.”
	“What? You guys think you’re the last of the eclectic musicians?” 
	Vaughan let out a bark of laughter and shook his head at me. “I guess not. Welcome to the Hotel California, Reagan.”

Chapter Three

	Haley and I got set up on our bed- a queen sized tempur pedic that we decide to share. We’d been sleeping back to back for almost two years now. It was how we protected ourselves, using our guns as pillows and taking turns sleeping. 
	I stretched out on the bed for a few minutes, the sheets were new- procured from the bedding section of this very floor- and the bed felt like pure heaven. I couldn’t even believe how long it had been since I’d slept in an actual bed. And when I truly processed how Haley and I had been living, how we’d just been barely surviving, I didn’t want to admit this was what my life boiled down to.
	I had three more weeks of high school when the initial infection broke out. I had three weeks left before I graduated. I had a partial academics scholarship to the University of Iowa and I was going to play intermural volleyball. I had this entire life planned out in my head, where I majored in elementary education, graduated in four and a half years after student teaching and then got a job in Des Moines. I would have this cute little apartment, the only roommate I had would be this rescue cat I picked up at the Humane Society and I would go out with my girlfriends on weekends. I would have eventually broken up with Quarterback-Chris, because if I was honest, that wasn’t the forever kind of love. 
	Obviously, since I popped his head off like a dandelion. 
	And then I would have met this really great guy one morning while I was getting coffee before school. We would have bumped into each other and he would have made a joke about it, then we would have fallen into easy conversation until I had to go before I was late for my teacher’s meeting. He would have gotten my number and the rest would have been this epic love story that ended in my dream wedding, four perfect kids and a house in the suburbs. 
	Ok, so maybe my ideal future had been a little less reality and a lot more chick flick. However, it was worth pointing out that I was not even living a straight-to-DVD version of that life. 
	Hobo-ing around the country, living off scavenged canned goods and cleaning up the Zombie infestation was more like the opposite of how I pictured my life going. 
	“Let’s dump out our brand new baubles and organize,” Haley suggested while pulling herself into a sitting position. “Besides, it wouldn’t hurt you to change. Your big ass is totally hanging out.”
	I squeaked and slapped my hands back there, trying to cover myself up. We were hidden behind the make shift curtain walls, but still, my ripped-up jeans were embarrassing with all these hot boys running around. 
	I pulled myself up so that I was sitting on my knees- my ass mostly hidden while I sat on it- and watched Haley dump out her backpack. Rolled up jeans and all kinds of t-shirts tumbled out, making a messy pile of treasure in front of me. I couldn’t hold back my smile- loot, glorious loot.
	Possibly, I was a pirate in a former life. 
	I dumped my bag, as well, with the makeup and the excessive amount of underwear I’d grabbed. Holding up a pair of bright pink boy shorts that had “Lickable” written across the ass, I waggled my eyes at Haley.
	“Those are horrible,” she groaned but took them from me anyway.
	“The joys of shopping in the junior department,” I smirked. 
	A throat cleared from behind us and Haley practically sprained her wrist trying to hide the provocative panties, shoving them underneath her thighs. She blushed bright red as we turned our attention to Nelson who was standing in our makeshift doorway, looking amused. I almost laughed out loud. Haley had never blushed, not even when we were in school. She owned her hotness and her sassiness; boys hardly ever stood a chance against her. And now Nelson, in all his sexy-stranger-glory, was giving my poor girl a run for her money with his lifted eyebrows and barely contained smirk.
	“I just wanted to tell you ladies that there’s a bathroom if you wanted to clean up. We don’t have running water, but you can do the whole sponge bath thing. And then there’s food if you’re hungry.” His dark hair was hanging over his forehead, his dark blue eyes sparkling with humor at Haley’s odd behavior. 
	Haley seemed unable to speak, so I answered for her, “Thanks, but the bed is enough. We don’t want to deplete any of your supplies. We’re really not here to take from you.” 
	Nelson cocked his head back like I’d surprised him, and then scratched his scruffy beard thoughtfully. “Reagan, we have an abundance of supplies and when these run out we’ll just move on and build it up elsewhere. We know how to survive and we know how to scrimp when we need to. We offered you a place to stay because we had one to give to you. Now we’re offering you a bath and food because we have that to give to you, too. If we didn’t, you wouldn’t be here.”
	I pressed my lips together trying to accept his explanation, both because he was being so generous and because I was afraid to analyze what it would have meant for us if they didn’t have space for us. This family seemed fiercely protective of each other and I truly believed they would eliminate any kind of threat to any part of their family.
	Including me and Hales. 
	Best not to become a threat. 
	“Alright,” I finally relented. “Thank you, for everything.” 
	“Sure,” Nelson smiled, but his eyes were on Haley, not me. Not that she would know since she was busy picking invisible lint of the bed spread. 
	Nelson disappeared and I nudged Haley with my knee. “So, bath?” I couldn’t help grinning from ear to ear. 
	“Uh, no thanks,” she shook her head. “I prefer the filthy, street urchin look. I think it brings out my eyes.” But then she was wearing her own grin and grabbing all kinds of new clothes and the Lickable undies. 
	I had some travel-size shampoo and conditioner we commandeered at the last safe settlement we’d stayed at. I traded three packs of Marlborough Reds for them. Haley and I were always on the lookout for things like that, cigarettes, bottles of alcohol, fingernail paint. People would pay dearly for their vices, or to just feel normal for a few moments. 
	This was kind of how I imagined the bartering system in prison to work.
	Turns out I would have been a very profitable inmate. 
	We got to work in the bathroom as soon as the swinging door shut behind us, and made the best use of our opportunity. Since I was still bandaged and broken, Haley washed my hair and I took care of the rest with the tips of my fingers that weren’t covered and a wet wash cloth. It was mostly a pansy effort as far as the deep scrubbing should have gone, but it was the best I could do with lacerated palms. 
	The water was room temperature and came from a multitude of plastic bottles, but it was better than ice cold and we knew it was clean. I would never complain since we looked human again. Our hair actually smelled good, our nails were clean, our skin not sticky, sweaty and stinky. We dressed in some yoga pants and tank tops that would be comfortable to sleep in, but utilitarian too, just in case we had to leave suddenly. And we even used the mirror to apply some of the makeup I grabbed. Not that we were trying to impress our hosts, but it felt good to have mascara on again. And Chapstick, oh, sweetness, my lips felt fantastic. 
	Back in our borrowed space, we found some more bandages and Neosporin lying on top of the bed. Haley helped change my dressings and we both breathed out a sigh of relief at how well my wounds seemed to be closing up. We both slipped on socks and lined up our shoes at the end of our bed. 
	It was weird to be without shoes. We never walked around barefoot anymore, there just wasn’t that option. The only time our shoes ever came off, was just so we could change clothes; but immediately they went back on. And we were never barefoot at the same time. We were always ready to run or fight. We had to be. This was the nature of the world we lived in. 
	We set some better traveling clothes out next to our freshly organized packs and tidied up the small space we shared. Even though this place felt safer than anywhere we’d been in years, we always had to be ready to run- always.
	Finally, we left our living space to raid the kitchen. My hair was down and floating around my shoulders; it tickled my skin and felt cool and refreshing since it was still damp. It was longer than it ever had been and I reminded myself to be on the lookout for some scissors so Haley could trim it for me sometime.
	“Oh, my gosh, Reagan, they have peanut butter,” Haley groaned. She lifted a jar of creamy Jiffy and started to unscrew the red cap. 
	“Wait, Haley,” I gasped before grabbing a plastic spoon and jumping to stand next to her. “Ok, go.” 
	She slowly twisted off the cap and we sat there staring at the untouched peanut butter for several moments, just inhaling the scent. I honestly wiped at my mouth because I was afraid I was drooling. 
	“Knock yourselves out, we all hate that stuff,” Vaughan offered.
	“What?” Haley snapped her head up to stare him down. “You all hate peanut butter? Are you sure you’re not Zombies?”
	Vaughan laughed. “Pretty sure.”
	“So you don’t mind if we….?” I gestured at the peanut butter and swirled my spoon over it. 
	“Like I said, knock yourselves out,” he smiled at me. “We just found it the last time we went raiding and thought why not? If worse comes to worst, right?” 
	Haley and I made sounds of agreement but were already spoon deep in the deliciousness and moaning over the taste on our tongues.
	“When’s the last time you girls had anything to eat?” Vaughan asked, clearly amused with our reaction to good food. 
	I looked over the top of my spoon at Haley, feeling the familiar instinct to be careful with what I revealed to others. “What’s it been, Hales? Three days?”
	“Four,” she corrected quickly. “And it was a tuna and cracker pack that we shared.” 
	I shuddered at the memory. Tuna was so gross, but we seemed to find it the most often. Plus, it did have protein, which we needed desperately. 
	“So you’ve just been constantly moving from place to place, scavenging where you can?” Vaughan asked slowly. His eyebrows were drawn together and his lips turned down in a frown.
	I suddenly felt protective of our lifestyle. No, it wasn’t ideal, but it was all we had. And we were surviving, which was the most important part. 
	“We’ve never had the resources to set up like you guys,” I spat out defensively. “And it’s not like we can just settle into someone else’s settlement. I’m not ready to repopulate the planet with some sixty year old guy that already has seven other wives.”
	Vaughan grimaced at my words. “You obviously see how dangerous it is out there for two pretty, unarmed girls.” 
	“I’m not unarmed,” I shot back.
	“Haley is,” he argued.
	“For now,” she said with a hint of threat in her voice. “Just for now.” 
	“We know how to take care of ourselves, Vaughan,” I said evenly to diffuse the growing tension between us. I didn’t see why he cared, though. He had given us one night here; he’d made it clear that was as far as his generosity went. It didn’t make sense that now he was trying to convince us to take better care of ourselves. Obviously, if there was a better way, we would be doing it by now. “We’ve made it on our own for almost two years. And while we appreciate your generosity, we don’t need you babysitting us.” 
	Vaughan held up his hands in defeat, but his eyes glimmered with a silent challenge. “I get it. I’m not judging you.” 
	Vaughan walked away, leaving us with our peanut butter. The smooth stickiness coated my mouth and tasted like heaven. I sucked on the spoon a little, making sure I got every last bite. I groaned at the taste of something so rich and delicious. These boys could rule the world with supplies like this.
	And that wasn’t far from the truth. 
	A tingle spread out across my neck and I had the distinct feeling I was being watched. My eyes snapped up and locked with Hendrix’s. He was across the room, standing in the middle of the floor just watching me. It was like our gaze had caught him mid-step and he wasn’t sure what to do next. 
	After years of being chased by Zombies, I wasn’t intimidated easily, but there was something so revealing about his stare I wasn’t sure what to do with myself. I pulled the spoon out of my mouth and licked my lips nervously while he just stood there, staring at me. 
	Haley gave me a nudge with her shoulder and my attention was successfully averted. I looked down at the peanut butter jar and felt my cheeks heat from a confusing blush. I wondered if Hendrix would have been this strange in a normal world, or if everything normal inside of him snapped when things got bad.
	Or maybe, in the pre-Zombie world, he was just as brooding and serious. If he were cast in my Zombie version of Vampire Diaries, he so would have been Stefan, the very brother I wanted to watch die of something grotesque and gruesome. Team Daemon every single day. 
	“What was that about?” Haley whispered. She opened a pack of Ritz crackers and we both dug in, spreading the peanut butter across the cracker before devouring them- this was a feast. 
	“I have no idea,” I giggled. 
	“You have pretty hair,” a small, unmistakably girly voice said from behind me. 
	Haley and I both turned to face Page. She had to Page- the fact that she was a little girl and the spitting image of her brothers mostly gave it away. She had long, dark blonde hair like Hendrix. It curled at the ends and stopped halfway down her petite back. She had huge, bright blue eyes that were widened with curiosity and full, Cupid’s bow lips that I believed were a family trait. She couldn’t have been more than nine and she reminded me of a fairy. Her features were gorgeously exaggerated and she had the cutest ears poking through her curtain of thick hair. 
	I looked from Haley back to Page, before deciding she was talking to me, since her attention was firmly fixed on my face. “Thank you,” I smiled easily. “So do you.”
	“Thank you,” she beamed back. “It’s nice to hear that. Did you know boys don’t know how to say thank you? My mama taught me, she taught me how to use all my manners. But Vaughan says most boys didn’t have the same kind of mama. And he says our mama forgot to teach my brothers.”
	Haley and I did our best to bite back laughter. “I bet your mama didn’t forget to teach them.” I leaned forward as if I was telling her a secret. “I bet they just forgot to learn.” 
	Page’s eyes lit up with excitement and she bobbed her head up and down in agreement. “I bet you’re right!” 
	“Do you want some peanut butter or crackers?” I asked, holding out the jar for her.
	She wrinkled her precious little upturned nose and shook her head again, her glossy hair bouncing around her shoulders. “No, thank you.”
	“Those are great manners,” I encouraged before trading my offering to the sleeve of crackers. She took a few from the package and started nibbling on them. 
	“Hey, Page,” Hendrix greeted slowly. He joined us in the kitchen area, leaning up against the wall. His eyes were narrowed in distrust and he glanced over his sister with careful concern. “Making some friends?”
	“Hendrix,” Page said seriously, “They have manners.”
	Haley choked on a giggle and I shot Hendrix a saucy wink. He didn’t seem to know what to do with me, which made me kind of giddy for some reason.
	“I think Page has given up on the male species as a whole,” I explained to Hendrix. “As it turns, out boys everywhere aren’t able to remember their manners.” 
	The peaks of Hendrix’s cheeks pinkened and he cast his eyes down at his shuffling feet. “We just tease her,” he admitted. 
	“And the male species is lost as a whole,” Haley grunted. And then in a whisper she said, “Probably best not to get her hopes up.”
	“Is that why you two are traveling alone?” Vaughan interrupted the conversation, followed by the rest of the brothers. Nelson looked truly interested, but King and Harrison mostly looked like they didn’t have anything else to do.
	“Who’s left to travel with?” Haley asked on an annoyed grunt. “Everyone we know is dead.”
	“Except us,” I reiterated obviously, just so we could hear it again. 
	“Except us,” Haley whispered. 
	“How did you girls survive? How have you survived this long?” Nelson asked, his eyebrows drawn and his gaze fixed on Haley again. 
	“We got kind of lucky,” Haley explained somberly. “Everything fell apart for us in three days. When Reagan’s boyfriend tried to eat her, we decided it was time to skip town and head south.” 
	“Where are you from?” Vaughan this time. 
	I allowed the questions, but only because I had as many for them. 
	“Iowa,” Haley said. 
	“What do you mean your boyfriend tried to eat you?” Hendrix asked insistently.
	I hesitated. Inside my head I joked up about it, but in reality it was pretty f-ed up. Not that everyone still alive and not eating human flesh didn’t have a similar story, but Chris had once been a person, had once been a friend and potential lover. 
	Ok, I shuddered at that. That just sounded…. wrong. Zombie or not.
	“In two days, we’d both lost our parents,” I gestured between Haley and myself. “We hadn’t really taken the Zombie threat seriously until then. I mean, honestly, who could have known Zombies turned out to be real; they were supposed to just be this thing in movies. Our parents got off easy. They were in a town assembly, with most of the other adults, trying to figure out what to make of the military and news reports and the assembly was attacked. Some were turned into Feeders, but a lot of them were just slaughtered. Our parents were the lucky ones.” We all knew that meant they died on the spot, that didn’t need to be said. “We thought about sticking around, making a haven of the place we’d lived our whole lives, but when Chris came over to stay with me….” I trailed off, not knowing how to finish that one. 
	“He tried to gobble her up. So she stabbed him in the face with a butcher knife and then practiced parallel parking on his body until his head wasn’t attached to his neck anymore,” Haley finished dramatically.
	I sighed- so not one of the shining moments of humanity. 
	“Impressive,” whistled Vaughan. 
	“Necessary,” I countered. 
	“Definitely,” Hendrix agreed.
	“And then you guys just booked it?” Nelson finished the story.
	“First we confirmed that neither of us had added brains to our daily food pyramid and then we packed up the still bloody Escalade and drove it till there wasn’t any gas left.”
	Haley added, “Which wasn’t very long. We’d only had a half tank to begin with and by the time we needed to fill up, the gas stations were war zones. We ditched the car and started walking.
	“Smart of you not to risk gas,” Vaughan noted. And he was right. By the time Haley and I fled our childhood homes, humanity had seemingly forgotten everything civilized and safe. Grocery stores, gas stations and Costco’s- especially Costco’s- all became battlegrounds for a deadly version of capture the flag. All the settlements we saw along the way were set up near a cluster of those things. Even though gas and food supplies were probably on the thin side now, those buildings still represented power and wealth. Even if settlements were relatively peaceful, it was guaranteed they hadn’t started out that way. 
	“What’s your ultimate plan?” Hendrix asked in a rumbling voice. I looked up at him and met his stare. He was intimidating and practical. I got the distinct impression when Hendrix asked questions they were always directed to get necessary, concise answers. 
	“We’re going south,” Haley said on a shrug. I shot her a glare but she either didn’t see me or was ignoring me. 
	“South where?” Hendrix asked, standing up a bit straighter. His shoulders were tense and rigid, his body strung tight with something aggressive. 
	I cleared my throat in a plea to get Haley to shut up, but she plowed forward, definitely ignoring me. “South America, Compadre. Or what used to be that general vicinity.” 
	“You can’t be serious,” Vaughan scoffed, sharing a look with his brother. Vaughan rubbed a hand across his scruffy jaw in a gesture of frustration. 
	“Dead,” Haley smiled sweetly. “Serious that is.”
	“Why in the hell would you want to go down there?” Nelson gaped at us. 
	“Language,” Page hissed in the sweetest, sternest voice I’d ever heard. Pretty sure I was already in love with that little girl. 
	“Sorry, Pagey,” Nelson smiled sheepishly down at his little sister who gave him a benevolent nod of approval in return. “Why in the world would you head south? You have to have heard about the drug cartel? The slaving? The armies of Zombies?”
	All eyes landed on me, as if this was my idea alone and I was dragging poor Haley along to her death. Which…. Ok, maybe that was true, but I had a good reason for going that way.
	“Sure, we’ve heard of those things,” I lifted my shoulders casually. 
	“And you’re still going there?” Hendrix asked incredulously. His eyes were flashing with anger, and he worked his jaw back and forth in frustration. “What’s down there that would make you willing to face Zombies in hordes, or worse, ex-cartel that would enslave you and make you entertain whole encampments of men?” 
	“It’s the mountains,” I whispered. I didn’t really want to give this away, but I had the deepest urge to defend my decision.
	“We have mountains here,” Hendrix said slowly. 
He seemed to have reined back the control he’d lost moments ago. It wasn’t until he regained his composure that I realized how out of place it felt when he’d started yelling at me. I shook my head a little at that though, wondering why I even thought I knew him enough to judge his character or personality. We literally met hours ago; I had no idea who this guy was.
“My dad’s cousin lives, or um, lived down there. As far as I know, she’s still alive. Anyway, she was this missionary. She had an orphanage in the Andes Mountains. When things started to get bad, she begged my dad to move us down there. She said it was safer than Iowa. She was protected by the mountains, there were very few people up there and she knew of this ancient Mayan city that had walls. She said we’d be able to protect ourselves, rebuild society.” My stomach churned with uncertainty, even as I pressed myself to sound confident. Mayan ruins? Andes Mountains? It really did sound crazy. 
“Yeah and when’s the last time you talked to her?” Hendrix pushed, that careful control slipping again. 
“Right before my parents died,” I answered. There wasn’t a way to make them understand, to get them to see my view on this. I knew that- mostly because it was practically insane to try to get through Mexico. Things had been dangerous down there for young girls traveling alone before the Zombie infestation. Now? It would be a miracle if I survived just crossing the border. “The phones were still working and my parents were considering it. They thought they would see how the assembly went, what other news was being floated around and then we would either stay or buy a plane ticket.”
“Your parents died early,” Page whispered with the wisdom of someone five times here age. “Ours didn’t go to heaven until after the planes stopped flying and the cars stopped driving.”
I pressed my lips together, uncomfortable with her sentiment. Iowa had been overtaken surprisingly fast, considering how many empty miles fell between all that farmland. It still seemed impossible that my entire home town was now a Zombie playground. 
Page was right though, my parents had gone early, because we’d been unprepared. Something I vowed never to be again, well until tonight when I karate kicked my way into these people’s lives- literally. These boys made me feel very unprepared for life. 
“You’ll never make it through Mexico,” Hendrix announced gravely, getting us back on topic.
“We’ve made it this far,” I argued.
“By pure luck and our generosity,” he countered.
I snorted at that, “Hardly. We would have made it out just fine. In case you didn’t notice, Haley swept up down there.”
“Yeah, fine,” he bit out. “But now her gun is empty. And how much ammo do you have left, Reagan? You hadn’t even drawn your weapon when you came flying through that door. I bet you have less than a handful of bullets left. I bet you’re on the last of everything.” 
“That’s not entirely true. I’ve got plenty of makeup.” I shot him a sassy look and turned an evil glare on Haley. 
“My point exactly,” Hendrix growled. 
“Ok, great plan-maker, what’s your long term goal? You can’t stay here forever. Eventually you too will run out of supplies, water, and food. Then, what?” I was furious by now. Hendrix had made me feel tiny and my plans seem stupid. It was obnoxious how quickly he could derail me and then fluster my every thought. 
“We’re heading north,” Vaughan replied evenly, not at all as angry as his brother. “Nova Scotia, or anywhere isolated in the Canadian provinces.”
“No slavers up north and not as many people turned Zombies to run into,” Nelson explained further. “We’re going through the Dakotas, taking our time so that we can stay strong, well-fed.” 
“Racing your way anywhere, so that you’re starving and unarmed is foolish,” Hendrix echoed, obviously digging directly at our methods of travel.
“Going the pace of a snail, so that all that glorious land you were gunning for, is occupied and settled, is just as foolish,” I growled back. 
“It’s not the California Gold Rush, Reagan. You’re playing with your lives when you expose yourself like this. You’re obviously starved and undersupplied. What would have happened to you if we wouldn’t have found you digging through the women’s clothing? Where would you have slept tonight?” Hendrix’s blue eyes were as deep as the ocean, his face flushed with emotion.
This both bristled and terrified me, “What do you care, Hendrix? We are not your concern. In fact, in T-six hours, we’re going to be well on our way, headed toward the other side of the equator than you. Leave it alone.” 
	I met his heated stare straight on and dared him to make some kind of contradiction, although I couldn’t even imagine what he would say. And apparently either could he, because he stayed silent, just the click of his jaw as he ground his teeth in frustration. 
	Vaughan cleared his through uncomfortably before saying, “Alright, now that we’ve gotten that settled, its’ time for bed, Page.” 
	She put up a pathetic attempt at getting out of it, but after a stern look from her older brother, she obeyed by heading off to brush her teeth. 
	Haley and I too, said goodnight to the brothers and walked over to our comfortable room. We laid down on the bed, side by side, our fingers interlocked and our thoughts spinning a mile a minute. 
	I didn’t know how to explain to Haley the need I had to go south, the instinct and faith in us; I had to keep us moving that direction. And I was guessing, after all the doubts Hendrix had just planted, that she was thinking about what a mistake she had made to follow my lead. Neither of us could voice our thoughts though and so we stayed quiet. 
	Besides, we’d made it through this day. And in our uncertain lives, each day we survived was enough to be thankful for. 
	Eventually, we both turned so that our backs were to each other and our hands on the guns under our pillows. Mine was loaded and ready; Haley’s had simply become a security blanket after it had run out of bullets. This wasn’t the first time we’d been low on ammo and it would by no means be the last. I was just thankful Nelson had returned it earlier, after they decided we weren’t threats. 
	Sleeping on the bed was the most comfortable experience I could remember. I’d finally drifted off in peaceful sublime when the first pounding of a fist sounded loudly through the empty room. 
	Like the hand of a demigod that boomed a rattling echo throughout the room; the fist came down again on the steel barrier that sat melded on those stairs. Another bang and I was sitting up in bed, watching the entire room of brothers, Page and Haley follow suit. I shared a terrified look with Haley as our nightmare became reality. 
	One fist was joined by two, and then two more. My heart got caught somewhere in my throat and I rubbed my sleepy eyes roughly. 
	Through the pounding of fists, the low, tell-tale moaning could be heard like an undercurrent of the Grim Reaper’s soundtrack. The putrid stench of death floated through the air, and I knew that my peaceful night of sleep was officially at an end. 
	The Feeders had followed us, right up to the top floor of utopia. 
	Looked like we would be checking out a few hours ahead of schedule.

Chapter Four

	“Time to move on?” Haley asked dryly. Her voice was rough with sleep, her blonde hair a rat’s nest of messy. 
	“Looks like it,” I agreed in an equally raspy voice. Up until this moment I was sleeping better than I had in a very, very long time. And, even though I was ripped from sleep by an impending Zombie infestation, I was at least waking up semi-rested and without a nasty crick in my neck. 
	So, this was much better than most nights.
	“Girls, we’re moving out in three minutes.” Hendrix stood in the doorway, semi-automatic machine gun held firmly in his hands. Where the hell did he get that? “Throw some shoes on. You don’t have time to pack.”
	I snorted. “Like, we’re not completely ready to go already.” 
	Haley and I jumped up from bed and slipped our shoes on while simultaneously throwing on long-sleeved t’s over our tank tops. I had my hair knotted on the top of my head and my backpack shouldered in thirty seconds. 
	“Ready,” Haley said with a smile. She twirled her empty gun on her index finger and I probably would have laughed if the solid steel over the stairwell hadn’t started shaking from the incessant pounding of hungry Zombies out for a midnight snack.
	Hendrix gave us a look of mixed surprise and respect and then nodded his head for us to follow him.
	“Do you have any more of those you want to share?” I asked, indicating the machine gun. 
	“Over by Vaughan,” he pointed to a table that had been covered by a curtain before. “Take your pick.” 
	The table was layered with guns and ammo of every size, shape and power. I walked over in a dazed stupor. Where did all this come from?
	At my look of amazement, Vaughan smirked, “We’ve been collecting.”
“More like hoarding,” I moaned excitedly. “I can pick?”
	“Take whatever you want, but make sure you know how to use it,” he instructed while strapping on his own guns and filling a second backpack in addition to the one he was already wearing. “We leave in one minute.”
	Haley and I shared a smile and then loaded up; two semi-automatic hand guns in each palm, several more thrown into the top of our packs with matching ammo and then… that was it.
	“Damn it, the sweats!” Haley groaned. With jeans we could have easily tucked a gun in the back of our waistband, but yoga pants didn’t have pockets and weren’t tight enough- comfy to sleep in, sucky to run from Zombies in. 
	“We’ll be okay,” I assured her evenly. “Move your water to your pack and tuck some more guns into the side straps of your backpack.”
	“Good idea,” she agreed. 
	We did that quickly while Nelson, King and Harrison strapped on their own assortments of guns. By this time the steel bent and groaned with the pressure of so many Feeders pushing against it. It was just a matter of moments before the barrier snapped like a crushed can of soda.
	My heart dropped a little bit when I saw how many guns would get left behind, but there wasn’t anything I could do about that or the food that wouldn’t make it either. This was survival. We would be fighting our way through who knew how many Zombies; there wasn’t time to mourn left-behind peanut butter. 
	Okay, maybe there were five seconds to whimper about it.
	“Let’s go,” Vaughan called out quietly from in front of the elevators. Despite his effort to keep his voice soft, the Zombie’s frantic pounding increased at the sound of life where they couldn’t see it.
	We stood in line while Nelson and Vaughan took crowbars to the seamed steelwork that kept the elevators locked up. Page stayed tucked in Harrison’s arms through the tense minutes it took to pry the doors apart; and all the while the metal cage above the stairs shifted and swayed. The hungry growls of Feeders only grew louder and more insistent. 
	“This leads to the outside?” I asked Hendrix who had come to stand next to me.
“Eventually,” he shrugged. He sounded casual, but he was bouncing on the balls of his feet, his hands fidgeting and eyes continually drifting to Page. He was a ball of energy, completely alert and ready to protect his family. 
	“Alright, well thanks then,” I whispered sincerely. Nelson and Vaughan finally got the doors open and pulled a thick wire cable from where the elevator sat idling. They began yanking on it together so that the elevator was raised past the floor and a crawl space was created by a makeshift pulley system. 
	Clever boys.
	“For what?” Hendrix asked with his attention fully on me now.
	“For everything,” I shrugged. 
“You sound like you’re expecting to die, Reagan,” Hendrix snapped a little louder than I felt comfortable with. The Zombies screeched in reply. “We have an escape plan. You’re going to be just fine.” 
	I repressed a laugh and admitted, “I know that. But we’re headed south and you’re headed north. I was just saying thank you before we got separated and I never got the chance to. I mean it, thank you.”
	Hendrix looked down at me dumbfounded, like I’d just said the most insane thing. Finally Nelson got the cable securely stabilized and started waving his brothers through. Vaughan went first; he lay down and slid underneath the elevator carriage and then waved a hand once he was suspended underneath. I was assuming there were cables or ropes of some kind underneath, although I couldn’t see them. Harrison helped Page through the hole, and then we heard Vaughan’s encouraging words to her as she shook with fear.
	“Alright, Reagan,” Hendrix said softly but firmly, directly in my ear. I shivered as his breath cascaded down my neck and his rumbly voice wrapped around all of my senses. “I get the independence thing, but you’re not going south until we get the hell out of here and to safety. You stay directly behind me, you got that.”
	I whipped my head around to face him, while Haley crawled into the hole next. “Sweet offer, but I can take care of myself.”
	“Never said you couldn’t,” Hendrix growled. “Stay behind me, got that?”
	“Whatever makes you feel like a man,” I sighed, annoyed that I had somehow agreed to his protection without actually agreeing.
	“And we’ll talk about going south later,” he promised.
	Before I could respond with anything to that kind of crazy talk it was my turn to crawl through the elevator hole. I slid my arms through first and felt for the rope I had to believe would be there. My backpack barely squeezed through with me. Once my hands were firmly holding the thick wire cable, I awkwardly pulled my feet through and straddled the rope. I held on as tightly as I could, but my hands wanted to slip and my feet struggled for footing. 
	A flashlight had been dropped in the shaft and even though it hardly gave off any light, it was like a beacon of hope that promised there was life at the end of this rope. My biceps burned from holding my body up and my feet were planted so firmly against the wall I had no idea how I was going to get down. 
	Suddenly hands slid through the hole and my ass was being gripped firmly in Hendrix’s arms. 
	“What the hell?” I gasped as he worked something around my waist. 
	“Just,” he grunted, snapped a carabineer in place and then breathed out a,” There.” 
	He had tied a rope under my bum, supporting my weight and taking the pressure off my arms and hands. I still had to hold most of my weight by myself, but it was easier to move down the wall. Hendrix slid through the hole next and did the same to himself on the rope next to mine.
	“Where are you supposed to stay?” He ground out as we worked our way down the wall, leaning back and painstakingly walking our way down the elevator shaft. 
	I shot him a nasty look, but he couldn’t see me because of all the darkness. “Hendrix, are you kidding me?”
	“By me, Reagan. Always, by me,” he answered, ignoring my sarcasm. 
	My stomach flipped over at his words and suddenly I felt very sick- whether it was from the sudden onslaught of nerves or foreboding I had no idea, but there it was. I shook it off, convincing myself we’d be separated by the time this night was over. 
	The sounds of Harrison and King strapping in above us filled up the oppressive silence after Hendrix and I both fell quiet. Beads of sweat broke out across my forehead and every single muscle in my body burned with the effort to get to the ground.
We eventually hit the smooth concrete floor and started to unstrap without hesitation. Nelson was the last one through the hole above and just as I walked through the pried open elevator doors on the first floor, I heard a slice of a knife through the air, the whip of a taut cable as the pressure was suddenly released and the slam of the elevator back into place, suspended three floors above me.
	“We rigged it so it’s not connected to anything, but there’s a barrier to keep it from falling down the shaft. It should hold in place for a while. We’re just trying to confuse them while we get out of here. But if they follow our scent, the elevator won’t hold them for long.” Hendrix explained. 
	“Do you think my bloody clothes will confuse them?” I whispered, meanwhile ice cold dread sloshed through my stomach when I realized that also might have been what drew them here in the first place.
	“Probably,” Hendrix agreed.
	“Hey, I’m sorry-“
	“Not now, Reagan,” he cut me off and raised his weapon. 
	This section of the first floor was tucked away from the main hubbub of Zombie traffic. I could hear the horde of Feeders above us pounding on steel, desperate to get to live flesh. They were mindless in their hunger, their cognitive thinking long gone and replaced by an addiction, a powerful need that would destroy the human race all together if we couldn’t figure out a way to permanently survive their constant attacks. 
	Vaughan and Haley waited for us along the wall, their backs up against it, their guns drawn and pointed readily. Page stayed tucked between them, shouldering her own light pack, but weapon-free. This floor was lit up by the moonlight flooding through broken windows and plowed through walls. There were a few decaying bodies lying throughout the area, their stench choking in its ferocity; the sound of buzzing flies, the only thing to break up the cacophony of Feeder sounds above.
	Finally, King, Harrison and Nelson were at ground level and ready to bolt. We waited for Vaughan’s command and then we set out. Hendrix led the way, with Haley and me directly behind him; Nelson and Page were next and then King and Harrison. Vaughan brought up the rear like an expert. I was shocked at the level of precision these boys operated with. They were like a fluid, well-trained military unit. And I expected the older ones to be comfortable with weapons, they would have grown used to them the same way Haley and I had. But Harrison and King were just as proficiently in control. 
	We stepped our way carefully through the debris and bodies on the floor, working toward a section of the wall that had been blown out by… something. It was hard to decipher, since the debris around it was blackened and charred but not obliterated. 
	Just as Hendrix stepped through the hole, his gun went off in his hand- on purpose; but it scared the living hell out of me. A strangled moan sounded and then the body of a wandering Feeder slumped to the ground. 
	We all let out a collective breath that lasted half a second. The sound of Hendrix’s gun rang through the night and upstairs the pounding stopped immediately. It was like I could feel the attention of the horde shift from that metal box to our position downstairs.
	The hairs on my neck prickled stiffly, just before all pandemonium broke loose. Hendrix looked back over his shoulder, sharing a look with someone behind me before his eyes met mine in steely determination. 
	“With me,” he mouthed and just as I gave him a nod of agreement he took of sprinting. 
	I heard Nelson scoop Page up and the boys behind us were pounding pavement as Hendrix sprinted the way out of there. 
	The sounds of crashing metal echoed through the night and Zombies started charging us from every direction. They flooded the small Missouri downtown like how waters invaded space after a dam broke. They were everywhere, in every direction, ravaging the space between us and them. 
	They were mindless, yes- easily killed if you got a good shot to the head and it helped that they were no longer freely thinking human beings. But they were excellent hunters, obsessed with only one thing- eating. Usually they wandered slowly, stumbling around. But if there was a strong enough scent to grab their attention, if they were starving or focused on a kill, they could be faster than any normal human being, more cunning than humanly possible. 
	That was the state they were in now. Our skirmish earlier must have triggered something, or they were learning to communicate with each other, because there were more Feeders in this area than I had ever seen in one place. There were tons of them, at least fifty and they sounded ravenous as they chased us down. 
	Hendrix seemed to know where he was going and I pushed my body to its very limits to keep up with him. My pack was heavy and awkward, it was not comfortable to run with guns in both hands and if I was honest, my pants were kind of slipping down. None of that mattered though. All I had to do was run for my life, get away from these Feeders and believe Hendrix had a plan.
	Oh, my god, let him have a plan.
	“Reagan, to your left!” Vaughan called out from behind me and without thinking or slowing I turned to the left and started shooting. On the third shot I hit the Feeder in the throat, adjusted my aim and fired off another shot that landed directly between his eyes before he crumbled to the ground. 
	I breathed a short sigh of relief before sucking it right back in. They were everywhere, seemingly coming from all directions. They were bloodied, their faces simultaneously slack and fierce. Their eyes were bright with hunger, and their hands clawed at the air in front of them, desperate to capture a meal. The stench of death and decay permeated the air, and my eyes watered against the ferocity of it. 
	Guns started firing in every direction then. We closed in on each other, while still somehow moving forward. Nelson moved in the middle, Page clutched against his chest, her screams echoing in the space that wasn’t filled with gunshots or the ravening sounds of Feeders.
	Finally we reached an abandoned mechanic’s garage, with the lift gate still in place. Hendrix lunged for the rope that connected at the bottom and would pull up the heavy door. 
	“Reagan, Haley, help them cover me,” Hendrix shouted while using brute strength to lift the gates. 
	Zombie after Zombie was felled as our unit shot proficiently. Haley and I had stopped missing our targets a while ago, and I could tell these guys were in the same place. It wasn’t that I was born with this natural talent or even harbored some kind of intuitive skill. This capability, to get a Feeder directly between the eyes in one shot, was born out of necessity to live and lack of easily disposable ammunition. I didn’t have time or resources to waste shots and I really didn’t have any desire to become one of them or die gruesomely at their hands. 
	All it would take was one bite for my brain to stop processing coherent thoughts and concepts and my mouth to start watering specifically for living flesh. Just one, bloody, skin-breaking bite. 
	And if I got lucky, then I would just suffer through one of them eating me completely. That wouldn’t be a fast death, or a welcome one. 
	Those thoughts were what fueled each pull of the trigger, each perfectly aimed shot. Those were the thoughts that kept me relentless, kept me focused. 	
	No matter how many guns we aimed at the crowd, it just seemed to keep growing. They were coming from everywhere. We weren’t stopping them, only holding them off, but I knew this couldn’t last. There were just not enough of us, and way too many of them! 
	“Hendrix, we have to get out of here now!” Vaughan shouted over his shoulder. 
	With a powerful grunt of force, I heard the garage door lift open all the way just as a gush of stifled air escape the cage the garage had created and washed over my back. 
	We kept shooting, even more fervently now that our means of escape was exposed. We were the closest to safety we had been yet, at the same time the most vulnerable to death. 
	With an almost superhumanly quick glance over my shoulder I saw a gunmetal gray Hummer just waiting to take us to safety. 
	“For real?” I whooshed out a breath of relief. 
	“Always have a backup plan, Reagan,” Hendrix breathed over my shoulder. His right arm was aimed high and he was back to shooting the semi-circle of Zombies that had closed in around us. With his free hand, he snaked his arm around my waist and pulled me back against his chest. I was too focused to be surprised or react, but I would definitely be analyzing that move to death if I survived this. 
	As one we started backing toward the car, until Vaughan called out the order to go. 
	We all dove for the Hummer, Hendrix never let up his grip on my waist until I was sufficiently shoved into third row back seat. Haley scrambled up after me. Page was tossed in on the other side and then Nelson, King and Harrison crawled into the second row seating. Vaughan and Hendrix were the last to jump in the front seat, with Vaughan driving. He started the vehicle immediately, keys already in the ignition. 
	All the windows were rolled down, which seemed unsafe to me at first and I expected them to get rolled up before we took off. Instead, every brother but Vaughan, who was driving, aimed their guns out the window and began shooting while Vaughan plowed ahead through the tightening ranks of Feeders. 
	Haley and I threw our bodies over Page, maneuvering her in between us and then covered our ears as gun shot after gun shot rang out loudly in the night. The poor child quaked with fear, screaming at the top of her lungs, but the sound was drowned out by the heavy gun fire. 
	The Zombies came without pause, and the guys shot back just as fiercely. The only break in their incessant shooting was when they needed to grab a different gun or quickly and expertly reload the one they were using. 
	Vaughan’s window was a glaring weak spot, since he couldn’t shoot and drive at the same time and that was where the Zombies seemed to focus. Nelson did his best as he leaned out the window and King climbed up through the sunroof and stood on the seat so he could pick them off from his bird’s eye view. 
	Vaughan plunged forward, through the crowd that would happily eat us, knocking bodies over right and left without managing to kill them. I glanced through the back window only to watch them rise again, sometimes dragging barely hanging body parts with them- such was their need to feed, the addiction to warm flesh so desperate they could no longer feel their own pain until they felt the kill shot to the brain. 
	They were swarming us now, rocking the car as Vaughan stomped on the gas, but got nowhere. A clawed, curled finger swiped through Harrison’s window, clawing at the seat where it missed Harrison, only to have him hit it a second later with a bullet through the eye. Blood splattered all over the outside of the car, and on the inside of the door; smelly, decaying bits of flesh sticking everywhere it landed. 
	My stomach rolled, but I kept it together. I had to. There was no losing it, not this close to safety. 
	Finally, fed up with our slow progress, Hendrix let out a loud growl of frustration and swung his body out the passenger window. Holding on to the roof with his inside arm, he aimed his semi-automatic machine gun and let loose on everything in front of us. Zombies en masse were felled by the spray of his gun, eventually clearing a path for Vaughan and the gigantic Hummer.
	Vaughan stomped down on the accelerator and we were thrown back against our seats as the car finally made forward progression. Hendrix cursed as the momentum swung him precariously from his window ledge perch and his gun shot off in the air. 
	Once he regained his balance, he swiftly traded his multiple-fire weapon for a simpler handgun and picked off the stragglers as they held on with scary strong hands. One by one, they were released from our vehicle and this life, and we were left to breathe through the remaining adrenaline and now palpable silence. 
	This strip of road was clear, and hopefully stayed clear for a while, although I knew that was too much to ask. Eventually there would be debris; eventually the Hummer would run out of gas. But right now, we had transportation and all of our limbs. No one was lost tonight- well no one that could still be considered of-the-living. And Haley and I had held on to our packs. 
	Vaughan rolled up the windows when everyone, and every gun, was safely tucked back inside and we sat in silence for twenty more minutes before anyone made a sound. Haley and I kept our arms wrapped around a still trembling Page, and each other.
	Tonight had been a close freaking call.
	We’d had them before, but suddenly with Hendrix, Vaughan and all their siblings, the stakes seemed incredibly higher- there were way more people that could die. 
	When my heart started to beat a normal rhythm again and the Zombies were miles behind us, I found my strength and spoke up. “You can drop us anywhere, Vaughan. The sun should be up soon and we don’t want to get too far off course.”
	“Reagan,” Haley whispered and nodded her head in the direction of the just rising sun- to our left. 
	“Oh, that’s probably not necessary,” Vaughan coughed out, keeping his eyes firmly on the road in front of us. 
	“Turns out you sold us on the south, Reagan,” Hendrix explained evenly. He turned in his seat so he could look me in the eye. “Remember what we agreed earlier?”
	My heart slammed into my chest, coming to a complete stop before starting up again at an insane pace. He couldn’t possibly mean that he wanted me to stay with him- always. I shook my head to indicate I didn’t remember what he was talking about. 
	We just met. 
	There wasn’t anything between us to where he would risk his life for me. He had a family to think about, a little sister who was curled into my side so tightly it was painful- not that I would ever push her way. But for all I knew, I was leading them on a suicide mission. And the reluctant hope that started to flare in my chest when I thought this man- this incredibly loyal, capable man- wanting me was way more emotion than I was ready to deal with. 
	“You don’t remember?” Hendrix asked with narrowed eyes. “Then we’ll talk about it later. I’ll help you remember.” His voice was smooth sex appeal as it washed over my body and I shivered involuntarily. 
	My breathing became shallow and I felt the distant pang of butterflies attack my stomach. Hendrix turned back around in his seat, his shoulders back, his posture commanding and dominant even while he sat down. 
	Haley grabbed my knee and squeezed tightly at the same time she dropped her head to hide a smile. Looking up at me from under her still messy hair, she shot me a mischievous wink. It was overdramatic enough that I finally cracked a smile and let out a whoosh of air. 
	That was until I glanced back up and caught Vaughan’s angry stare in the review mirror. There was just enough light from the rising sun that I could see his attention was firmly fixed on me, his emotions roiling behind his dark blue eyes.
	His expression made me rethink every bit of relief I’d just felt. With a more confident voice than I felt, I argued, “Really, you don’t have to change your entire life plans for us. Haley and I can make it. And you have Page to think about.” 
	Vaughan and Hendrix both shot forward in their seats, ready to argue with me, but it was Nelson’s calm voice of reason that brought the final decision to a head. “Reagan, we’d already decided to stick with you girls before the Zombie’s attacked tonight. We’re safer with numbers, especially knowing that you ladies can actually use those guns you cradle around. There are not that many decent living beings left on this planet, probably best we stick together when we find each other.”
	“And you’re not going to try to convince us to go north?” I asked carefully, ready for the other shoe to drop.
	“Not yet,” Hendrix replied. “We didn’t know anybody up there with a firsthand account; we were just reaching at straws. With that phone call you had with your dad’s cousin, you have more than we ever had.”
	“Alright,” I breathed out slowly.
	“Alright,” Vaughan echoed.
	“Alright,” Haley snickered, still amused with Hendrix apparently. 
	“At least it will be exciting,” Harrison spoke for the first time since I’d met him. 
	We all let out a charged laugh. The atmosphere in the Hummer relaxed a little, even while all our eyes stayed sharply focused on the horizon and every other direction. The morning sun was rising in the east and we had at least a few more miles of clear road ahead of us. We survived the night, made new friends and our weapon’s store- although admittedly depleted after our Battle Royall- was greatly improved since the night before. 
We survived another night.
And with any luck we would survive another one. 
Harrison was right, this would be exciting.
Among a whole hell of a lot of other things in this world of decay.
I looked down at Page who had released her tight grip on me and finally fallen asleep. Then over at my best friend in the whole world who had miraculously survived with me this far. 
Okay, things would be exciting in this world of love and decay.

Chapter One
653 Days after initial infection

	“It’s the hard knock life for us,” King started out slowly, drudgingly- like a funeral march. 
	Harrison joined in and hit the high notes in a screeching falsetto, “It’s the hard knock life for us!”
	“Steada treated,” Nelson continued, “We got tricked.”
	“Steada kisses,” now all together in unison, “We got kicked.”
	“It’s the hard knock life,” King took it back out on a solo.
	“Oh, my god,” Haley grumbled. “I’m in a Zombie musical.”
	I snickered from the back seat. “How do you guys even know that song?” I asked, wondering where their knowledge of show tunes could have possibly come from. “What’s next? The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow?”
	“Is that a Jay-Z song?” Harrison asked in all honesty.
	Haley and I shared a look and then she smacked him on the back of the head. “You’re young, so I will forgive you for that.”
	“For what?” he asked in his squeaky, barely-pubescent voice. 
	“For thinking Jay-Z didn’t rip that song off a classic movie about little Orphan Annie and Sandy, the loyal but filthy dog that stole all of our hearts,” Haley lectured with a stern voice full of conviction. 
	“I didn’t understand any of that,” King admitted, shaking his head slowly back and forth.
	“Neither did I,” Nelson laughed.
	Haley spun around in her seat to send him the evil eye but he only grinned in response. He slid forward and jabbed her in the back with his long legs and she jerked forward. Her eyebrows shot up in surprise before she recovered and did the whole “I’m watching you” two-fingered point back and forth between them.
	“Haley?” Page interrupted their adorableness, tugging on her shirt sleeve. “Will you tell me about Jazzy and the orphan dog?” 
	“Nope,” Haley looked down at Page, who sat in between her and Harrison in the middle seat. Page’s face fell, but she tried to hide it as best she could. Haley smiled at her lovingly and relented, “But I will tell you about the Orphan Annie and her dog Sandy.”
	Page bounced in her seat, excited all over again. “And J-“
	“No, I will not tell you about Jay-Z, ever. And thanks to the Apocalypse you might never, ever have to hear about that entire genre of music for your entire life.” Haley shook her head. “But you may ask me about any of the following, Coldplay, Kings of Leon, Mumford and Sons and Simon and Garfunkel.”
	“Simon and Garfunkel?” Vaughan and Nelson spit out in unison. 
	“I’m eclectic,” Haley shrugged. 
	Nelson snorted. “You’re a music snob. There’s nothing wrong with Jay-Z. He owned an empire before the infection.” 
	“Ha!” Haley laughed. “Going by your pre-Apocalypse standards, the same could be said for P. Diddy.” 
	Nelson opened his mouth to vehemently argue that point but Hendrix beat him to it, “Diddy.” 
	Haley turned her angered attention on him, “Excuse me?”
	“Uh, Diddy. He just goes by Diddy now. Or then. Or…. before.” 
	“Haley, tell me about Orphan Annie! I want to know about Orphan Annie!” Page’s eyes were big with exasperation and I could easily sympathize with her.
	“Alright,” Haley gave in. “Once upon a time, there was a little girl who didn’t have any parents.”
	“Did they get eaten by Zombies?” Page interrupted. 
	That gave us all pause and everyone in the Hummer looked back and forth, avoiding the innocently curious eyes of our baby girl- I said our, because in the week we’d spent making excruciatingly slow progress through Missouri, Haley and I had fallen irrevocably in love with this little girl and claimed equal siblinghood with her.
	Hendrix cut in, adding to the story and surprising us all, or at least me. “No, Pagey, this was before all the Zombies. Her mommy and daddy didn’t even know what a Feeder was.”
	“Oh, they were so lucky!” she grinned at Haley, taking Hendrix at his word.
	“They sure were, Sweetness,” Haley said through a watery smile. “Okay, now no more interrupting my story, alright? Save all your questions till the end.”
	Page nodded and off Haley went with tales of Miss Hannigan and Daddy Warbucks. I yawned, feeling lulled by the melodic tone of Haley’s voice. I glanced over at King who sat in between Nelson and me in the back row; he had started to doze too. The good thing about driving during the day was that it was okay to fall asleep. We’d been making progress heading south, but it was very slow travel.	
	We all agreed that traveling during the day was safest. Nobody wanted to face the darkness with only headlights to illuminate the way. And even though Feeders weren’t bothered by the daylight, they seemed to prefer the night. Or, at least it seemed that way, but it might have been the brightness of the light that attracted them. We lived in this world without electricity, the streetlights were shut off, no houses or buildings created anything to break up the blackness, so when a car was barreling through the night with its headlights on bright, it was basically a “We Make a Delicious Snack” infomercial.
	So we spent our days driving as far as we could before the early afternoon, at which we would stop, preferably in a town, where we could at least pretend to look for supplies, even though most stores and resources had already been picked through. Once we’d find a good, easily protectable place, we would spend the remaining daylight hours turning it into a safe haven, aka a Zombie-free zone. 
	Vaughan, Hendrix and their brothers were very good at securing a location somewhere easily defendable and protected from Feeders. It was almost scary how mobilized and precise they were. Like they had been prepared for this- groomed for it. The GI Joes of the end of the world.
	Nelson slid forward and jammed his knees into the back of Haley’s seat again. She was jostled forward and let loose a curse under her breath. When she shot Nelson a dirty look without pausing her story, his grin grew bigger, more devilish. 
	I watched the entire exchange in a kind of horrified surprise. There were a million reasons this was a bad idea, but I was shocked Nelson hadn’t come up with them by himself. 
	I glared at him until he gave me his attention and then I mouthed, “Stop flirting!” 
	The planes of Nelson’s face heated red, but he tried to shrug it off. “What?” he mouthed back.
	“Stop flirting!” I demanded again, narrowing my eyes on him. We were like really angry mimes. 
	“You first,” he accused silently and then jabbed a finger toward the front seat. 
	My eyes flickered forward and met Hendrix’s immediately. He was turned around, talking quietly with Harrison, but his eyes were on me. My heart jump-started and slammed into my chest as his dark blue eyes held mine. He didn’t smile, didn’t move, and didn’t turn away. He just captured my gaze and paralyzed me. 
	“I don’t think we’re flirting,” I mumbled, tearing my eyes away from Hendrix and forcing them to my hands on my lap. 
	“Oh, I didn’t mean with him,” Nelson mumbled sounding smug. “He wouldn’t know how to flirt with a hooker.”
	I shot Nelson a nasty look and felt my face flush with embarrassment. He was talking about Vaughan, which made my assumption that it was Hendrix really bad. 
	After five days on the road with these guys, I didn’t really know what to think about them, or how to think about them. But I did know there couldn’t have been more of a difference between Vaughan and Hendrix. Even though they were only a year apart, they were night and day when it came to personalities. Vaughan was fun and hilarious; he always found a way to lighten the mood while still keeping control of every situation.
	Hendrix... Hendrix was the exact opposite. He kind of sucked the fun right out of the room and had a way of making every one of my emotions feel serious and dramatic. 
	Vaughan definitely flirted with me, but I wondered if that was only because I was the lone girl around to play with. He was equally attentive to Haley, but somehow Nelson, third brother down the line and only fifteen months younger than Hendrix, already claimed her- which made me really nervous. 
Didn’t Haley get a say in which brother she wanted, if she even wanted a brother? We weren’t here to hook up with these guys. We were trying to survive.
This was not an episode of Bachelor Zombie Island. This was our lives, and I wasn’t even convinced the Parker brothers were going to stick with us all the way to our destination. They had Page to think about, and Harrison and King were barely out of middle school. It wasn’t like they could gamble with their safety- which was made obvious by how slow our journey was taking. 
According to my road map of the US and Mexico I’d salvaged from the Escalade before Haley and I abandoned it back in Iowa, we were still in Missouri for goodness sakes. This was like the never ending-road trip, literally from hell. And even though gunfire had been minimal while we’d been able to keep everyone safe so far, nerves were high and tension was tight. 
There were just too many people for us to statistically make it all the way to Peru. I’d seen plenty of horror/end-of-the-world movies to know that we were in deep shit. Luckily Hales and I still had our v-cards. That would boost our staying-alive credibility by at least three extra lives. 
Yep, I’d just combined video games with movies and somehow converted it into my survival guide. Somehow this made logical sense to me. I was just going to go with it. 
Vaughan slamming on the brakes yanked me out of my thoughts and my arm swung protectively in front of King. He shot me a WTF look and I shrugged my shoulder, dropping my arm into my lap. 
“Sorry, uh, I don’t know where that came from.” 
The fifteen year old in the prime of puberty rolled his eyes at me and then snorted, “Thanks, Mom. I feel so super safe now.”
“Smartass,” I mumbled. “God, the end of the world has made you so cynical.”
We shared a smirk, all my misplaced maternal instincts hopefully forgotten, and turned our attention to the road block in front of us. Then the smirks quickly disappeared when Jaba the Zombie stood before us, grunting and drooling like a giant-sized slobbery dog. He was a massive individual; at least eight feet tall, giant club-like hands and razor sharp teeth that dripped with previously consumed brains. Okay, maybe I was exaggerating a tiny bit, but not by much. There weren’t actually brains stuck in his teeth- that I could see from here.
The scariest part of all was his bright red eyes that seemed to pulse with his manic hunger. I hated the red eyes. They seemed like overkill in the We’re Here to Give You Nightmares Department. 
Page started trembling in the seat in front of us and Haley pulled her into her arms. 
“Why’d you stop, Vaughan?” Nelson called from our row. “Just drive around him and let’s leave fat ass in our dusty wake.” 
Dusty wake? Sometimes Nelson seemed like a genius with how he talked. Not that dusty wake was anything profound, but there were times he spoke like a college professor. And then there were times when he thought tormenting Haley with his knees in her back was enough to woo her.
	Dear grown men everywhere, your elementary school bully tactics pissed us off back then, why are you still convinced they will ever work? Piece of advice, while you were pulling our hair and tripping us, we were giving our first kisses away to the boys that brought us flowers and candy. 
	Take lessons from the smart, non-violent men, those strategies still work.
	“Because,” Vaughan sighed sounding extremely tired. “He has backup.”
	Nelson and I saw the other gathered Feeders at the same time and let out twin gasps of shock and fear.
	We were on a stretch of highway that was mostly clear. A few times in the last couple days, the boys would have to get out and physically remove cars from the road while Haley and I provided backup from the roof of the Hummer. Page stayed tucked away inside with either Harrison or King keeping her company. This particular patch of pavement had already been cleared, abandoned cars shoved and hauled to the side of the road by some other travelers at some other time.
	The end result however, had created a line of cars, trucks, one city bus and a few sporadic motorcycles along the highway in what made a kind of wall on both sides of us. While the Oprah-special-of-a-Zombie created a roadblock down the center, his Death and Decay Gang stood on the roofs of the vehicles, eyeing us just as hungrily but also seeming to wait for a command. 
	“What the fu-” Nelson murmured but caught himself with a cough. 
	“Cuss jar,” Page whispered in a quaking voice. 
	The rest of us just kept staring at the problem beyond the hood of the Hummer. 
	“Do you think they want us to pay a toll?” Harrison asked dryly.
	I let out a bubble of nervous laughter. “Obviously, that’s why they’re blocking the road. Let me see if I have some spare change.” 
	“Reagan, get the duffle,” Vaughan instructed. 
	Reluctantly, I tore my eyes away from the threat in front of me and bent over my seat so I could dig around in the trunk. I moved as quickly as I could, hating that my back was facing an entire line of Feeders. Keeping them in sight at all times was a hard learned lesson that I was not about to forget anytime soon. But weapons were important at the moment and so I gave them priority. 
	I heaved the heavy bag over the seat with some help from King and Nelson and we immediately started passing guns and ammo forward. The soothing sound of magazines clicking into place filled the silence of the interior as the scent of decomposing, rancid flesh began to fill the cab.
	King shuddered next to me, “They smell extra hungry.”
	“That they do,” Hendrix agreed. Then he turned to face us, his eyes read Lecture Time and his serious mouth said, “I am not one with which you f.” “Vaughan and I will take lead. Nelson, Harrison you’re behind us. King stay in the van with Page.” His eyes flicked to mine and I lost the ability to breathe. They’d somehow softened at the same time they deepened in color. He was so protective of me for some reason, so possessive and it didn’t make sense to me at all. “Reagan and Haley, I want you to climb through the sunroof and use the vantage like a sniper. We’re going to move as fast as we can forward, but we’re not going to be able to hit everyone. You pick up the stragglers. How’s your range?” 
	“Fine,” I said quickly, even though I didn’t really know. It hadn’t mattered before if I could hit at long distances. If I missed, I always got a second chance because the Feeders never stopped coming after me or Haley, who was always right beside me. But if I missed this time, they wouldn’t need to come after me. They could swarm any of the guys instead. I shivered with the queasy feeling of how much responsibility now rested on my shoulders.
	“We’re great at long distance,” Haley assured Hendrix, but she wasn’t very convincing. 
	Hendrix’s eyes crinkled in the corners and he shot Haley a look. “I need you to do this,” he ordered, his eyes finding me again. 
	“I just don’t…” I cleared my throat, “I just don’t accidentally want to shoot one of you.” 
	“You won’t,” Hendrix promised. “You’ll be able to tell us apart. It will be easy.” 
	“Yeah, we’ll be the ones not trying to eat each other. And they will be the ones trying to make sandwiches out of us,” Vaughan bit out. 
	Harrison groaned. “Sandwiches. I haven’t had a sandwich in forever.”
	I shook my head at his casual attitude and then went back to digging in the giant black duffle bag for the right kind of long distance weapon. I pulled out two automatic rifles and passed them both to Haley, before pulling out two more. 
	We hadn’t taken much from the original safe house, but the Hummer was already packed and loaded, ready to go. I needed to find the opportunity to ask them where all the guns and ammo came from. It was on the top of my list. Right after, how did you get so good at this stuff? Are you part of a secret government program that knew the Zombies were coming and started raising children in order to fight them off- kind of like 21 Jump Street? Only instead of drug dealers in high schools, they prepared you for the Zombie Apocalypse? Also, how do I get Hendrix to stop looking at me like that…? 
	So, just looking for the right time…
	“Reagan,” Hendrix said my name in his deep voice and instantly had my attention- it was obnoxious how he could do that. “Do not start shooting till we take the big one down, alright?”
	“And if they attack you all at once?” I whispered, hating that Page had to hear all these details.
	“Then pick them off, outside to inside,” he instructed. “And if you don’t trust yourself, aim to wound, aim to slow them down, instead of going for a headshot that could miss and hit one of us instead.”
	I nodded and saw Haley agree out of the corner of my eye. Vaughan clicked his last magazine into place and let out a slow breath that we all echoed. He punched the sunroof button and its whirring sound filled the silence for a few seconds. Once the fresh, rotting, gag-worthy smell filled the car we all put our game faces on and flicked off our respective safeties. 
	“I should take out the big guy before you guys get out of the car,” I offered, realizing how ridiculous it would be for us to wait for their apparent leader to fall. 
	These Feeders seemed so organized, so patient. So far this was unheard of: A structured attack… Zombies waiting for us to make the first move. This could not be right. We were watching an active evolution happen in front of us. I’d much prefer them to de-evolve into puddles of slime or Jell-O or something. 
	Instead, here we were, watching Feeders unite themselves into military-esque units. They were playing defense, forcing us to make the first move. Also, apparently all that cheerleading finally paid off- basketball taught me something useful. Go team. 
My game plan seemed simple and effective: pick off the leader, let the rest fall into the chaos they belonged in, take out the rest with precise, practiced shots- that sounded logical to me. 
	“Not a chance. Sorry, Reagan, we’ll deal with him. You get the stragglers,” Vaughan commanded from the front seat. 
	Well, that just didn’t sit right with me. Once upon a time, in suburbia Middle America, I might have let the boys take care of the dirty work and kept my hands clean and perfectly manicured. But this feminist enlightenment had been forged in the Zombie fires and fine-tuned in good old bitterness and depression.
	You couldn’t teach someone this level of angry, they learned it the hard way- experience and two-full years of disappointment.
	Starting with freaking Quarterback Chris.
	“What’s our deal, Reagan?” Hendrix echoed his brother’s order. 
	I glared at him, unable to stop myself. He wanted me to stay behind him, as in after him, as in let him do my job while I cowered in the corner. Not going to happen. 
	“Then you better hurry,” I warned and then pulled myself up through the sunroof in a fast, fluid move I was pretty proud of. I didn’t even get tangled in my guns- because that had definitely happened before. 
	I heard the curses from the boys below, but I was too focused to be bothered by their outrage. Haley scrambled up to join me, and Vaughan and Hendrix were already through their doors.
	I let out a steady breath at the same time the Feeders seemed to move as one aggressive component to attack. As soon as my warm, living flesh appeared on top of the huge car, their slavering reached an uncontrollable point of no return.
	Sorry big guy, it looks like some of them do all that non-thinking all by themselves.
	I raised my rifle, cradling it against my shoulder and aimed at the beast-man barreling down on us. A few times in the past week, Hendrix and Vaughan had worked with Haley and me on how to shoot this particular weapon. We were plenty adept with the smaller ones, but something as large and powerful as an automatic rifle was an entirely different instrument. And while I had yet to shoot one, the entire process had been explained enough to me that I hoped I got the concept- because this former Prom Queen Runner Up was going to kick some serious Zombie ass. 
	I closed one eye and narrowed the other so I could see clearly through the sight. I exhaled a quivering breath and then forced my shaking hands to steady. Vaughan and Hendrix had been immediately engaged as soon as they set foot on the pavement and Harrison and Nelson were still trying to scramble out of the car. 
	Once I had the big guy’s forehead in focus, I squeezed the trigger and prepared for the kickback. I met the impact just like I was supposed to, lifted my gaze, and saw that I’d only taken a chunk out of his head- that filthy SOB. He was still on the way, and moving faster than anyone his size should be capable of moving. So I repeated my actions- bullet to the face. 
	It took two more gory, well-placed hits before I got my kill shot. He fell to the knees first and then swayed forward onto what was left of his face, just like in the movies, but without the slow motion. I wanted to celebrate, but there were plenty more where he came from and a hurkie off the top of the Hummer seemed a little excessive. 
	By now, Haley stood next to me on the roof and together we were picking off the outside circle of stragglers. There were about twenty five all together, each in a different state of decay, but all with red eyes and rotten teeth. Their grunts and growls filled the air, along with the disgusting smell. 
	Bam. Bam. Bam. I fired shot after shot- sometimes missing, sometimes hitting. When my first rifle emptied, I swung the second one I’d strapped around my shoulder and began firing that. Haley did the same thing.
	Hendrix and his brothers held their ground in front of the Hummer for as long as they could, and then started making a path forward, trying to end this before one of us became a casualty or we drew more attention from other nearby Feeders. 
	Sometimes I felt bad for them, especially after I killed one- I called it the Post-Slay-Guilt. They used to be human; they used to be neighbors, brothers, sisters, parents, and children. Now they were just these savaged, mindless killers and it made me really sad. But then they would do something super grotesque, like pause in the middle of all this gunfire and drop down to eat one of their own dead. And after that all my guilt and shame would magically disappear and I would take the opportunity of their distraction and pop them right between the eyes- boom goes the dynamite.  
	I kept my victims to the farthest edges of where the Parker brothers were making progress, but eventually that wasn’t possible anymore. There were still more Feeders than us, but they’d closed their ranks just like Vaughan had closed his. 
	“I’m out,” I said evenly to Haley. 
	She shot three more times, taking down one more Feeder on her side and nodded. “Me too.”
	“Should we let them clean up this mess all by themselves?” I asked, even while I pulled out the two hand guns I kept with me at all times. 
	“We could,” she shrugged. “But why let them have all the fun?” 
	“My thoughts exactly,” I smiled quickly and then put my game face on. 
	The two of us hopped from the roof to the hood and then to the ground in stealthy movements like we’d been plucked from the set of an action movie and ran forward with guns ready. Our scent caught the attention of more than a few Feeders and as soon as they turned to face us, we started shooting. 
	Out of my peripheral I saw Hendrix glance back at us and in that moment he let out a battle cry of fury. Returning to his fight, he started taking them out faster than I had ever seen anything happen. He cleaned up what was left of the battle in less than a minute. His body moved lithely through the crowd, quick and agile. He never missed, never took a bad shot; each pull of the trigger met successful results and by the time he finished, the rest of us were left wondering what the hell just happened. 
	Vaughan recovered first, ignoring his brother’s superhero like transformation. “Get back in the car before anymore show up. We’ll just, uh, drive over these. We don’t have time to clean up this mess.”
	We all obeyed immediately. Nobody was really covered in blood, but I felt disgusting and dirty so I was very anxious to get out of here. Besides, Zombie stench was a lot like cigarette smoke, it clung in the air and dug its way to the fibers of every piece of clothing you were wearing. I didn’t want my hair smelling like foul death for the next two days. 
	I reached out my hand to open the Hummer door when it was abruptly snatched up by Hendrix. He whipped me around and pulled me to the backside of the vehicle. He was livid with me; that much was obvious from his hard-like-steel eyes and tense shoulders. 
	He pushed me back so that I was pinned against the trunk and he towered above me, obviously trying to intimidate me. 
Too bad for him… okay it was totally working.
	“That was stupid, Reagan,” he growled out, slamming his hand on the window above my head.
	Digging deep for more courage than it took to fight Zombies, I bit out, “But it was my decision to make, Hendrix. If I want to do something stupid, that’s my call. If I want you to follow me, that’s my call too.”
	Hendrix’s gaze dropped to my lips for just half a moment before they met mine again, deep blue and concentrated. “I’m already following you, Reagan. You already made that call. The difference between me and you, I listened.”
	My skin was suddenly all tingly and shivery. My breathing became erratic and I swore I could feel the heat from his body wrapping itself around me and seeping into my skin, past my blood and deep, deep down in my bones. 
	Obviously, I was incapable of speech at this point, so Hendrix continued, “I’m not trying to play some ownership card here. I’m trying to keep us safe- all of us safe. This isn’t just about you and Haley anymore, you joined a family and we protect each other. Next time either Vaughan or I give an order, you follow it. Got it?”
	I nodded reluctantly, because he was right. I was realizing now how much easier Haley and I had it when it was just the two of us. Well, easier in some ways; there were plenty of ways life was much, much harder- like the never having weapons ways. 
	“Thank you,” Hendrix breathed, sounding so relieved that my eyes flashed up to meet his. 
	We fell into each other’s intensity and I thought I would drown. He looked down at me, tilting his face toward mine. My hands started shaking and I pressed my lips together to contain the emotion bubbling up inside of me. 
	This wasn’t like an almost kiss moment, or even like a surge of lust or anything like that. The emotions swirling back and forth between us were so much more than physical attraction, I couldn’t even put words to them- couldn’t explain them, even to myself. 
	Hendrix and I didn’t necessarily get along, but it was mostly my fault because I usually avoided him all together. I’d managed to slip away or find an excuse to leave whenever we ended up being alone- save for the few moments when it was just us and the Zombies. I tended to stick around during those moments. But I never let him have his talk with me, the one in which he wanted to remind me we would always be sticking together. I didn’t want to hear his reasons for changing his mind about going south. I didn’t want to get to know him better, or find out about his past or who he was before he became a Zombie Killing Machine. 
	I just wanted to survive. And I wanted to do that while also keeping alive all the people I loved and cared about. At this moment, that list included two people: Haley and Page. And I intended to keep that list short. The statistical probability of keeping everyone I cherished alive shrank if that list grew. So I was determined to keep it short- very, very short.
	Sorry Hendrix, you need to find some other non-infected, relatively young and healthy, still-capable-of-bearing-children woman to repopulate the Earth with. I was so not interested.         
	Still, even after all that I was trapped in this emotional moment with him and I didn’t know how to break myself free. 
	“Hendrix, get up here,” Vaughan ordered from the front of the car. 
	Hendrix let out a long breath of release and dropped his forehead so that it rested against mine. His arms encircled me in a hug as he pulled me tightly against his chest. His scruffy beard tickled my forehead when he rested his chin against the top of my head. And while I kept my hands firmly planted on his chest, I felt his heartbeat slow down, settling back into a rhythmic beat. 
	Just as I was about to return the hug, deciding that it felt nice and comforting- he dropped me, let me go. I stumbled back against the trunk and then plopped down into sitting on the bumper. Out of the hundreds of emotions Hendrix just put me through, the one that rang the most clearly was confusion. 
	Freaking Hendrix.
	I grumbled a curse and then sucked in a quick breath, holding it so I could listen to the rumble of engines that approached. I sprang up and sprinted around the car to watch the caravan of three SUV’s come to a stop directly in our path- the pile of dead Zombies laid between us.

Thank you for downloading and enjoying my Parnormal Pack. All of these series are continued with more books and more adventure. I hope you choose to continue Eden’s, Stella’s, Ivy’s and Reagan’s journeys as they get more exciting the deeper into their respective worlds you travel!
