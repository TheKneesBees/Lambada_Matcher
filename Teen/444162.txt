THE SEQUETUS SERIES GLOSSARY
Part of all the Sequetus Series books is the Glossary, a list of terms and words and what they mean.  When a word in the glossary has been first used in the story, it was shown slanted like this.  These were hyperlinked, to take you to the word definition in the Glossary.  The glossary expanded with new terms for each subsequent volume.
MEASUREMENT
In the Federation there is Standard Measurement, such as kinopacs, or Ks and pacs, but those, who have left Earth, may still use kilometers.
HOW THESE BOOKS WERE NUMBERED
This is an epic story.  By its nature, it’s big.  There are twenty-three books.  Each book deals with a specific aspect of the story.

Purpose: The purpose of providing this compendium book to the Sequetus Series is to give a reader all the reference data in one volume. It is a summary of all the previous glossaries and notes in the earlier 23 books. A ready does not necessarily need this volume.  It is provided as a luxury volume.  It also allows prospective readers to see for themselves the richness of the data that the Sequetus Series draws upon.
When the term Terrestrial appears beside a word or term in the glossary, of historical note, this means that it’s a terrestrial word, from Sequetus 3 – Earth – and the definition is a terrestrial definition, or historical note.  It isn’t a fictional term or definition.

The following is excerpted from this site:
http://www.bermuda-triangle.org
“Out there, in the Triangle, is the only true and accurate accounting of missing vessels.  Here on shore our files are very incomplete and poor.  Most lost vessels are smaller, private craft:  yachts, sailboats, schooners and cabin cruisers.  Many are suspect of being caused by hijacking.  Therefore they cannot warrant detailed investigations.  Because they are so common it would be equivalent to the FBI investigating every stolen automobile.”

Broadmatter Theory:  Broadmatter is that matter That’s so small that current instruments can’t read it, but it acts similar to a sea supporting molecular-matter that floats within it.  It transmits heat and ALL energy and in this way is very different from the concept of dark matter.  Broadmatter makes up the bulk of the universe mass, and is the reason why the universe is expanding at an accelerated rate.  Broadmatter ties in with space and time and without broadmatter there would be no space, no gravity and presumably no time.  Without it all other matter would collectively condense.

Defense Sortie Craft (DSC):  Craft likened to suicide capsules designed to singularly target an enemy incoming ship.  The single crewman may, or might not evacuate, just prior to impact.  The craft would come in at speeds low enough to not be deflected by the Acron or Proposhields.  Once the warhead was (armed with electromagnetic pulse - EMP) within the shields the DSC detonated.  The Acron and Proposhields would then be eliminated.  The atmosphere around the launch bays leaves the ship and makes the launch and landing bays inoperative.  Those caught in the bays die instantly as their bodies explode out due to zero external pressure.  The effected launch bays remain down and open for hours, enabling enemy crews to board and fight their way into the ship.  The EMP not only downs the shields, which enables external laser fire to be effective, but it disengages electronics, making electrical doors inoperative.  The DSC is a very powerful weapon, but has almost no return rates for its single crews.  Not used in the Battle of Sequetus 3.  Crews often have some external reason why they volunteer.  All crews are volunteers.  They and their families are always subsequently highly honored and decorated.  New-Earth miniseries

Dinosaur tracks:  (Terrestrial) There are instances of dinosaur tracks and human footprints appearing fossilized in the same mud strata, such as in the Paluxy River, near Glen Rose, Texas.  If these tracks are true, and they appear to be, then current traditional explanation needs re-explaining.

This would put humans here on this planet many millions of years ago.  That isn’t to say these humans were not wiped out with the same catastrophes that wiped out the dinosaurs, but it does show that there is an unknown archeology to be explained.  The above tracks are all found in Texas.

Enemy Agent:  (Terrestrial) It is interesting that there are reports of enemy agents on this planet.  For example, if one was to read the two versions of the same book by Robert Temple (Sirius Mystery) in the second version he has a preface explaining what happened to him after he published the first version book, twenty years prior.  He was visited and harassed for publishing his findings.  He wrote that he thought it was the CIA.  That may or may not be a correct conclusion, but it was notable that he was harassed for publishing a very scientific and well-researched book on visitations to the peoples of West Africa from the Sirius stars.  In another book called Forbidden Archeology, the writers researched an enormous amount of archeological finds that make no sense in today’s archeological model.  Here are many examples of artifacts – obviously human, civilized and made with machines, dating back millions of years, even billions, that that have been found on this planet.  Those who bring them forward get dismissed; find they have no work in the future at universities and so on.  
This author of the New-Earth Series recalls back when Chariots of the Gods, by von Danekin, first came out in Australia.  Teams of people went to schools to instruct students on the so-called inaccuracy of the book.  This author wondered at the time what was in the book that had these people so worried that they would visit all these schools stamping out this new thought.  
There are now teams of people who deride certain topics on the internet.  They cannot totally control what goes on the internet but they can make snide comments - anonymously, to stop people reading more of the topic themselves.  It will happen to this book series, the New-Earth Series, no doubt.  The question is, is this activity due to our own Earth agencies wanting to keep the information to remain unknown, so as to maintain control over the populace by avoiding a panic, or is this phenomenon from agencies elsewhere, who want to keep the data hidden?  To get more on this, one will need to read the New-Earth Series in full, and its sequel series, if one is truly interested to learn more of these people.  But make no mistake; such people are well trained in PR, as well as intelligence.  New-Earth miniseries

Microwave bluster:  A wave device, working on broad matter theory, which sends out a microwaves, which can be tuned to any known element, and through oscillating the broadmatter between atoms and molecules, it gets those molecules to drop their bonds and collapse in towards each other.  For example, if the microwave bluster was tuned to iron, which is a metallic lattice, then that lattice that holds iron together, and gives iron its strength, breaks down and the iron in the path of a microwave bluster beam, becomes no stronger than chalk.  Turned on a building, from above, an entire building can be made into rubble, and free fall into its own footprint.  Technically, this works on broadmatter, which is the unobservable particle that space is full of, that holds atoms and molecules apart.  Broadmatter is harmonized by atoms nearby, and in turn, holds those atoms apart and gives the element its strength and gravity properties, as well as preventing the molecules from falling in on each other.  Once the broadmatter is polarized, for that specific element, say iron, then iron loses the property of holding each iron molecule in its metallic lattice.  Iron then collapses under any strain.  The blusters can be tuned to any element, or elements.  So; all particles in the bluster’s path can reach the polarizing moment at exactly the same time.  For example, in a building, all the iron and steel, in the beams, girders, columns, and the reinforcing in the concrete, will give way at the same precise moment.  The building then collapses in a cloud of dust within its own footprint, just as in a controlled demolition.  If the bluster is tuned to iron and calcium carbonate, which are the main elements in concrete, then a superrise can be turned to dust in a few seconds after twenty minutes of polarizing.  The blusters draw their power from space itself, or the broadmatter within space.  Space has energy, and isn’t an absolute zero vacuum, but a mass of small particles that glue the universe together.  They measure a couple of degrees warmer than absolute zero.  It’s this energy of free space, unlimited, that the bluster draws upon. Earth Syndrome miniseries

Unified Field Theory – UFOs _ Germany WW2.  (Terrestrial) 1.  There have been claims by some – such as Witkowski a Polish military historian - that the Nazis had developed unified field theory.
He claims to have gained access to military top-secret German documents, that show the Nazis were experimenting with UFOs using drives, based on Quantum Theory or Einstein’s Unified Field Theory.  One example cited is the Bell, a Nazi experiment for transport.  It has been argued that when the Third Reich fell, the Americans took this technology back to the USA.

2.  Nazi-Bell has been described as what was found at a secret site - Wenceslas Mine facility - in Poland The story is that SS General Hans Kammler, under secrecy deeper than the Nazis nuclear research program, oversaw the Bell device, designed to be a weapon.
It was said to induce torsion effects in electromagnetic fields and thus control gravity.  Another such similar device was reportedly found in a Rhine Valley facility and appeared to be even more weapon oriented.  New-Earth miniseries

Universes:  By universes is defined as:  the universe of the individual.  There is the shared and common physical universe, but there is also the universe, of each individual life force.  This number of universes, could number trillions or quadrillions or millions timers more than that.  Such universes could overlap in common universes, and the greatest overlap was the physical universe.  In the physical universe, there is time, which may not exist, on the other universes.  The way to make the physical universe certain in the future, was to get agreement on the individual universes.  (Note:  This isn’t a new concept, but borrowed from a greater philosopher than this author, to explain this phenomenon.)  Juggernaut miniseries

Vicra Starn:  Born in Norway of Earth shortly after the Battle of Sequetus 3.  She was always interested in stars and UFOs.  She just happened to be at the crash-retrieval site of an interceptor in Norway and reported it to the authorities.  They visited her and no further action was taken.  She then was at another retrieval site and this time met and spoke to Federation troopers, and to a Boguard (Letone).  She informed Vicra’s parents of this, and they made reports to the authorities; and subsequently they died in a rail accident.  The Boguard Letone brought Vicra off planet; as he had been monitoring her for two years.

She attended Guardsman and Trooper basic courses and was adopted by Commander’s Care (a trust the Commander set up to deal with children who saw IFFCo activities prior to Intervention and who in turn were removed off-planet when other means wasn’t available, so as to prevent them from further harm by agents or renegade Earth agencies.)

They work though a camera set up in a satellite or other vantage point, by the company that sells the image.  It may be selling it to many lessees.  The image will change day by day, as per the scene it is viewing.  When the contract is up, the scene stops being automatically updated, unless the hirer wants to renew the hire of the scene.  Viewingplates are often large, but scenes are charged, for by the pixel, so the higher the magnification, the higher the hire cost.  In cruisers that move around through space, they have a lease timer that generally is shipped from the scene and so the scene is often not current, but very recent.  New-Earth miniseries

Warp Drive Coils:  “Before them was the coil that circled the entire rear perimeter of the ship.  It was the Warp Drive coil, and moved them from the now universe into another smaller universe which was only theirs, from which they could travel at accelerating speeds beyond the relative speed of light.
As free electrons surged into the coils, and then reversed, it created a charged field.  That field was interwoven with another field, which was woven around the previous field, like coils around coils.  The fields didn’t cancel each other out but instead created a greater field that extended over the whole ship.  The influenced was hyperbolical, increased by smaller coils around the larger ones.  Soon all the ship and its components would start to harmonize in resonance with the coil fields.  Then the final accelerators would play.  Around the coils small electronic particles would be accelerated.  They cut the field from time itself.  The ship could then be edged into the future or back into the past by nanoseconds.”
“Before them, was the dark grey void of space.  No stars, no coil, nothing.  All she saw was black, as though all before her, had absorbed all light.  Navia couldn’t determine how far the coil went up, but she felt it must have been sixty pacs.  She looked towards the sides, nothing.  It wasn’t as though the coil was black, or missing, but rather like a dark black fog shrouded the coil and it was prevented from being seen.  The blackness had no edges, no corners or center.  It felt as though you could simply walk into it to vanish forever.”
“The coil was a series of spikes, like millions of tiny tentacles they waved from a central band”
“The Drives occupy their own universe, or are at least accessed from a different universe.”   New-Earth miniseries

Warmsuit:  ® A one or two piece multilayered suit That’s thermostatically set to keep the body warm by warming layers separately within it.  The suit has ten layers with glass and metal fibers, which conduct energy from the inner to outer layers.  The suit has a thermal inducing battery within the lining.  This stores electrical current, so as to transfer heat.  As the suit’s outer layers cool to sub zero temperatures the suit uses battery power to warm the suit’s metallic layers.  The cold outside air contracts and shrink the suit fabric, trapping warm air therein.  As the suit warms, it then expands; allowing trapped warm air to ventilate out, permitting cooling.

Washington Flap:  (Terrestrial) In July 1952 there were UFOs seen over the capital of America, Washington, for weeks.  This was after LA had been inundated with UFOs following WW2 some years before, and after Roswell etc.

Notice in these three photographs, taken from this flap, that the UFO multiple lights all reposition correctly, in relationship to parallax.  
Hundreds and or thousands saw these and other lights in the sky.  Notice also that in the second two photos that there is a drop on the window pane and it is in a different location.  As these are stills taken from a movie, and the viewer is moving as well.  It appears from the movie that the film is taken from the window of a moving car.  The photographer moved, downwards, giving further authenticity to the pictures.

The Washington flap is the most prominent saucer flap in the western world.  Thousands saw the craft.  Jets were scrambled to intercept them, but as per the newspaper article based on a statement from the jet pilot, the craft outran the jets.

The President of the USA went on record in a press interview as stating that saucers existed and there was nothing much one could do.  The media coverage continued.  New-Earth miniseries

Zone, The:  (Terrestrial) 1.  Otherwise called the Zone of Silence.  The data given in Chapter 12 of Book 4 about the Zone is reportedly correct.  In 1989, when The Silent Enemy was first written, this region in Mexico was referred to as the Zone.  Now it’s referred, often to as the Zone of Silence.  Refer to The Silent Enemy for more data.

2.  A mysterious region in Mexico where unusual phenomena happen and where UFOs are reported as sighted, especially in the 1970’s and 80’s.  It became notorious when a missile from the USA unintentionally veered off from course and came down in Mexico, in The Zone.  The area is noted, for radios not working, microwaves not working, compasses not working, and extraterrestrial sightings reported.

It is also known for the strange colored cactus, purple and or red, instead of green.  Apparently meteors are drawn there.  The desert floor is reportedly littered, with meteorite stones.  Also, the reports indicate, that there is a much higher incidence of meteorite activity over the Zone, than in other areas.  The meteorite rocks that litter the surface vary, in type.  However, they are above the surface, not buried under it.

In September 1976, a 300 meter long UFO was reported, at 8:59 pm, outside of the small community of Ceballos, in the Zone.  The craft was rectangular.  Lights surrounded it, green to blue to white, pulsating light, with humming sound.  All the dogs in the town started howling.  Two-dozen residents gathered to watch the object at the outskirt of the town.  There have been many other reported sightings, of other craft, and even sightings of extraterrestrials, which fit the descriptions of greys, in this region.

CHAPTER 2
NOTES:
These notes are by the author and are observations he found of interest, to the story.  Much of the data is already in the story but here is more information, for the SEQUETUS enthusiast.
None of what is here, is written to convince the reader that the data presented in this story is true.  That is, the author isn’t saying a person can read minds, or that they can recall a past-life, or that a person really can move an object by thought.  However, others have or are saying this, and this is what is reported here.  These claims are the tapestry of data that this fictional story is written upon.
The following are the topics of the Notes:
1.   On Mars:
2.   Past-lives vs.  reincarnation:
3.   Life-of-the-world:

On Mars:
Ref:  The Martian Message by Goro Adachi.  See his book The Time Rivers 2003 for more data.
Additional data about Mars is summarized briefly as follows:
The Egyptian capital Cairo, situated next to Giza, derives its name from Al Qahira, denoting Mars, but also meaning victorious.
The ancient Egyptians called Mars “Horus of the Horizon” (Horakhti) which was the same name as given to the Great Sphinx.  Mars was also called 'Horus the Red' (Hor Dshr), and for a long time the Sphinx was painted red.
Just as the Great Sphinx is the hybrid of man and a lion, in the ancient Hindu myths, Mars is Nr-Simha, the 'Man-Lion'.
The term 'pyramid' derives from the Greek term pry meaning 'fire', as in Mars the 'fire planet'.  (Mars is often referred to as pyroeis in Greek.)
The apparent pyramids of Mars were photographed in 1972 by NASA's Mariner 9, the first spacecraft to enter the Mars orbit in history.  It flew over the region called the Elysium Quadrangle.
Carl Sagan commented that these 'becoming pyramids' did 'warrant … a careful look.'
In 1976 the Viking space probe photograph 35A72 showed the Face on Mars, situated in the region called Cydonia.  The rock formation resembles a human face staring into space.
In 1979, photograph 70A13 showed another peculiarity, a five sided pyramid near the Face.  Due to the geometric nature of the pyramid, many claimed this more indicated intelligence than the Face.  Then, other anomalous objects were found such as the Fort, Cliff, and City and Tholus.  When all these objects are mapped and interconnected intelligent geometric attributes become apparent.
While the data collected appears highly reliable, and involves some very serious research, backed by scientists, the results are always set up for ridicule. When this happens with sufficient force behind the ridicule, some suggest that there is a conspiracy of silence on the subject and that 'they' don’t want extraterrestrial artifacts on Mars taken seriously.
Other recommended research books on the subject are:
Graham Hancock, The Mars Mystery (New York:  Crown Publishers, 1998).
Richard C.  Hoaglund, The Monuments of Mars (Berkley:  North Atlantic Books, 1993).

Past-lives verses reincarnation.
The concept of past-lives is that the life-force, the spiritual entity that is the person himself, you, leaves the body upon death and finds a new human body at birth.  The concept is that a person goes from one human life to another, and that he or she doesn’t transmigrate to another species.
The concept of reincarnation is similar but broader than past-lives.  Reincarnation theory allows for the person to transmigrate to another species.  This is especially so that a person who has done something very bad during his/her life might be expected to transmigrate to another species, especially if it reflects the bad the person had done.  For example, a person who is a glutton may transmigrate upon death to taking control of the body of a pig.  This concept isn’t part of past-life theory.
In the NEW EARTH SERIES the concept of reincarnation isn’t part of the story, but past-life theory is touched upon.
Religions that use the concept of past-lives might be Buddhist in particular with its billion followers.
The concept of past-lives has also been found in many other religions.  For example, the Cathars of Europe were a Christian sect.  They believed that if their lay members did well during their life they could come back next life as a Cathar priest.  The Cathars were persecuted and wiped out during the Mediaeval Inquisition after an earlier Albigensian Crusade had failed.
Many Cathars were tortured, burned and killed.  They were wide spread and lived up as far as Holland, the southern Mediterranean and also North Africa.  Mainly they are known for being strong in southern France.  By the 13th Century they were targeted by the Pope for Inquisition.
It is said that Justinian II, in the Sixth Century as Emperor of Rome, of the Byzantine Empire, expunged all reference of past-lives in the Bible (545 AD) scriptures after a fortune teller told his wife she had been a witch in a past-life.  His wife was very young.  She had reportedly been a prostitute; then the Emperor’s mistress, before marrying him.  She had great sway over her husband.  In fact, it was thought she may have had more sway over the empire, than the Emperor.
Past-life theory had been around for five hundred years as part of Christian theology.  Before 545 AD, Pope Vigilius (the Christian pope at the time), was not against reincarnation or the concept of past-lives, and even ruled so, by refusing to outlaw a famous text regarding it.  The Pope claimed that the texts were within the teachings of Jesus.  The Roman Emperor Justinian had the Pope jailed.  The Pope managed to escape, but the ruling was then made, in his absence.
Past-lives and reincarnation were consequentially outlawed and expunged from much of the Bible texts, though not from every line.
There are many who believe in past-lives, and there are many internet sites, explaining more about the subject, as well as past-life regression and past-life therapies, past-life references in the Bible, and so forth.
The point here is that there is an overload of data and experience and writings on the subject, so it became an enjoyable part of the writing of this book, and the sequel volume set of books.
Life-of-the-world:
This concept is: that within a species, there is also a joint mind, run by a life-force that runs the entire species, not just an individual body of that species.  This concept isn’t new and finds itself in Shinto and other Asian religions.  This concept even goes so far, as to suggest, there is also a singular life-force over a planet, which has, as its purpose, the uniting of lower life-forces and medium life-forces, for a self regulating surviving planet.
There is a concept called Gaia, but this isn’t addressed in the NEW-EARTH SERIES.  However, the term Life-force-of-the–world, comes from the same observed phenomenon.
(The Gaia Hypothesis of scientist James Lovelock, is quite different to what is being used here.)
There is evidence that such a concept of one life-force, running many smaller bodies could be accurate.  For example, many lower life forms individually exhibit very low problem solving abilities.  However, when the life forms are in a group, they solve problems of far greater magnitude.
Bee hives, insect swarms etc., act as though under a group mind.  In Australia, the author has seen two meter high termite mounds, with perhaps a million termites living together.  He has observed flocks of birds turn in midflight, in a second, one hundred birds turning instantly all at once.  Under the water he has watched a hundred fish all turn instantly, as though all are under one mind and one instruction.
The author asked Australian aboriginals if a group of trees was a group of single tree life forces, or were they a group of trees run under a single command, one life-force.  He was always told that the group of trees was run as though they are one, and there is one spirit, in charge regardless of how many trees there were.
The author has scrutinized a swarm of wasps go after a single target, as though they are one.  He has beheld a pair of birds attack a larger animal, as though they had one mind working complex strategy and tactics, commanding both the male and female together.
In Japan, the religion Shinto means the way of the gods.  The author lived in Japan for ten years and met many Shinto priests.  The Japanese Kami, or god, can be one that looks after a whole mountain, or a river, or a valley or a forest.  There is one life-force – being big enough to call a god that oversees all life.  A figure that means either very many, that cannot be counted, or six million Kami represents the number of Kami in Japan.
This concept isn’t to be confused with the concept of the hive-mind or group mind, which implies that the group of individuals has a collective consciousness when they are together and through that consciousness are able to act.  The concept used here, is different.  It is that there is one mind, or one life-force that makes decisions for all its parts.
For example, in the human body we say there are a spirit and a body, but what there is really is a spirit, and a body made up of all these individual parts of smaller cells of life, and these smaller cells are capable of stimulus response actions, but the larger life force, you, the reader, is able to make complicated thought processes to make long term decisions, not just stimulus responses.  The concept used in this book is that there may be a hive of bees, and they are like the cells in the body.  However, they have one spiritual entity, like in a human, that instructs the cells what to do.  So, a swarm of bees will attack a predator, acting as one bee’s decision.  A school of fish will turn as one, and so on.
Expansion of the universe:
The universe was thought to be expanding with a big bang. The theory was that it was going to expand a certain distance outwards, then, due to gravitational forces, it would slow down; start to collapse in on itself, contract to a pin head and explode out in another big bang.
However, this isn’t correct.  The universe doesn’t exhibit this.  What is happening in the universe, is that the universe is getting bigger, and expanding. It is accelerating, in every direction, with no evidence that it is going to slow down.  The galaxies are drifting further away, and the stars within the galaxies are moving apart from each other, and the same applies to the molecules.
Hollow planets:
There used to be theories that this Earth was hollow.  The author never subscribed to that, but was interested in the data presented by Jim Marrs in his book Alien Agenda, Harper and Collins 1998.  It gave support as to why the moon was hollow.
The moon isn’t a natural satellite of Earth and the arrival of the moon could be what ended the last ice age only 11,700 years ago.  From the compelling evidence in Marrs’ book, it appears the moon may have arrived here about then.  The moon is made from a very different composition than Earth.  It seems to be older than Earth.  Marr’s book is worth buying and reading, cover to cover.
The moon is an anomaly.  We don’t get to see the reverse side of the moon.
There are also reports of UFO sightings being on the moon, even by the astronauts themselves.  Also, there are UFO reports from people observing the moon through telescopes; too many to take up here.
Brain operations:
The brain itself doesn’t have pain sensors.  Thus, it is possible to operate on a brain while the patient is awake.  There are films on this in medical libraries.  The scalp needs to be anesthetized, as it does feel pain.
Implanting, hypnotism and brainwashing.
Brainwashing a person by way of convincing him to do something by using persuasion is just plain marketing and sales techniques.  It is nothing more.  Brainwashing doesn’t exist in this sense.
What does exist is mental implanting.  This can take the form of hypnosis, but it generally is ineffective, trying to make someone do something that they wouldn’t wish to do of their own volition.  To get a person to do something against his or her own moral code drugs and or pain are used, along with suggestion.  Bringing reason and fear into the phenomena could make an assassin.  From the 1950s to the 1970’s some world government agencies investigated how to work this.
There has been some good material out there exposing the work of these agencies, such as:  In Search of The Manchurian Candidate by John D Marks 1979.  It is worth reading cover to cover, it is a full expose on the CIA and other US agencies, involved in mind-control techniques.
Another recommended book is The CIA’s Control of Candy Jones, by Donald Bain, 1976.  It is about how the CIA, through hypnosis and torture, turned a pin-up girl into an unwitting agent who would travel to Taiwan, do her work, and return back to the USA to a hypnotic debriefing, and forget all that had transpired.  This is a fascinating read and this technology goes back to the 1960’s.
More recently in the 1980’s there were reports that magnetic waves were used in pulse form in the Gulf War 1990-91 with Iraq.  Enemy soldiers were reported to have fled the battle scene after hearing voices of the almighty in their head, telling them to run.
Since then, we have had microchips no bigger than a pinhead to place in the body.  In the less mainstream media, there are reports that physical implants can be woven into the optic nerves, so that they can transmit the signal of the nerve, to a receiver who could view the image of what the person was seeing.  The operator could then transmit back into the optic nerve, by radio, what he wanted the person to see, even if the image was quite crude.
The point here is that humanity is going down this road already, and it isn’t much of a jump from there, to what is in the NEW-EARTH SERIES.
People moving objects:
It is commonly known that people have experienced having moved an object, or created an otherwise impossible situation into being.  There have been people in the past, who could claim to bend metal spoons at will and thousands of people would come to watch it.  Others reportedly could repeat this.  (There are also plenty of people willing to debunk this too.)
There are those who have claimed to move objects, using their minds.  There are those who would say this isn’t a mental feat but spiritual.  For this book, we’ll qualify this and say it is the same thing, though technically maybe it is not.  The mind and spirit can be dissimilar.
Telepathy:
(Tele Greek for far, apathe meaning feeling.)
Who has not thought someone was thinking of him or her, only to find a moment later that they are then answering their phone, to that person’s voice?  Many lay claim to this ability.  It is claimed that people who have high empathy, who are sensitive to others, have a high range of this ability.
Then, there is a phenomenon of not allowing your emotions (or thoughts) to be transferred to another.  That is called shielding.
There is too much written on this subject for it to be gone over here, other than it is a valid phenomenon of life, and a suggestion for further research, should you be interested.
Japan and Siberia:
With the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 the Entente powers (Britain and France) sent troops to Siberia in support of the White Russian army.
1918 – 1922.
There were troops sent into Russia via the northern polar religions and eastern Siberia.  The USA mobilized troops to both, and Japan sent 12,000 troops to Siberia.  China directed 2,000 troops upon the invitation of Chinese in Russia.  The Canadians and Italians also sent troops.  The Czech’s had an entire legion there trapped.
While Japan sent 12,000 troops, they had refused an earlier request, from the French.  The Japanese saw the opportunity of making a buffer state of Siberia.
Siberia is very much a Buddhist community and Asian, so there were ethnic grounds to make this happen.
The Japanese troops went along the Manchurian border, where they met up with another 70,000 Japanese troops from Manchuria.  When the allied withdrawal began in 1919 – 1920, the Japanese did not withdraw.
The USA placed intense diplomatic pressure on Japan to withdraw and under high demand the Prime Minister announced the withdrawal in October 1922.
While the allied purpose was to rescue a lost Czech Legion, and prevent western weapons falling into the hands of the Bolshevik Red Army, the Japanese were extremely anti-communist, and either had territorial aims in the region or simply wanted to set up a buffer state and to end the northern problem.
CHAPTER 3
NOTES:
Bermuda Triangle
More on:
Continued from:
From:  www.bermuda-triangle.org
“The upshot is that hundreds, perhaps thousands have vanished and their names will never be known.  They are forever in limbo, like an unsolved crime.  Part of the purpose of Bermuda-Triangle.Org is to keep a record of these.  Neither NTSB nor USCG does this.  Often people place notices in newspapers or at yacht marinas.  If you live in and about the Triangle, take advantage of In Search of .  .  .  and submit any reliable information on a missing vessel, such as newspaper article, classifieds, or yacht marina bulletin.  It may help in locating the vessel.  At the very least, it will provide a record of their passing.  The following list is compiled from various sources, mostly U.S.  Coast Guard bulletins and Lloyd’s List.
For more data on the above, please go to this site:
www.bermuda-triangle.org
The above site used to have the below material. That material vanished, as though the site had been closed down. So it is included here. It is just historical data on what ships and craft vanished in the triangle where.
Starting with the oldest maintained records yields the following litany:
The earliest registers list United States warships:
In 1780, the General Gates went missing. No British warship laid claim to sinking her.    Long after the American War of Independence, terse entries in marine journals continued to list disappearances. Curiously, many of them are warships.
A more mysterious occurrence than a merchant vessel, one might imagine, since they are sturdily built, heavily gunned, and manned by large numbers of well trained crews. In September 1799 U.S.S. Insurgent vanished, a 36 gun French built warship with 340 crew.
U.S.S. Pickering on a voyage to the West Indies in 1800, around August 20.
The U.S.S Wasp, which mercilessly pummeled British shipping in the War of 1812, mysteriously disappeared on a Caribbean cruise in October of 1814. This fate was rather anticlimactic to her last sighting, an engagement with the British brig Atalanta, which she won by capturing the vessel. She then sailed off on her next cruise around September 1 and was never seen again.
The voyage of the Epervier in 1815 was an auspicious occasion. She carried the peace proposals for the War of 1812. She left Algiers for Norfolk and vanished, delaying the ending of hostilities. Here is one instance where the possible phenomenon of the Bermuda Triangle could have played a crucial role in world politics.
The U.S.S. Wildcat, with 31 crew; the schooner Lynx, with 40 men; and the schooner Hornet (which had won a notable victory over HMS Peacock in 1812) all vanished in 1824. Incidentally, the Wildcat vanished after leaving Cuba in October. All of these disappeared in or about the area delineated for the Bermuda Triangle.
The first recorded merchant ship disappearance was in 1840, when the Rosalie vanished in the Sargasso Sea. Rosalie has often been listed as a derelict ship instead, confused with the very non mysterious drifter Rossini, and claimed to have never existed at all.  However, the British Maritime Museum does hold a record of her. She was built in 1838, of 222 tons. There is still some debate whether she vanished or was found derelict. The London Times of 1840 listed her as derelict.
Subsequent mysterious disappearances include another U.S. schooner/warship: Grampas in March of 1843 after sailing south of the Carolinas.
The passenger ship City of Glasgow vanished with 400 passengers after she left New York in 1854 en route to Liverpool (taking the southern course).
The disappearances of the British training brig HMS Atalanta in 1880 was considered a national catastrophe in Britain. She had departed Bermuda for home, with 290 young cadets and was never seen again.
In 1909 the famous world circumnavigator, Joshua Slocum, sailed out of Miami on his treasured yawl Spray, and vanished. He was considered the finest sailor of his time.  All of these vessels, of course, disappeared in a time when the Atlantic was very big and  when  many times a ship would be weeks between ports. There is nothing to connect them together except general location.
 By the early 20th century, Marconi’s wireless had proven itself. Warren Tute, in his Atlantic Conquest,  noted that “Wireless telegraphy was to deprive the sea of its ancient terror of silence.”  Yet by a strange irony it only gave it a new mystery—the mystery of missing Maydays and SOS signals. All the following vessels vanished while having wireless or radio communications. None left any sound to indicate what happened. The modern terror of the sea turns out to be something more aggravating than silence: a question mark. And all were on voyages that would lead them through the Triangle.

CHAPTER 4
NOTES:
REMOTE NEURAL MONITORING:
If the reader wants to know more of this technology, it’s also referred to as RNM.  Its most recent development has been in response to terrorist threats.  It’s reportedly being used in the USA, UK, Spain, Germany and France.  Also look up the case in the USA, of John St. Clair Akwel’s lawsuit.  It’s an extrapolation of the MK ULTRA experiments that took place in the USA from the 1950s to the 70s.
The RNM technology is such, that now there is no need for an outside agency, to monitor a brain or neural way, by detaining the subject.  One can become a subject to this technology by simply going online, with gaming machines, which use caps to monitor one’s brainwaves.
Internet gaming technology permits the user to forgo operating a computer mouse.  Simply by using thought over the Internet, one can control the outcome of the game.  Companies that manufacture these devices commercially are USA and Japanese based.  This technology also means that the user, can in turn be monitored, by simply using blue-tooth technology, that now has the gamer’s thought patterns measured.  These patterns are singularly the gamer’s own patterns, and monitoring them by supercomputers (more powerful than a brain) using satellites, means the following:  the subject can be followed using GPS tracking, and his private data, such as typing of credit card numbers at banks, can be monitored.  This technology is several years old at the writing of this book.
Claimed victims are reported to hear voices coming from unusual places, such as walls, ceilings and other unexpected locations.  They claim of extended high pitched ringing and varying pitch changes, to the ringing (as distinct to medical hearing problems.)
Messages can be delivered to a victim by ELF – Extra Low Frequency.  They can transmit from source to skull.  ELF can penetrate through rock, concrete and dense matter.  Today ELF can be delivered by satellite, and the theory is, that as all humans have their own separate DNA, they also have their own separate distinct radio frequency brain waves.
Today such surveillance could be very simple in theory, and perhaps one doesn’t need to register his brain waves via a game simulator in the I Cloud.  Today most phones are registered and tracked by GPS.  Many cats and animals have to be micro chipped by law.  Banks want to monitor the computer of their clients for security purposes.
Again in theory, within a small percentage of error, it’s relatively easy to determine the person using a phone, with that cat micro chipped by him, and with his computer linked to his credit card, is the person who has been intended to be monitored for brainwaves.  Thus, in theory, with today’s technology, anyone could have his or her brainwaves recorded without knowing, be tracked, and given intended thoughts that are not their own.
As far back as 1992 a court case was brought against the NSA (National Security Agency) of the USA by ex-employee John St. Claire Akwel.  The case describes the advanced technology back then, used to monitor remotely, hundreds of thousands of people in the USA and abroad.  The capabilities reported included access to an individual’s sub vocalizations, as well as images, from the visual cortex, and sounds from the auditory cortex.
For those interested in more, they should also research synthetic telepathy, artificial telepathy, and artificial memory.

CHAPTER 5

NOTES:  ON LONGEVITY
SYNDROME X
Syndrome X is a real condition, whereby bodies age at a very reduced rate, compared to the current human being aging process.
One recent case was of a girl who stopped aging at the age of four or five, until her death at 20 years old.  She was from Maryland USA.  It was reported that different parts of her body appeared to age at different rates.
Another experiencing this, was a six year old who aged no more than six months.
There is a report of a woman who has aged ten years as of her forty years to date.
The condition appears to have people aging one year for every four years they live.
The cognitive development of the people concerned appears, however, to be no further advanced than their apparent body age.
THE PITUITARY GLAND:
The pituitary gland is situated between the optic nerves, behind the eyes, under the brain.  It has three lobes.  The front lobe, or the anterior lobe – is to release chemicals that are responsible for the following:
1.  GH - growth hormone, or HGH - human growth hormone, or somatotropin, which brings on cell growth and cell proliferation
2.  Prolactin, which is responsible for milk production following birth.
3.  The follicle-stimulating hormone which develops the sperm and ovum.
4.  The luteinizing hormone that affects the ovaries and testis.  It stimulates ovulation, and testosterone and oestrogen production, and progesterone production (which prepares the uterus for pregnancy).
Another function of the gland is the release of hormones such as endorphins, which contribute to the feeling of well-being.
ANIMALS THAT ARE KNOWN TO LIVE LONG:
Bohead whales, or arctic whales, can live over 211 years.
In Japan, the koi, a domesticated variety of common carp, reportedly live over 200 years.
The longest living vertebrates on Earth are tortoises.  Galapagos tortoises live 200 years, and an Aldabra giant tortoise was known to have lived 250 years.

The ocean quahop clam lives 400 years
An Antarctic sponge lives over 1,500 in the cold ocean.
The Turritopsis nutricula jellyfish is ageless, as has developed the ability to cycle from a mature adult to an immature polyp and back again, thus avoiding death and possibly has no natural limit to its life span.  It does this when threatened.  It is the size of a fingernail and increasing its numbers in the oceans.

CHAPTER 6

NOTES:  THE LOCAL GROUP

The Local Group of galaxies, refers to the three major spiral galaxies of the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, the Triangulum Galaxy, and the forty or so smaller dwarf and barrel galaxies that are attached to these three spiral galaxies.  These galaxies all impact on each other with gravity.

The Small Magellanic Cloud:  This is a dwarf galaxy, meaning it is small and not spiralling like the Milky Way.  It was used by small vessels in the South Pacific to navigate by, and is quite visible to the naked eye at night.  It is irregular is shape, perhaps being interfered with by either the Milky Way or its partner Large Magellanic Cloud.  The Small Megallanic Cloud Galaxy is 200,000 light years away, and has a diameter of 7,000 light years.  It has several hundred million stars and about 7 billion times more mass than the Sun.  It can only be viewed from the Southern Hemisphere due to its inclination.  It is one of the Milky Way’s nearest neighbours.


The Small Magellan Galaxy.
(Galaxy photos from Wikipedia)

Andromeda Galaxy:  This has about a trillion stars and is 2.5 million light years from the Milky Way.  It is the largest spiral galaxy in the Local Group of galaxies.  The Milky Way has 200 – 400 billion stars by comparison.  It is visible to the naked eye on cloudless nights from Earth.  It appears more than six times as wide as the full moon when photographed through a large telescope, though only the brighter region is available to the naked eye.


Andromeda Galaxy

IC 1613 Galaxy:  This is a dwarf galaxy, approximately 2.3 million light years distant.  It is rarely seen by amateur astronomers due to its low surface brightness.  It is a bar-shaped structure, meaning it has an axis, and itsstellar population is quite old, perhaps 7 billion years.  It has a strong red giant branch and red clump populations.


Triangulum Galaxy:  This galaxy is a spiral galaxy, around 3 million light years away.  It is one of the most distant permanent objects, which is available to be seen with the naked eye.  It has about 40 billion stars, and a diameter of 50,000 light years.  It may be gravitationally bound to the Andromeda Galaxy.  The nucleus doesn’t appear to contain a supermassive black hole.

STATUES:

The various statues mentioned in the text can be seen here.  It was just by scrolling through some of these pictures that the author noticed that the statues had a wristband with something interesting on the band.  The readers can view these photographs for themselves and make their own conclusions.  The pictures were from carvings from the Middle East.  Different writers suggest these carvings represent different causes.  What this author notices is that the band, and the device or thing on the band, have a similarity.




Here the device on the wrist has ten divisions on a circular background.  While the picture below shows the device having three divisions on a square shaped face.  Notice the unusual device both subjects are holding, and that they are holding it exactly the same way and pointing it in the same manner.






Note that in both the above pictures there are wings present with the person wearing the wristband, with the device on it.

In the picture below, the device has been worn away, and its details are not visible.  The object that is being held isn’t so visible in the right hand.

The picture below could be the same person as being depicted above, as again the wings are present.  Notice the person on the right below without the wings (clean shaven), doesn’t seem to have the same importance as the one with the wings.

The fourth image below also has wings, though a different head style.  The wristband, and the device on the wrist, are present, though the details are not clearly evident to determine which of the two or more styles of devices are on the wrist band.  The fourth picture also has the cone shaped device, which is being pointed, held or aimed in the same way as in the first two pictures.

The author of the Sequetus Series makes no claims of what these devices might be, but they are being used, as an interesting backdrop, for the Sequetus Series story.





There are more examples of the same wristbands below, with some kind of imprint upon the band.  We see the same band and also the same person.




The next statue is the only one where the wearer is not depicted with wings.  The wearer is bearded.



While it is easy to dismiss these as being simply a religious relic, meaning they apply to some religious deity, with some kind of special meaning lost to antiquity, they are still an unusual curiosity, looking very modern, for their ancient place on these reliefs.

While the next picture of above isn’t extraordinarily clear, it shows that the face of the device on the wristband isn’t similar to the others.

CHAPTER 8
CREDITS (BIBLIOGRAPHY):
Below are some websites that may help those curious on the background data of the New-Earth Series.  These sites and many others shed more color on the tapestry of history upon which this series is written.  The following sites were selected; because they include the photos that I used as source materials in the Glossary and this also needs to be acknowledged.
Abydos Temple:

Key words:  Abydos temple, glyph, plane, Egypt, UFO, helicopter
Site:  http://www.ufocom.eu 
Notes:  Bilingual site.  The fascination with Egypt and some connection from outside of earth is more evident when one looks at this temple.  There appears the outline of a helicopter as well as a small stylized picture of a jet fighter.  

Key words:  Abydos, interior, Egypt, temple
Site:  http://www.all-about-egypt.com
Notes:  Abydos temple is cut into rock.  This site is about Egypt and is also a travel guide.  This is just about Egypt, its history, its kings and people.
Bermuda Triangle:

Key words:  Bermuda, triangle
Site:  http://ww.bermuda-trangle.org
Notes:  Perhaps one of the most professional sites of its kind.  It is very detailed.  It is the detail, which gives one the correct proportions to this phenomenon of the Bermuda Triangle.  This is perhaps the premier site for the Bermuda Triangle phenomenon.
Catal Huyuk:

Key words:  Catal, Huyuk, early, civilization, mystery 
Site:  http://www.ancientmysteries.eu
Notes:  Bilingual site but does have translations.  The site itself is very interesting and has its niche in this phenomenon.  As it is written originally in a foreign language, you’ll need some patience.  Your time spent is worthwhile.
Condon Report:

Key words:  Condon, report, UFO
Site:  http://ww.alienwar.com
Notes:  A professional site.  The creators are passionate about what they are writing.  The site has not just the Condon Report, but also alien abductions or various, and horrific kinds.  You can get lost in this site with the data.  The author of the site has his own story to tell and goes over much of it.  His experience is subjective and worth the time to go through the site.  This site is put together with a passion not seen in other sites.  Read the author’s subjective experience and you decide.  
Cydonia:

Key words:  Cydonia, Mars
Site:  http://ww.enterprisemission.com
Notes:  The above site has good data, and the wiki link below has specific information on where this face is found on Mars, its coordinates etc.  One will also find there the pyramid, fort and other named anomalies adjacent to the face.  
Dinosaur tracks:

Key words:  dinosaurs, man, together, footprints, Texas
Site:  http://www.ascensionearth2012.org
Notes:  This is a professional site and certainly shows that this is a real phenomenon.  They have even taken a slab of the clay of where the dinosaur footprint overlays the human print and examined the pressure cross section of the cut, revealing scientifically that this is a true event.  Of course this isn’t the only evidence of man-created phenomena found on Earth on millions of years old strata of mud.
Foo-fighters:

Key words:  foo, fighters, war
Site:  http://www.foofighters.greyfalcon.us
Notes:  The entire site is devoted to the Foo-fighter phenomena.  There are many photos.  Opposite is 1945 over Italy.  However foo-fighters were found in both the European and the Asian/Pacific theatres of war.  Both sides saw the phenomena.
Giodano, Bruno:

Key words:  Bruno, Giodano, philosopher, Italian
Site:  http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net
Notes:  This page in the hyperlink is perhaps one of the best summaries of this most interesting person.  Read about him and wonder how it is that he came to his conclusions those hundreds of years ago.  The reason this historical figure is included in this story and in the glossary is because he seemed to be several hundred years ahead of his time and he had an answer for all the mysteries that are find in the seven NEW-EARTH SERIES volumes.
Helicon, Mount:

Key words:  Mount, Helicon, Claude Lorrain artist
Site:  http://www.wikipaintings.org
Notes:  This painting is by Claude Lorrain, famous historical artist, showing the Muses on Mount Helicon with Apollo.
Horus:

Key words:  Horus, Egypt, ancient
Site:  http://www.pbs.org
Notes:  This is a site of antiquities and shows this picture of Egyptian sculptures etc.  While this site focuses on Egypt, some of the other sites below have coverage of Egypt and its off-world links.  You’ll get real raw data from this site.
Moon:

Key words:  moon, buildings, mystery, structure
Site:  http://www.ozpolitic.com
Notes:  What is best about this site is that there are two frames of this picture and the buildings are seen from different positions of parallax.  It is hard not to agree that these artificial looking shapes may not be buildings with some kind of landing bay to the front and left.

Key words:  moon, anomaly, mystery, structure
Site:  http://www.thelivingmoon.com
Notes:  More, showing anomalies.  These shapes or holes in the lunar surface – if they were on Earth they would be accepted as mines.  It is difficult to think of natural ways for these shapes to otherwise exist.  
Olympus Mons:

Key words:  Olympus Mons, Mars
Notes:  See the overflow from the caldera that is 85 km wide.  This is the biggest known volcano in the solar system.  This is a good site from Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which works in hand with NASA.

Key words:  Olympus Mons, Mars
Site:  http://www.marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov
Notes:  View from further out showing the size of the volcano and the curvature of Mars.  The lava overflow has a cliff height of 10 km.  The base is over 630 km across.
Pegasus:

Key words:  Pegasus, flying horse, Greek, gods
Site:  http://www.theoi.com
Notes:  Good site.  This is an enameled historic antique vase from Greece showing Pegasus (Hippo means horse in Greek.)
Philadelphia Experiment:

Key words:  Philadelphia, experiment, navy us
Site:  http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net
Notes:  This site again is very professional.  The page here explains the Philadelphia Experiment story in detail with the various facts that are known about.  It separates facts from conjecture.  The rest of the website is worth becoming familiar with and it presents more of the UFO culture.
Phobos:

Key words:  Phobos, moon, Mars
Site:  http://www.nineplanets.org
Notes:  This moon is around 22 km across.  Mars has two moons and its second moon is about a third of the diameter of Phobos.  This is a straight look at what is in our solar system and has good photographs.
Pleiades, star system:

Key words:  Pleiades, UFO, stars, mankind, history
Site:  http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net
Notes:  This star-system has been linked historically to most of the planets civilizations for some reason.  This site goes over much of that raw data.
Pleiades, Billy Meir:

Key words:  Billy, Meir, Pleiades, UFO, Switzerland
Site:  http://www.ufocasebook.com
Notes:  Billy Meir of Switzerland became a sensation in the 1990s when he said that he had been in touch with Pleideans who were visiting Earth in what he called light-ships.  Billy photographed many of these ships, as seen in the above two photographs.  The above is a good website for data on him.
Project Blue Book:
Key words:  blue book, project, air force, USA, UFO
Site:  http://www.ufocasebook.com

Notes:  This site is a general all round excellent site that gives details and an overview of the UFO phenomena with a historical perspective.
Project Grudge:
Key words:  project, grudge, UFO, USA, air force
Site:  http://www.obscurantist.com
Notes:  This is an overall professional site with a feel for good historical documents.
Robertson Panel:

Key words:  Robertson Panel, UFO, USA
Site:  http://www.ufocasebook.com
Notes:  This is one of the premier UFO sites.  It has all the classical cases well written and easy to understand.  It isn’t hard to get a quick grasp on the subject from here, and its history.  One can move around fairly easily on the site.  This one is highly recommended.  You can explore much of the history data that the New-Earth Series uses from this one site should you wish.
Roswell:

Key words:  Roswell, UFO, CIA, agent
Site:  http://blastr.com
http://www.roswellfiles.com
Notes:  A CIA agent states that the Roswell incident is real and actually did happen and the ex-agent is a whistle-blower.  On the second site, it is very professional and thorough.  There is also the case of the colonel from the US Army, who wrote the book outlining his job to reverse engineer the products that came out of the Roswell crash, such as computer chips, lasers and more.
Key words:  Roswell, newspapers, UFO, 
Site:  http://malin.hubpages.com
www.battleofearth.wordpress.com
Notes:  Both these sites are worth a good look at as they show more of the background of the Roswell story and enrich the tapestry upon which the NEW-EARTH SERIES is painted.

Key words:  Roswell, UFO, weather balloon, press release, 
Site:  http://www.roswellfiles.com
Notes:  This page – if it is still there – isn’t only showing two photographs of the so-called weather balloon remains of Roswell, but also an FBI document found in the FBI archives by an agent of theirs about the crash and the UFOs etc.  In addition to this is the actual blog, which shows how far UFO culture has permeated.
Sea of Tranquility:

Key words:  Apollo 11, moon, sea of tranquility, Buzz, Aldrin
Notes:  The landing site of Apollo 11 has had reports of UFOs.  Buzz Aldrin, astronaut who went to the moon explains the strange phenomena he encountered in space and on the moon and what happened when he reported it at the time.  
UFOs government:

Key words:  government, UFO, USA, Canada, VTOL
Site:  http://www.the60sat50.blogspot.com.au
Notes:  The New-Earth Series starts in 1989.  Then Area 51 was unknown, and thus doesn’t come into this story for several more years.  Here is a 1961 Avrocar, VTOL – vertical takeoff and landing craft, jointly made by the USA and Canada.
Unified Field Theory:

Key words:  unified field theory, Albert, Einstein
Site:  http://www.aip.org
Notes:  This site overall is about Einstein and his history, about his life and work.  There is a lot of data including this paper on Unified Field Theory from 1923 when he was in Germany.  Spend some time on the website.  
UFOs Germany WW2:

Key words:  Nazi, bell, Germany, UFO, anti gravity, unified field
Site:  http://www.mysteriousuniverse.org
Notes:  The site is about UFOs and particularly specializes in anti-gravity and how it works etc.  (These concepts are not used in the NEW-EARTH SERIES however.)

Key words:  Nazi, UFO
Site:  http://www.where-is-area-51.com
Notes:  Good site and it has another dimension to the UFO phenomenon.  There have been links with Germany and UFOs with the Foo Fighters, and also with Albert Einstein and the Philadelphia experiment.  This is now becoming entrenched in UFO culture.
Washington flap:

Key words:  Washington, flying saucer, UFO, 1950s, flap
Site:  http://www.ufologie.patrickgross.org
Notes:  This site has the whole story, how the air force followed the UFOs on radar, how they plotted them, with photos, how jets tried to intercept but couldn’t.  How the UFOs followed passenger planes etc.  Also there are the official claims that these were the result of temperature inversions, and how these came about.  It is good reading.

Key words:  Washington, flying saucer, UFO, 1950s, flap
Site:  http://www.ufoera.com
Notes:  Good site, well documented.  This is a must-see site on its coverage of the Washington flap.

Key words:  Washington, flying saucer, UFO, 1950s, flap, media, 
Site:  http://www.ufocasebook.com
http://www.ufologie.patrickgross.org
Notes:  July 28, 1952, not only the article itself but also the transcript is available.  

Key words:  Washington, flying saucer, UFO, 1950s, flap
Notes:  This is an interesting comic from Washington at the time about the flap.  There is a lot of data released under the Freedom of Information Act, and it is relatively easy to research some of these clippings.  This was the biggest UFO flap on record, and while it is down played today, it is worth knowing, as the downplaying of this phenomenon is what is taken up significantly in the NEW-EARTH SERIES.
Zone (Of Silence):

Key words:  zone, Mexico, silence
Site:  http://www.altereddimensions.net
Notes:  This site is professional and can show you more about the Zone of Silence of Mexico and much of the stories that surround it and its history.  The stories of unusual people/beings are found in the Zone, along with a lot of very unusual phenomena.  This is an excellent site, which allows the reader to get as much information as he can take.

Key words:  zone, Mexico, cactus, colors, red
Site:  http://www.crystalinks.com
Notes:  Again this is a very good site and with the basic data of the Zone.  The site has a general good understanding of much of the entire subject of The Zone as well as other related subjects.

CHAPTER 9
NOTES ON ILLUSTRATIONS:

Writing is a cultural art.  So is drawing and painting.  The artwork in this series is from www.dreamtime.com.  The artists and photographers and models that participated in these works are indeed very talented
DIAGRAMS:
The author has created maps and diagrammatic explanations to some of the events in these books.  These works are copyright to the author.
The author also needed these diagrams to refer back and continue writing.  So if he needed them, he expects you might also.
The author has taken the philosophy that he has a story to tell, and it’s the story that is most important, and he has to use pictures, as an aid to tell the story.
The Glossary is the same.  He initially constructed the glossary so that he could keep track of the events, as he built up the world of the Federation.  He has now included the glossary, as it evolved further in each book.  So in this book, you get the glossary, as it had evolved up until the end of this book.  Book 24 has an unabridged version. It’s here. He bought many pictures from www.dreamstime.com.  Those artists are very talented. He also used some pictures of galaxies from Wikipedia. The author also used some photographs of his own to also help tell the story.
The characters of the book seemed like real people to the author once upon a time, and so he wrote it that way.  They feel, bleed, drink coffee (or kalo) and they have emotions.  They have personality.  Given a certain situation the author felt they would act, as they had, because that was who they were.  He hopes this comes across.  But in saying this, no character in these books is designed around anyone the author knows or has read about.
Thank you for reading the SEQUETUS SERIES books.  We hope you become a fan, so welcome to a good reading experience.
Yours

CHAPTER 10

BROADMATTER
THEORY
ADDENDUM
This addendum came about due to logic.
BROADMATTER
We were taught in school, that space was empty and had nothing in it, but space.  We were also taught there were nine planets.
Both are wrong.
The sun gives out energy.  Energy cannot travel in absolute zero.  It isn’t possible.  Yet, it travels in space.  Space, in theory, should be absolute zero.
Yet, space itself isn’t absolute zero, but does have temperature.  If there was nothing there, then it should be absolute zero, Kelvin.
What is temperature?  It is a measure of energy.
We hear, and that hearing measures energy.  We see, and sight measures energy.  All our senses are measuring energy, nothing else.  Heat sensors in the skin, pressure sensation, even a full stomach, are all measuring differences in energy around us.
So, what is a photon?  We were taught it was a packet of energy that has the characteristic of a wave.
What could this really be?
A hypothesis that seemed to fit is that all space is full of tiny pieces of miniscule matter, far too small to measure with current instruments.  A molecule would sit in a bath of this tiny matter, which we’re calling broadmatter.  We call it broadmatter because it is everywhere in space.
The molecule sits in it like a basketball would sit amongst tens of thousands of pieces of polystyrene beanbag-beans in a bath tub.
Imagine the universe full of polystyrene beanbag-beans, and molecules sitting, within the polystyrene material around it, holding it away, giving it space from the next molecule.  It is this phenomenon we’re using, to explain broadmatter.
A molecule sits in this broadmatter like a vase sits in a box of packing fill; then further over is another molecule, or another vase in the box.  The distance between these is determined by the broadmatter or the amount of packing in the box.
We believe that gravity is a property of the molecule.  This is a property of traction.  Molecules pull against each other.
However, the molecule seems to also be subject to the repulsion of broadmatter.  The broadmatter repels molecules, and the repulsion is triggered by the molecular presence in broadmatter.
We further reason, that this broadmatter is absorbing a tiny fraction of the energy that passes through it.  The broadmatter can also be like a sea of roller ball bearings.  You tap one ball bearing and the energy of that tap will be carried to the next ball bearing, be shared and spread out, and follow all the laws of physics of waves.  The photon is really just the broadmatter, moving the next piece of broadmatter until it reaches your eye.  That is all energy is.
However, some of this energy seems to get absorbed into the broadmatter itself, and thus the broadmatter has temperature, even though we cannot see or measure it.  This is why space has temperature.
We also think that this broadmatter pervades all space, and if there is space, there is broadmatter.  It could be that, beyond the physical universe, there is no broadmatter and perhaps out there, beyond the broadmatter there is absolute zero, but then there would also be no space.
However, it is also possible that this broadmatter is an infinite tapestry that the universe is moving out into.  That could explain why the universe is expanding and accelerating out.  It is being pushed out by broadmatter.
We suspect broadmatter would have some slight mass.  So if you were to weigh empty space, it would likely register if one could measure it.
If broadmatter then has some remnants of all the energy that has passed through it, then this is why it measures slightly more than two degrees above absolute zero.  In a well advanced civilization one could, perhaps, tap into that energy and draw on it.
We believe drawing energy from this broadmatter might be available, similar to how a Tesler coil draws energy from the atmosphere.  One could, in theory, draw from the cosmos itself.  That is how it is done for this book.  Thus, UFOs have large coils, surrounding their craft, at their leading edges. If this theory of broadmatter is correct, then one could have infinite energy available.
A Tesler Coil requires a small coil to induce power through a larger coil.  We’re not suggesting that this is what determines the shape of a UFO, but we’re using this hypothesis for my story, as it fits.
Once broadmatter is accessed, it is less of a problem in how to harness it for power and production.
Broadmatter has mass, and wouldn’t be insignificant, amounting to most of the mass in the universe.  After all, space is huge.
It could also be that there is more residual energy stored in broadmatter than in all the suns and stars there are.
Broadmatter vs.
Dark matter
Dark matter isn’t exactly the same as broadmatter.  The theory of dark matter came about, to account for the observed gravitational forces affecting the Galaxy.  Broadmatter came about as an explanation of why space itself seemed to display properties of mass and in the presence of energy.
Dark matter is said to neither emit nor absorb light or other electromagnetic radiation.  The Broadmatter concept is the opposite; it does nothing but absorb and emit all light, energy and electromagnetic radiation that is observed to exist.  That is the fundamental difference.
Broadmatter is the medium where this energy is transferred.
Broadmatter and dark matter are both similar, in that they both account for the majority of the mass of the universe.  Dark matter is said to account for 84% of the universe mass.
The first person to infer that dark matter existed was Jan Oort, a Dutch astronomer, in 1932.
RESIDUAL BACKGROUND TEMPERATURE OF BROADMATTER - DARK MATTER
The cosmic microwave Background (CMB) was determined in 1992 to be 2.726 K.  It was further found that this temperature could fluctuate one degree.
NUTRINO
The neutrino is a subatomic particle that is small and isn’t charged.  They seem to be the resultant of electromagnetic radiation forces.  They play no bearing on the theory of broadmatter, though they have mass.  They pass through matter unimpeded.  They are created, as a result of radioactive decay or nuclear reactions or when cosmic rays (high energy particles originating in outer space) hit atoms.  It is affected by a weak force of nature.
GRAVITON
In physics the graviton is a hypothetical elementary particle, which demonstrates the gravitation in the framework of quantum field theory.  The graviton plays a part in broadmatter theory.
GLUON
The theory of gluons and quarks seem to obey the hypothesis of Broadmatter Theory.  A gluon is deemed to be an elementary particle and a strong force between quarks.  The gluon plays a part in Broadmatter Theory, especially in their color charge.
QUARKS
Quarks are said to be elementary particles that make up matter.  They combine together, to form what are termed hadrons.  It is the observation of hadrons that brought about the inference of quarks.  Quarks have color charge, mass and electric charge.
PHOTONS
The photon is said to be an elementary particle.  In broadmatter theory the photon doesn’t exist as such.  It isn’t a particle.  The photon in broadmatter theory, is an observed phenomenon of the interaction of broadmatter with energy, and anything set up to capture the phenomena of a photon is in reality, capturing the phenomena of the broadmatter disbursing its earlier absorbed energy.  This perhaps is the fundamental difference between broadmatter and dark matter.

CHAPTER 11

NOTES ON
WARP DRIVE
THEORY
The Warp Drives in THE SEQUETUS SERIES work on a theory.  It is very feasible.
The same phenomenon supports time travel.  Warp Drives move in and out of time.
As mentioned in Broadmatter Theory, time and space and movement of mass are interrelated.  Time is tied to space and change of location of matter.  You cannot have a change in location without space, and you cannot have a change in location without time.  These three are interrelated.  
In the second miniseries is outlined the basic concept of Warp Drive Theory when the books’ main character discovers the secret behind the concept, of moving in and out of time, and why its usage was kept secret.  
Like broadmatter, we saw that if there was travel on the scale we’re expecting, involving huge change of distances, with matter, then time would need also to be altered.  Travel in time is also possible, but we can see it only under specific circumstances, such as in the last miniseries, the EARTH SYNDROME MINISERIES.
We never promised in the NEW-EARTH MINISERIES that we would outline how Warp Drives work – we only wrote that Broadmatter Theory would be explained.
Broadmatter is a very basic hypothesis, and it works.  In the future, if you read the sequel series, which is already written and in its second draft, then you’ll read the concept behind Warp Drives.  However, we give you the right and freedom to disagree with my theories.
Thank you for reading this far and we hope we can take you with us on the rest of the journey.
