"O! that way madness lies; let me shun that." [William Shakespeare, King Lear]

Dedicated to an old friend - may you never truly "get it." 


Foreword
I once had a friend who was terrible. Now, don't get me wrong. They meant well and all, of that I am sure. My dear friend possessed innumerable positive qualities. Nevertheless, they were horrendous in one important regard. 
The issue, to put it in its most dramatic terms, is that I am a madman. It's not a full time deal of course. That would just be tiring. I do like to spice it up with the odd bit of cooking. Nor am I even that mad of a madman. Anyhow, whereas others merely speculated as to my derangement, I actually went out of my way to share this dark secret with my good friend. 
Boy, oh boy, was that a bad idea. Oh yes, we were friends. Don't get me wrong. They meant well, of that I'm largely sure. But God help me! What were they thinking? I swear they'd read a book on what not to do. I do not lie (I merely exaggerate beyond recognition), you'll find a few quotes of theirs in this very book. They will shock you! So odious, frightful, and unspeakable they were! Who in their right mind would utter such things?
Then, to my dismay, the truth dawned upon me. My friend was no isolated case. Far from it! And so, my dear reader, began my quest. 
How could anyone say such absurd things to the depressed, suicidal, and mentally ill? After great thought I have reached my conclusion. My friend was in fact suffering from multiple severe Stigma Disorders. In other words, they we're as crazy as a cracker box. 
When I began cataloguing these stigma inducing illnesses I naively thought I would find a dozen at most. Oh, how wrong I was! I have discovered forty two conditions in total (plus or minus three, I've never been good at math).
What's more, this may be but the tip of the iceberg. We are in the grip of a silent epidemic my comrades! Read on my dear reader, and let the scales fall from your eyes.

Chapter 1: Introduction
Humanity has long been faced by a great mystery. The riddle comes in a myriad of forms. It is spoken in a plethora of contexts, but in all cases it comes down to one simple question: "What is it with those guys already?" All the great philosophers have been vexed by this problem. Why do people do such mind-numbingly stupid things when they are capable of such greatness?
None have born the weight of this enigma more than the madman. Yet it is not as you may think. The madman is the one who ponders this puzzle the most. The sane among you will find this hard to believe. Thus I must turn to those who understand. 
To all those who have left their wits behind, I say unto you "I have been there my friend!" I do know how you feel. I get it. I know you cannot snap out of it, perk up, or be positive. I know you aren't an axe murderer, but I do understand why you want to throw your shoes at their head. I am aware of the awful truth just as you are - crazy people have to put up with bucket loads of crazy crap from sane people.
What is their problem already? Is something wrong with them? Could it be that not only is the sick person screwed in the head, but so is everyone else around them? The short answer is yes. Totally 100% yes. Those guys must be mental. Seriously how else do explain it? Only a lunatic could say such idiotic twaddle.
Blackmore's Compendium of Stigma Disorders attempts to do what no other book has ever done before. This work catalogues and explains the root cause of all this nonsense: Stigma Disorders. The madman's mystery has finally been solved. 
What is a Stigma Disorder you ask? Simply put, it is a psychological mess in someone's head that makes them say offensive, insensitive, or just outright weird stuff when confronted by someone with a mental illness. We'll be loosely focusing on what happens when the disordered meet the depressed (including those of the manic persuasion). However, everyone from schizophrenics to the obsessively compulsive will find familiar faces here. 
No doubt other stigmatized minorities will feel at home here too. The stupidity of Stigma Disorders knows no bounds. In fact these disorders seem to crop up in almost every imaginable situation where people are required to understand each other. A knowledge of the Stigma Disorders is essential for everyone.
The purpose of this book is to allow you, my dear reader, to diagnose and treat the poor suffering souls who are irritating the googly moogly out of you. As soon as you've labelled them, put them in a box, and pumped them full of drugs you'll feel much more peaceful. Why else do you think your psychiatrist chose their career?
Sit back and relax. Throw your shoes onto the floor instead of at their head, and inject some silliness into your shadows. When you're done, find the twit whose been bothering you. Stand up tall and in your best pontifical voice deliver them with your diagnosis. Then pass the nitwit this book before you say something you'll regret. As you run away I will do all the ranting and painful explaining for you.
The rest of this book describes and explains all the expressions of the seven main types of Stigma Disorder. Some of these conditions are mild, others are bizarre, and a few are just plain nasty. Read through from the start, or pick and choose as you wish. Some entries are short and silly, others are long and deep, but all of them will shed light on the madness that surrounds you. 
As a wise man once said, don't panic! Take heart and prepare to enter the bonkers world of the Stigma Disorders. Good luck.

Chapter 2: Medicinal Disorders
Medicinal disorders afflict anyone talking about, thinking about, singing about, or walking about in the vicinity of the mental health care system. Two great pestilences stalk every conversation concerning mental health - dysmania and dysdenial. Both shroud themselves with an aura of enlightened concern, yet they wouldn't know what enlightenment was if they spent all day eating light bulbs. Beware the two plagues (and the third bonus stirrer). You will do well to escape their madness.

Dysmania
Description
The dysmaniac (DYS- meaning abnormal, -MANIA  meaning extreme enthusiasm) is a dangerous fellow. First traumatised as a child, then continuously as an adult, and now just a wee bit more by me, the dysmaniac has developed a bitter and twisted view of reality. To them the world is a sick and dirty place. To them you are sick and oh so very dirty.
Like a hellfire preacher in a white coat, the dysmaniac can only see disease. All human behaviour is blight and mildew. Moral failures, spiritual experiences, personality differences, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and even being too healthy are all pathological scum to be wiped out. The dysmaniac has a raging desire to hunt you down. They want to see you drugged, bound, and made a lot less dirty.
Don't assume all dysmaniacs are doctors, or that all doctors are dysmaniacs. Far fom it. Many both inside and outside the linoleum corridors succumb to the foul pest of dysmania. We do not know why. They might have gone mad with medical power, maybe they are compensating for a deep self loathing, or perhaps they couldn't think of anything better to do. One day science will uncover the answer.
A key feature of dysmania is a strong fixation on abstraction. This obsession reaches its zenith at dimly lit conventions paid for with drug money. Here the dysmaniacs seek each other out like mobsters organizing a hit. Cackling and hissing (what? Am I a mobster? I don't know how they talk) they fight over the creation of abstract diagnostic categories. When the deed is done they bow in awe at the holy text by which they live, move, and have their being. All of life is then squished and squeezed so that it fits into these artificial terms. Mixed metaphors and bad imagery are thrown about with gay abandon.
So deep does the obsession run that the dysmaniac will become incapable of seeing human beings as anything more than abstract illnesses. No longer are they people with names like Phillip, Sammy, or Rose. Now they are bipolar, schizophrenic, OCD, BPD, ADHD, ADD, OTT, WTF and so on.
Once the label has been applied the humanity has been removed. People have emotions, but illnesses merely show symptoms. If the sick person is happy then it is a manic episode, if they cry then they are depressed, if they tell the dysmaniac to rack off then they must have an aggression problem. 
Whatever they are, they are not human. They are sick, sick, sick! And just a little dirty. They are only walking disorders which require banning from owning guns, motor vehicles and toothpicks.
To the dysmaniac the real world has vanished behind dark hospital curtains. They are ensnared in a cruel world of sickness. All problems are medical to the dysmaniac. Therefore, a Brave New World of apathetic medicated control is their only hope. If the "ill" don't like this then that's their fault, the uncooperative bastards. 
Advice for Patients
Dysmania is a grave illness. I theorize that it must be completely biological in origin. I think we'll try you on some pills containing 2-propylpiperidine, chenodeoxycholic acid, and glyphosphate. You might know it by its trade name of Poxyhate. I'm confident that'll cure it. I've no idea why, but it's as good an idea as any I've had. It's not like we need to test these things. Gosh! What is this anyway? Science or something?
In the mean time, textual hypnotic mind control therapy is as equally ungrounded so we'll give that a try too. My dear dysmaniac, lie down, breathe deeply, and relax. Stare into the sun and focus your mind. Feel yourself drifting, drifting, drifting slowly away. Now, it's high time you considered making a few changes in your life you sick demented prick. 
Firstly, have you ever never noticed that you've so shrunk the range of what counts as a "normal" that only two people on Earth can fit it? Trust me, you're not one of those two people. Is it not rather strange to you that we are all loony? Ponder this. Let it turn over in your mind as you sit there relaxed and waiting for the Poxyhate pills to kick in. 
Secondly, have you forgotten that modern life can be so bizarre, inexplicable and full of pain that you'd have to be crazy not to go a little crazy here? None of this makes us all ill or in need of medication. Which needs more fixing? Us or the world? Think about it. Hold it in your mind. You should be feeling the drugs now.
Thirdly, what is the ideal life? What is true health and well being? Is drugging a Van Gogh back into normality even a good idea? Why would we even want to be normal? Life is about more than symptom elimination. The best way to achieve that is euthanasia. Suffering needn't be evil. To strive is to suffer. To give birth is to suffer. To sit through a fifteen minute doctor's appointment is to suffer. Yet we do it. Focus on this thought. 
Could the pain of madness unlock gifts to those who would seek for them? Might the life of a madman end up being far more meaningful than yours? Imagine it, toy with it, spin it around in your mind. Can you feel the burning in your stomach yet? That means it's working. 
Fourthly, you cannot fix people in the same way you'd fix a broken clock. Electrodes can't teach you a mature outlook on life, get you friends, or satisfy your soul. Drugs cannot fix your marriage, bring a loved one back from the grave, or give you a purpose in life. Though I do hope they can cure dysmania.
Are you fingers twitching? That's it. Feel the bliss of Poxyhate. Stop squirming! It's helping you. All your symptoms will soon be gone. Oh, I forgot to mention, you may experience a few minor side effects. You weren't using your heart were you? 
Can you hear me? Hello? Hello? Is that blood? Oh well, we'll try you on Zyprexa instead. I hope you're not concerned about diabetes.

Dysdenial
Description
Despite being the opposite of dysmania, dysdenial is no better. The dysdenier boldly declares, "I don't believe in mental illness," as if it we're on a par with a religious leap of faith. Somehow the dysdenier sees the person who thinks they just flew to Alpha Centuri as being nothing to be alarmed about. Do they want to kill themselves too? "Well, who doesn't from time to time?" says the dysdenier. "Mental illness doesn't exist!"
The dysdenier gets so caught up in the world beyond the narrow confines of the dysmaniac that they end up trivializing madness. They joke saying, "I don't suffer from insanity, I enjoy every minute of it!" Slitting your wrists and thinking you're Napoleon presumably isn't the kind of fun they have in mind. 
"We are all different!" they chirp. "Some people are just at the far end of the bell curve." I don't know about you, but how extreme do you have to get until something is wrong with you? Is inescapable torment not quite enough? Do people somehow decide to involuntarily hallucinate? Are we just acting in a game when our whole world spontaneously implodes on us?
None of this bothers the dysdenier. They pass off their denial as enlightened intellectual sophistication. "Ha!" they say. "You've bought into all the hype haven't you? Don't you see that's all a big scam? I am too smart for that!" Then they point at the dysmaniac and Big Pharma. What more proof do they need? From the sins of a few they conclude that it is all a lie. 
Their enlightenment leads them to take a rather unenlightened approach to science. They happily, but unwittingly, join the ranks of creationists and climate change skeptics in their abuse of science. Knowledge gaps are taken as proof of scientific incompetence. Debates and failures are used to negate all the hard won knowledge we do have. The idea that even the best science starts out ignorant seems foreign to them. Instead they see it as evidence that it is all endless politics and word games.
And so the dysdenier counsels the mentally ill to throw away those stinking political power pills and get over it. If they then end up homeless or in prison then it must be their own damn fault, the lazy pricks. When those "well" people suddenly breakdown, hallucinate, and kill themselves the dysdenier looks the other way. Thus their denial can be seen for what it is - deliberate madness.
In severe cases the denial progresses to a state where they don't believe in any illnesses at all. Everything is a conspiracy foisted on us by drug companies, doctors, and the manufacturers of hospital toilets. Medicine, science, and technology are all just power games. Usually they die horribly from minor infections. 
The causes of this derangement are still in the realm of speculation. A three way combination of turtle neck sweaters, conspiratorial mind sets, and Arts degrees appears to be the biggest risk factor. If you suffer from any of these then please get checked. We don't want you getting sick.
Advice for Patients 
It may be possible to cure the ignorant dysdenier by a strong infusion of information. A basic biology course would help a few. Unfortunately this treatment will likely fail for the sophisticated sufferer who thinks they already know everything. Large doses of open-minded thinking may temper the more rabid varieties, if you can get them to do it that is. 
Dysdeniers must be taught to look at more than the abuses of dysmaniacs. If they cannot do so then they become little more than other side of the dysmaniac coin. Rather than turning people into broken clocks they make them into the rope in a game of tug-o-war. Neither has any compassion for real human suffering. 
I cannot see how dysdenial is any better than dysmania. Hopefully their intellectual vanity will compel them to cast aside their more obvious follies. One can but hope.

Dodgy Salesman Disorder: Type - Big Pharma
Description
A strange transformation overtakes many of those unfortunate enough to enter the world of business. All sense departs these lost souls as soon as the rancid smell of a corporate bonus fills their nostrils. Good intentions mean nothing in this world. Technically this is not a stigma disorder, nevertheless, the chaos wrought by its sufferers does enough to muddy the waters.
The practices of the one who succumbs to Dodgy Salesman Disorder are a horror to behold. No holds will be barred, no deed left undone, and all expenses will most certainly be spared. Inevitably this zombified shell of a human being will end up striving to create the problem their business is supposed to fix. The lure of profit is too strong.
The pharmaceuticals industry is no exception to this plight. They spend extravagant sums trying to induce dysmania in psychiatrists, yet their iffy tactics create a backlash of dysdeniers. The mentally ill are left standing in the middle, utterly perplexed.
Treatment
Regulation with teeth and exposure with shame are recommended. Morals could be helpful too, just maybe. Questionable lobbying, poor in-house testing, dubious marketing practices, and drugs which cause more problems than they cure don't do anyone any good, except the shareholders of course. It's time to snap out of it.

Chapter 3: Disorders of Compassion
All these follies are noble in motivation, yet they are a disaster in implementation. Thus the remedy for all of them is a gentle redirection of the patients energies towards more productive outlets. They are as annoying as itchy dust, but they mean.

Overconfident Empathy Disorder
Description
The clinical presentation of this disorder will be familiar to all sufferers of depression. The patient approaches the depressed person, puts their arm around them, then professes to share a deep understanding of their sorrows. Frequently this claim will earn them a hit on the head with a coffee mug.
To an untrained observer this reaction may appear unduly harsh. They'd probably be right too. Nevertheless, what they would fail to see is how idiotically insensitive this declaration sounds to the depressed person. 
Imagine we swapped the depressed person in this scene for an individual with one of the following: a brain tumor, a recently severed leg, or flesh eating bacteria under their skin. In any of these cases we would all rightly discount the overly empathic gentleman as a deluded fool. Chances are that he hasn't got a clue what it's like.
As you may have guessed, OED  results from a painful lack of self awareness coupled with an awkward misunderstanding. The reason we rarely encounter it in cases of missing limbs and the like is because the potential for misunderstanding is rather small. We know you're sick if you have no skin left. Likewise, even someone with the self-awareness of a brick finds its hard to be mistaken over how many limbs they have. 
None of this, however, is the case for depression. The bricks among us think they've been there. They mean no harm, but they are seriously misguided.
Example
Patient: 
"Don't worry, everyone feels like this from time to time. I know exactly how you feel. My [dog/ pet llama/ favorite cardigan...] recently [died/ got lost/ was eaten by hooligans...]. I feel your pain. That was a real bad few days for me, but I got through it. You can too." 
Depressed person's response: 
"Oh that's nice...." (Said slowly nodding while grasping for a coffee mug.)
Depressed person's actual thoughts: 
Great jabbering horn spoons! You fudge-wacker, you have no fragdaggling idea what I'm going through. Oh, your dog died, but you got over it. Whip-de-flipping-do! 
Poor you! It must have been terrible. Did you cry? Did you go "boohoo"? Did you want to slit your wrists? 
What was that shiznitz? No, you didn't long for death? Oh really, what was that sorry? You can't even comprehend what would make someone want to kill themselves? 
Then rack off! I'm in a living hell you can't even imagine. You wouldn't last one minute you weak willed moron. You think you know? Ha! You and your platitudes are useless my friend. USELESS!
OR
Oh my God when will this end! Why can't I handle it as well as them. Why is this happening to me? Oh! My [valued item] didn't even [meet some grisly end]. Perhaps I can't even handle normal life! Oh woe is me!
Advice for Patients 
If you still think you know what it is like then either you have OED, or you genuinely have been depressed. We need to figure this out. To do this we're going to have a good hard look at what counts as major depression. 
I warn you though. This bit will be heavy. I'm afraid I can't avoid that. Get a pen out, and let's see if you do know what it's like. It is crucial you get this. Clearing this up will help with a lot of the other disorders too.
First up, the majority of people do not have a mental illness. That goes for the most common ones too. From this simple fact we can take a guess that whatever you went through it probably wasn't major depression, bipolar, or any such thing. Normal sadness and grief might get you close, but not that close.
However, it is possible you're one of the unlucky ones. We really need to find out a bit more about you. Right here and now we're going to put you under the microscope. I was serious when I told you to get a pen out. Diagnosing any mental illness is a complicated business. This is quick and dirty, even so I hope it'll give you an idea.
  All-righty then! We are going to draw a graph of your life. People with bipolar and depression often plot their mood swings on a daily chart. Giving each day a score helps put it in context. When your moods go up and down like a rollercoaster keeping a chart really helps you know where you are. What we're going to do is put your life on their chart. My hope is that this will give you some much needed perspective. 
Okay, let's get into the details of this puppy. Bear with me if you get lost. Read it a few times if you have to.
Imagine an eighteen point scale - zero at the bottom, eighteen at the top. Every symptom you have will earn you points on this scale. One point is awarded if a symptom is present to a noticeable degree. Two points are given if the symptom is extreme enough to make life hard to live. 
So, it follows that if you have all the symptoms at an extreme level then you'll get a score of eighteen points. That is the worst possible depression you can get. If you have no symptoms then you'll get zero points. Life is fine if you're getting zero.
Now I want you to think of that time in your life that you call depression. Sit there for a while and imagine it as best you can. It isn't nice, but try to get back under the skin of it. 
Got it? Good. It's time to give it a score. Go through the list of symptoms below and give each one a zero, one, or two. Remember, one is if it was noticeable (e.g. five minutes doesn't really count, hours does), and two is if it was so bad you couldn't function properly anymore (e.g. you had to call in sick, you spent an hour staring at the wall).
Here are the symptoms:
1) Sadness, emptiness, or irritability.
2) Loss of pleasure and interest in almost everything.
3) Large losses or increases in appetite, or significant weight loss without dieting.
4) Disturbed sleep almost every day: insomnia, sleeping too much, or patterns that are just really out of whack.
5) Noticeable restlessness, or a noticeably severe reduction in movement.
 6) Fatigue, or a loss of energy.
7) Feelings of worthlessness, or extreme and even delusional guilt.
8) The inability to think, concentrate, or make decisions. 
9) Thoughts of death, suicidal feelings, and suicide plans, or attempts.
What did you get? Sum up your points and find out. Try to plot a rough graph for this time period. Think about how long it lasted. Did it peak suddenly then drop away fast? On your graph you should have a steep mountain. Perhaps it built up slowly then receded a few weeks later. If so then you should draw a long curving hill. I don't know what your graph looks like, but mine is a profile of the Himalayas. 
To officially class as being depressed you need at least symptom number one, or number two, plus four more symptoms. The condition needs to be bad enough to cause you significant trouble, so we'll say that at least one symptom needs to get a score of two points. Therefore the minimally depressed person is clocking in at six points on our chart (two plus four equals six!).
Wow you say, I got nine points. Does that mean I was depressed? Not necessarily. You still could of just had a really crappy day. One bad day is not depression.
Officially it has to be two weeks solid to count. In reality we are often talking months without release. More than that, it'll often strike again, year after year. In contrast, some people with bipolar get to live their life on the end of a rapidly spinning yo-yo. Two weeks is a long time in their world. They'll be endlessly crashing in and out of this every few days or weeks for years at a stretch.
You also need to ask about what was going on in your life. If your husband just died it was probably grief you experienced. Depression doesn't need outside triggers like this. It can just happen. The depressed person who keeps getting told that this is just a normal part of life is going to be one confused wee bunny.
I also need to point out that this little graph doesn't capture the severity of the extremes of depression. Sure, you got six points. Well whoop-de-do! That's small fry in the scheme of things. Have you had eighteen? Have you had a hundred and ten? Sometimes "two points" doesn't quite capture the level of disruption these symptoms can cause. When you live with this kind of depression a ten pointer day is almost livable, a six pointer day is okay, and a two pointer day is a blessing.
I should also add that that terms like "depression" or "mood disorder" don't really capture the experience. Perhaps a Ngyrah Total Body Funk would be a better term. This isn't about just sadness or moods at all. You might not even feel sad. Sometimes you can feel absolute nothingness. At other times all the symptoms are physical. It feels like you are being pulled in seven directions by aches, fatigue and agitation. Do you still think you know what it's like? 
A lot of other soft signs point to mental illness too. Having these doesn't prove anything in itself, but it does suggest that it's more than just a rotten run of luck. These include a family history of mental illness, seasonal patterns to the symptoms, and a first onset during your teens or early adulthood. It also pays to watch out for symptoms of other mental illness such as severe anxiety, hallucinations, delusions, flights of grandiose thinking, and incoherent speech to name a few. Mental conditions have a nasty habit of coexisting in the same person.
Now then. Does all this resonate with you? If so then I strongly recommend you do some more research on the topic. What we've done here is pretty rough. It will lift a huge weight off your shoulders to finally figure out what's been plaguing you your whole life (and it will give you a whole new weight instead!). Get professional advice if you think it's serious.
For the rest of you, this only loosely matches your experience at best. Whatever you went through it probably wasn't depression.  I don't know where your worst day scored, or how long it lasted, but I ask you to keep it in mind next time you say you've been there. 
If the worst you've seen was a day touching ten points, then consider what it would be like to live with that for half a year. Was the worst you've ever had less than six? You don't know what it's like. Never suffered worse than two? Your worst nightmare was a good day. Please shut up.

Maladaptive Instinctual Smothering
Description
Females in particular have a hardwired need to mother anything that looks needy and helpless. Usually this desire is unleashed upon small children, unwitting animals, and inanimate objects. Aeons of evolution have hyper-selected for this behaviour with good reason. Someone had to care about the kids. No one else wanted them. 
However, some individuals receive excessive numbers of the mothering genes. Beware of them! Watch out least you look needy. Fear for your life if you are endowed with a cutesy round face. For Jove's sake try not to be an injured baby hedgehog. The lullabies are intolerable! Who can withstand the barrage of cuddly toys! Watch out, watch out my friend, the super-mother will smother you to death! 
Example
Super-mother:
"Oh my God! You're depressed! That's so sad. Are you okay? It must be horrible. Do you want a lollipop? Anything you need I'll get it for you. Anything, anything, anything at all! Don't you lift a finger. You can't, my little cutesy-wootsie, sicky-wicky, saddy-waddy, friendy-wendy! You need me."
Sick person's response:
"I'm fine really. Thanks." (Said backing away in mortal terror.)
OR
"Sure, I'd love a lollipop. I like orange flavor, lime's okay, but not banana. Got it? A hot coco and a bed time story would be nice too. Oh, and can you do my job for me?"
Sick person's actual thoughts:
Stop patronizing me! What am I? A quadriplegic being fed through a tube? 
OR
Damn right you better give me a lollipop. That's the least you could do you ungrateful cow.
Advice for Patients
Calm down! I know I'm cute, but please step away! I can only drink so many hot cocoas in an hour, and I never liked nursery rhymes to begin with. Why do think this is helping me?
Oh, I'm sorry. The attention is nice. I really do appreciate it. The thing is, being treated like you're a cot case who doesn't know how to wipe their own nose can get irritating to say the least. 
More importantly feeling autonomous and in control of our own lives is a life saver in itself. We all need help from time to time, but dependence is soul destroying. Don't rob us of what we need most.
Your supercharged powers of caring need not be a burden. The great dynamo of cuddliness within you must be harnessed and channeled. Then you shall be able to play nurse like no one has ever played nurse before. Should you fail then it will destroy us all. The whole world shall be reduced to a smoldering pile of novelty cushions and tissue boxes. May God have mercy on our souls.

Delusional Compulsive Advice Syndrome
Description
DCAS is one of a number of Bad Advice Disorders. Debate rages over whether this is a separate disorder, or if it is simply the male expression of Maladaptive Instinctual Smothering. Nevertheless, we shall proceed with the current classification due to their divergent clinical outcomes. 
The syndrome is believed to arise out of the male desire to fix other people as if they were broken lawn mowers or leaky toilets. This becomes problematic for same reason that most of their DIY projects fail miserably - they're a clueless idiot. Hence the Delusional in Delusional Compulsive Advice Syndrome.
Regrettably, the patient is too inexperienced to realise just how impractical he is. You should be very careful before presenting any difficulty to them. Their need to fix problems will compel them to offer up an endless stream of bad advice. If you don't act on it then they'll be offended. If you do act on it then you'll end up looking like their last botched attempt to build a tree house.
Example
Patient: 
"Have you tried taking up a hobby? That'll take your mind off it. When I'm sad I hug kittens. Want a squeeze? Wait! No, no, you should watch kids movies! Comedies! Inspiring dramas! Do a marathon! Punch a pillow! Drink Peruvian monkey bean juice! Shout happy words while standing on your head! Ha! I know! I've always wanted to test out acupuncture. I'll go get some nails!" 
Depressed person's response: 
"Please step away from me. I'm okay. I'll hug the kitten, but please put down the nails, or I'll call the cops. Please!"
Depressed person's actual thoughts: 
Ahhhhhhhh! Get me out of here! I'm too young to die!
OR
You see those nail holes buddy. Been there done that. It don't work. 
OR
Monkey bean juice you say? Maybe this will be the final cure to all my problems. I only hope it doesn't clash with the tantric healing crystals and my daily fifteen kilograms of multivitamins.
Advice for Patients 
 It is noble that you want to help. If you've suffered from depression yourself then your compulsive ramblings will have a few nuggets of gold in them. Even if you haven't then you still might have a few good pointers. Certain common sense things like exercise, good sleep, and good nutrition do help. However, it is possible to go a bit too far. Especially if your an ignorant tool.
Unless you are a doctor then don't set out to fix them. You don't know what you are doing. We are desperate for a solution, and we might well follow whatever harebrained scheme you come up with. We'll certainly have come up with enough of our own. Be careful what you say. 
Don't abandon hope! You might not be able to shut up. Nevertheless, DCAS can be converted into a mild case of CAS by studying the topic before giving advice on it. I highly recommend this. We can't afford a world of unpainted jib board, crooked light fittings, and depressed people trying to cure themselves with herbal teas. Please get help before it's too late. You are a safety hazard!

Communicable Pollyannic Autophagy
Description
People resembling Pollyanna, the infectiously happy young girl, are a danger to society. They play a bizarre game known as the glad game. Every mishap in life is taken as a dare to uncover something to be happy about. The joy imparted by playing the glad game renders them irresistibly cheerful. Clearly they are a disaster waiting to happen. 
A repulsive overflow of happiness stimulates them to try and suck everyone into this glad game of theirs. Herein lies the danger. Being ditzy blonde little girls they are unlikely to explain the rules fully. The listener is thus left wide open to picking up a bad case of Pollyanic Autophagy. Instead of playing the glad game they will embrace the brute force of Positive Thinking.
The infected will then succumbed to repeated futile attempts to think positively. Each positive thought rammed carelessly through their head only serves to eat them up with self doubt and contradiction. Tragically, the infection drives them to respond by ramming yet more happy catch phrases through their head. A vicious cycle ensues.
Without prompt treatment the infected will enter into a fatal Panglossian crisis. In one last ditch stand they will force themselves to believe that all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds. The friction between this belief and their true condition will cause them to spontaneously combust within 24hrs.
Example
Contagious Pollyana:
"Oh cheer up old chum. My father always told me to think positively!"
Infected person at T=zero hours:
"Wow, sure thing pal. That sounds fun! It'll go great with my Peruvian Monkey bean juice, tantric healing crystals and daily fifteen kilograms of multivitamins. I can't wait!"
Infected person at T=48 hours:
Must... not... notice... the... pain..., I... am... happy..., I... am...
Depressed you fool! Moo ha ha ha! You're lying to yourself and you know it. You cannot defeat me. Nah ha ha ha! 
No! No! All... is... for... the... best... in... (fatal spontaneous combustion occurs)
Advice for Players of the Glad Game
Let me be clear. I have no problem with the glad game. If anything it seems like a good idea. Even so, I issue a strong caution to all players. The glad game must be played in a very specific way. Otherwise you could die. Pollyanas must be careful to explain this least they leave a trail of death and destruction in their wake. You wouldn't want to make people sad now would you my dear wee child?
The glad game is based upon the principle that every cloud has a silver lining. The game is to find that silver lining. One must not create silver linings that don't exist. That isn't a game, that is delusional.
Depression creates illusions. Creating more illusions won't fix it. It is better to smash the negative illusions by being aware of reality. Many positive things exist in reality that make for good hammers. Silver linings are out there. Simply trying to force happy thoughts into your head will back fire if they aren't true.
Saying, "I'm a successful, happy, and outgoing person," five hundred times won't change the fact that you're a miserable ghoul afraid of your own shadow. You'll only become all the more aware of your miserable ghoulishness. It's better to think of the advantages being a ghoul imparts. You can walk through walls for example.
One more thing my dear Pollyana. I do hate to burst your bubble, but the glad game can only do so much for you. Depression is much more than just sad thoughts. Extreme fatigue is a wee bit hard to fix by finding something to be hyperactive about. Brain fog doesn't clear by discovering things to think clearly about. Decay of the hypothalamus can't be fixed by celebrating the enlargement of your spleen. We love you Pollyana, but we need more.

Chill Pill Addiction
Description
Forget about the old Mary Jane and the coke. A far more insidious addiction lurks inside our homes and workplaces. Chill Pills are kill pills. Don't overdose. We're not talking about LSD or Miltowns by the way. No, we're talking about the mental fixation on the idea that relaxing can solve anything. Except walking up stairs presumably.
It only takes a few highs to get hooked. After that the new user will be constantly tripping out. Too little chilling will suddenly appear to be the ultimate cause of everything from the common cold to nuclear proliferation. Their response to all and any malady you present them with will be to have a cup of tea and chillax. It won't matter if you've just been shot and are bleeding all over their tie-dye. Chill pills can solve anything!
Soon they'll turn into a professional dealer. You'll find them behind a bead shrouded doorway down a dark alley. Their product - whale music. I wouldn't rule out Mary Jane, coke, and LSD either.
Example
Addict:
"What do you expect dude? You're  [in law school/ an astronaut/ a rat on a wheel/ a failed artist with ambitions of world domination/ Darth Vader/...], you, like, need to chillax man. Stress is, like, totally not cool. Take a chill pill, have a cup of chai and lie down there on the shag-pile. You'll be groovy in no time dude. Mind if I put on Soliloquy of Salmon? It's like totally my favorite."
Depressed person's response:
"Stressed! Ha ha ha ha! Pills! Ngrhaahuur Arrhyr! (Throws self through window and runs away delirious.)
OR
"Uh." (Collapses on floor and doesn't move for the next seven weeks. Possibly dead due to gunshot wounds.)
OR
"Ah whale music. Finally! I've found the answer. I just hope it mixes well with the positive thinking, Peruvian monkey bean juice, the tantric healing crystals and my daily fifteen kilograms of multivitamins.
Advice for Patients 
Telling a person struggling with the side effects of real medication to take a chill pill is insulting. This isn't the main problem though. In fact, the phrase "Dude, take a chill pill," is far more likely to be uttered by a sufferer of Involuntary Comedic Tic Disease.
That aside, apart from the dangers of cetacean crooning why should we be wary of the chilled out addict? The habit is incredibly strong precisely because it is half true. Therein lies the danger. It is one half to little. 
Stress does have a lot to answer for. We would all be better off with much less of it. Too much stress is in fact a risk factor for depression. Obviously a healthy use of chill pills is a good thing.
Addiction, however, is not to be encouraged. Stress is only the beginning of many problems. It's a long way from being the whole shebang. The addict must learn to loosen the grip of this idea on their mind.
Depression can take on a life of its own after you've gone in for a few rounds of it. Episodes can sneak up as unexpectedly as a sleazy door-to-door salesman. Little more than running out of toothpaste can precipitate an apocalyptic descent into the void. Even wrapping yourself in a six foot thick cocoon of cotton wool is no guarantee of serenity. The stuffiness will drive you nuts if nothing else. 
Like all pushers, the chill pill dealer trades in false hopes. Chillaxing is great, but we need oh so much more. You can eat chill pills until you froth at the mouth, but it won't solve all your problems for you.
Stop and think the next time you try to push one on a nearby moody storm cloud. Are they suffering from the stress of trying to run the rat race, or is their anguish simply inexplicable to you? If they're crying when they ought to be singing for joy then your chill pills are not enough. Thanks anyway. Don't do drugs (unless you're told to).

Kudbewuss Brain Parasites
Description
The Kudbewuss family of brain parasites consists of two main genera, the Alestyanota and the Alestyadontav. Both are highly virulent.
Several forms of Alestyanota exist, the most common being the hungriafrican strain believed to have reached pandemic levels after the first Live Aid concert in 1985. Strangely this variant is rare within Africa despite its association with the region. Other recorded species include porindian, dedmon, and ginga.
The Alestyadontav are equally contagious, but far more damaging. They are believed to lay their eggs in the amygdale where they secrete neurotoxins that make the host fearful of having unusual misfortunes befall them. Common species include cansa, astalka, and herpes.
The infection lies dormant until a period of stress is experienced by someone else. When exposed to these individuals the victim will uncontrollably utter phrases they haven't thought through. These sayings appear encouraging and cheerful without the cost of actually being so. Thus the vulnerable person is tricked into willingly engulfing the parasite. This then allows it to successfully infect their brain tissues. The Kudbewuss life cycle can then continue in this new host.
Example
Infected:
"It could be worse! At least you're not a hungry African AIDs orphan infected with rabies in a desert being hunted by cannibals. Do you think their complaining, do you, huh, do you?" 
Stressed person's response:
"Oh I suppose so. Maybe life isn't so bad. Maybe..."  
Stressed person's actual thoughts:
I'll bet they're frocking complaining! But no I suppose you are right. Life is easy for me isn't it. I'm not homeless, I have food in my belly, I don't even have crabs, but I can't do it can I? Pathetic. Good one, I'm such a loser, I can't even handle what lots of other people go through. Why can't I do this? At least I'm not a hungry African. I couldn't handle that either.
Advice for Patients 
Yes, it is technically true that things could be worse, but seriously, are you trying to scare them? Besides, suffering is suffering! The existence of worse suffering doesn't make suffering any less painful.
Perhaps your intention is to point out how badly they are failing? Hey, a hundred million Africans put up with living on dung hills, but they're happy. Therefore you must be monumentally useless if you're sad. Congratulations on making someone's depression worse! The Kudbewuss brain parasites have struck again.
Okay, I know you think that you are trying to point to something inspiring, or to get them to count their blessings. In a non-depressed state you might find this encouraging (especially if you're a masochist). Depression warps things however, so don't expect it to have the same effect. 
Far better would be to get them to actually count the good in their life rather than gaze upon the misery in someone else's. Point them to people who have successfully dealt with what they're going through. Why send them to examples of wretchedness and death? This is the parasites talking. You've been infected!

Chapter 4: Type I Ignorance Disorders
The ignorance disorders are the most common of the Stigma Disorders. Ignorance lies at the root of all of them (in case you didn't know). Therefore they are the most easily treated of all the disorders, in theory anyway. Type I disorders result primarily from a lack of information (as opposed to faulty information in Type II disorders). This lack may due to an external reason or due to an internal inability to see what's damn well right in front of them.

Discernment Failure Brain Implosions
Description
A brain implosion is very dangerous. Watch out! It can happen to anyone at anytime. In severe cases your prejudices will never recover.
Brain implosions can strike whenever a deeply held preconception is suddenly challenged by reality. They are most catastrophic when that reality has been sitting under the patient's nose the whole time. The sudden removal of support for their prejudice leads the patient's brain to collapse in on itself. They then stagger about in confusion while new structures are erected and their brain is re-inflated.
Individuals at high risk for implosions are generally unobservant, clueless, and just a little bit bigoted. An implosion often occurs when a mentally ill person reveals their illness to an at risk individual for the first time. If they do so too fast and unexpectedly then an implosion is unavoidable.  
Caution is advised when interacting with the at risk. You may seriously hurt their head. If they appear to be going into shock then apply an icepack, lift their feet above their head, and feed them information at a rate they can handle. Their recovery may take several days. Be patient.
Example
An at risk person who has just learnt that their friend has bipolar:
"What? I don't get it. You look fine. Your smart, funny, level headed, and accomplished. Surely nothing's wrong with you? You're not even drooling! I don't believe you! I dona beluv yu... idon booloov oo. Er doonboolovu. Edonblou. Eoblaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.... (Catastrophic brain implosion has occurred.)
Advice for Patients 
Education is essential to lowering your risk. The mentally ill are masters of the mask. Years of practice has lead them to build up a cool calm and collected persona to slip by unnoticed wherever they go. Oh yeah, and they're also humans, so they do tend to think, talk, act, and just generally be like other humans. Unless you can build this fact into your brain struts then mentally ill people will always be a danger to you.

Broken Record Syndrome
Description
Discernment Failure Brain Implosions (see above) occasionally fail to go to completion. For unknown reasons, after an implosion the brain can re-inflate using the same original faulty supports which caused the problem to begin with. Except this time they get erected with steel reinforcing.
This leads to Broken Record Syndrome not in the person recovering from the implosion, but in the person who caused it. In a complete DFBI the individual would only need to explain themselves once or twice to get the point across. The implosion would occur and then the correct beliefs would be put in place. However, when the old incomprehension remains in rigidified form no amount of explaining will ever have any noticeable impact. Thus the person trying to explain themselves will develop Broken Record Syndrome.
They can repeat the same phrase fifty thousand times and it will never be heard. Using twenty million different images and metaphors is futile. Throwing informational literature at the person achieves nothing. Eventually the broken record will shatter. It still won't achieve anything.
Example
Patient:
"Gosh, you're always like this. What's your problem? Why, why? I don't get it. What's wrong with you? Why, why?" 
Broken Record sufferer's response:
"Let's go through this again..."
Broken Record sufferer's actual thoughts:
Oh shnookerdookies! Is this just me or do they actually have the IQ of a tree stump? Argh!
Advice for treating failed brain implosions 
I don't know, seriously, what is it with these people? Check them for other stigma disorders. Give them an IQ test. Slap them a few times. Try not to slap them into a coma. It might feel good, but it isn't very nice to do that to people. 
Other than that I must admit defeat. Curing this affliction will be one of the biggest challenges human kind ever takes on. If we ever get around to it that is.

Ignorance Induced Time Blindness
Description
Time Blindness results when the patient's ignorance creates a psychic block regarding anything they don't understand. They think that everything they have never done themselves must be able to be completed instantly without any effort. Consequently IITB is the leading cause of missed deadlines across the globe.
The patient exists in a state of constant tension with others. Anyone who fails to meet their instant time standard will be incomprehensible to them. The psychic block is so deep that no matter how hard they try they will never be able to figure out where the holdup is. As a result, the patient will begin searching for some way to explain the delay without conceding the possibility that they haven't got a clue what they are on about.
IITB is the bane of people with depression, especially when it is combined with Overconfident Empathy Disorder. The fact that they can't get rid of their depression in under five minutes will infuriate the Time Blind. Their confusion becomes so great that IITB rapidly descends into much more severe conditions whenever it has to deal with mental illness.   
Example
Patient:
"Snap out of it! Get over it already! Just pull yourself up by your bootstraps would you. What's taking you so long!" 
Depressed person's response:
"Oh okay. Sure. I'll just go do that after lunch shall I? I guess I've just been so busy I haven't gotten round to it. That must be it." 
Depressed person's actual thoughts:
Earth to moron. Do you read me? Do you also tell people with cancer to stop being so sick? Do you think I want to be like this? Do you think I wouldn't have snapped out of it already if that was possible? Do you think I do this for fun? Are you calling me weak? Do you think you would be able shrug this off? Do you? Do you really, punk? 
OR
Oh why? Why? Why can't I just get over this? Maybe I'll break my neck with a dumbbell. That would be a fine way to snap out of this for once and for all wouldn't it?  
Advice for Patients
Ignorance removal therapy is the only cure for the person afflicted with Ignorance Induced Time Blindness. I'll do the best I can in this short space, but you'll need more. Best of luck. Always hold on to hope. 
Now, to say you can just "snap out of  it" implies that this is easily done. Apparently a slap on the face, a walk around the block, and a decision to stop being so silly will magically cure depression. Maybe it does work - if you're not depressed.
Unfortunately, the real deal is far harder. If you are lucky then it will run its course and never return. Failing that one can strive to change thought patterns and lead a rigorously disciplined lifestyle. "Snapping out of it" by sheer force of will like this is going to take months of bloody hard work. Even then the beast might not be tamed. Drugs, and electric shocks stronger than any slap you can give still may prove futile in the end. If dealing with this doesn't take effort then I don't know what does.
Please think hard about your ignorance on this matter. I know you can't just snap out of it. Removing your blind spots is hard, but it's worthwhile. Don't give up. We believe in you.

Fixated Egocentric Projection
Description
Solitary sea cucumbers are believed to be the only sentient creatures on the planet not to engage in egocentric projection, but they would if they could. Everything else does for one simple reason. At some point in their lives they all find themselves asking the question "What was that dude thinking?" 
A tried and tested rule of thumb in this situation is to assume that he was thinking exactly the same thing as you would. This is Egocentric Projection, and we all do it. The assumption that everyone else thinks, feels, and acts just like you can save a lot of time. It's a very helpful tool for the antelope on the go, or the aardvark in a bind.
Humans, as always, are the odd one out in the animal kingdom. We have the capacity to leave behind the thinking style of a raccoon and advance to far more sophisticated answers to the eternal question. Unfortunately, a lot of people end up staying put at raccoon level. In other words, they become fixated in egocentric projection. It is a sad, sad, situation which explains a lot about the world. 
Normally a child will pass through three stages of projection before emerging into the final stage in adulthood. With each step up the extent and frequency of the projection decreases. Only in the final stage is it regularly left behind. The stages are as follows:
1) The Ignorant Stage: They don't know any better. Toddlers simply lack the mental equipment to do anything else. They do their projection in a very literal way. If they know something then they think you must know it too. Typically this stage comes to an end by age five.
2) The Selfish Stage: This is the level of the child who thinks that the whole cosmos revolves around them. They've gained an inkling that others may actually be different from themselves, but they don't care. They reckon that even if we aren't all like them then at least we ought to be.
3) The Slothful Stage: During the teen years the emerging adult starts to find it increasingly difficult to believe that they truly are the centre of the universe. However, in stage three they are still too lazy to take this fact seriously. Figuring out what makes others tick is too hard. In fact, even applying that knowledge when they do have it takes too much effort. They've got better things to do. 
4) The Mature Stage: Only in this final stage is the projection routinely dropped. They take the time to understand the unique perspective of others and act on it. Some theorists expect all adults to end up here by age twenty five. Others say that it is rare before age forty, and rarer still beyond it.
So, those are the four stages. Fixation can occur in any one of the earlier stages. The Slothful level is the usual point to get stuck at, although the occasional imbecile gets trapped at stage one. Either way, the fixated individual is seldom ever aware of what they are doing. The brute fact that we are all different truly does elude them in everyday life.
The presentation of this problem is very similar to Ignorance Induced Time Blindness. The sufferer is unable to comprehend how anyone's experience of life could be different from their own. If someone struggles with something they do routinely then they just won't be able to get it. The mentally ill persons radically different experience of life is simply beyond their comprehension.
 They'll be forever expecting you to act exactly like they do, have the same problems they have, and solve them in the same ways. The tension between their expectations and reality leads to the same deterioration as seen in time blindness. Early treatment is obviously essential.
Advice for Patients
The standard diagnostic test is to examine your gift giving choices. Think back to the last Christmas celebration, or birthday party you attended. What presents did you buy? Who did you give them to? Why did you choose to get that particular gift?
The absolute number of gifts and their price is unimportant. The clinician is looking to see how well your choice matches the person it is for, versus how much you actually want it. For example, the man who buys the Turbocharged Tri-laser Semiautomatic XK1000 Spiral Saw for his grandmother is likely to have Fixated Egocentric Projection. The man's sister who bought Grandma some lovely strawberry bath salts might be okay, unless she also gave some to her brother.
By looking at your justification for buying what you did we can distinguish what stage you are stuck at. If you bought it for the sole reason that you liked it then you are stuck in Stage One ignorance. You have yet to discover that your own preferences are not universal.
Choosing the gift in the secret hope that you'll be the only one who will ever use it indicates Stage Two selfishness. All the men who buy motorbikes for their wives fall into this category. Other signs include off-loading old gifts you never wanted, selecting gifts out of spite, and stealing their other gifts when they aren't looking. 
Those of you in the habit of walking into the store and picking the first thing that catches your eye are stuck in Stage Three sloth. Chances are you bought them chocolates, socks, or a small gnome that sings Chinese lullabies. Half the time you're not even sure what it was you bought until you give it to them.
 Clearly none of you can be trusted to get presents that other people would want. Studies of re-gifting rates after Christmas suggest that up to sixty percent of the population may suffer from some form of Fixated Egocentric Projection at any one time. Please don't be ashamed of this shortcoming. You are not alone.
The best course of action will depend on the stage you're at. For the ignorant, get someone to challenge you to a game of hide and seek. When they instantly find you ask them how they done it. You might need to do this a few times for it to sink in. Here's a hint, it has something to do with what happens when you cover your face with your hands. You'll soon see what I mean.
Stage two selfishness is harder to fix. Try moving out of your mother's basement and getting a girlfriend. Try to find a girl who's very jealous and needy. Welcome to yourself in the mirror. You'll not want to be the centre of anything ever again.
To the slothful I can only appeal to your sloth. Appearances to the contrary, moving beyond this stage will actually save you a lot of pain and effort. Remember that time you didn't pick up anything at all from your bedroom floor for a whole three years? You know what I mean. It wasn't worth it after the decomposing hamburger wrappers gave you cholera. The same principle applies here.

Allohypochondria
Description
Hypochondria is the persistent belief, held in the face of the evidence, that one has a serious illness. Allohypochondria is the persistent belief, also held despite the evidence, that other peoples' serious illnesses are due to hypochondria. Academics still debate over which condition is more problematic. I know which side I'm on.
Allohypochondria (ALLO  meaning other, and HYPO + CHONDROS meaning below cartilage, which is where Greeks store their melancholy apparently) results from an inaccurate understanding of the signs of actual medical disorders, or plain old denial and laziness. The sufferer is unable to see the symptoms of disease even when they are visibly present. 
Pregnancy will be diagnosed as overeating. Pale skin and a fever will elicit exhortations to "Stop being so dramatic." Vomiting blood will result in cries of "Hail the old scarlet chunder!" followed by a hearty slap on the back.
Unfortunately, allohypochondriacs often make successful doctors. Their blindness gives them the capacity to diagnose at a rate of up to eight thousand patients per hour. Some have moved on to holding mass two second diagnostic revival meetings in their waiting rooms. Crowds upwards of one hundred and fifty people have been reported. At these meetings, the doctor will mount a small platform, raise his hands to the sky, and proclaim "You are all hypochondriacs. Be healed!" Everyone then jumps for joy, pays $60, and leaves. 
The mentally ill are doubly incomprehensible to an allohypochondriac. Amputees can persuade them by repeatedly pointing at the gap between their knee and the floor. It takes a while, but they come round eventually. Even the tenacious cancer patient might be able to win them over with x-rays, blood tests, and tumors the size of footballs. But what can the mental person do?
Pointing out that you have an overwhelming desire to run around the building screaming while playing the banjo is far from convincing. Sharing your suspicion that the CIA is putting thoughts in your head won't get you anywhere. Saying you cry yourself to sleep is only going to move you backwards. To all this they will respond by saying, "Ha! But your skin isn't green. Nothing's wrong with you mate."
Example
Allohypochondriac:
"It's all in your head. Next!" 
Mentally ill person's response:
 "Oh, so that's where it is. Ah, it all makes sense now." (Eyes widen and roll backwards. Steam spouts out the ears. Begins to rock gently while clutching their head.)
OR
"Uh." (collapses on the floor and doesn't move for the next seven weeks. Possibly dead due to catastrophic hemorrhaging.)
Mentally ill person's actual thoughts:
It's all in my head? No sh#t Sherlock! Congratulations on mastering kindergarten level brain science. Oh, and that cirrhosis of yours, it's all in your liver. Get over it. Your gout? It's all in your feet. Just let it go already. And that mind of yours? That's all in your head. Stop pretending. We'll both be better off without it.
OR
Am I right? Maybe they're right. Yes, yes, we tolds you so. You're making it up. No I'm not, I can't be! Yes you are! We knews it all along we did! How do you know? Oh my precious, but how do you know? He knows! He knows! But I'm not making it up. Go away! Oh no, what if I am a hypochondriac. Man that would be depressing. Oh but you are! No, no, I'm not. Leave me alone! Ha ha ha ha!
Advice for Patients 
Real hypochondriacs are very anxious that they might have multiple medical conditions, typically of the worst possible kind. If someone tells you that after fifty six solid hours of internet trawling they have diagnosed themselves with Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukemia, Cytomegalic Inclusion Disease, and Keratosis Palmoplantaris Adenocarcinoma of the colon, then you can safely say that they are a hypochondriac. That or a very unwell medical professor.
Everyone else is either just a wee bit worried, or they do actually have something seriously wrong with them. Hypochondria involves imagining symptoms you don't have. Trying to explain symptoms you really do have is very different.
The person who's recently confessed to you that they are a diagnosed manic-depressive is unlikely to be a hypochondriac. Unlikely as it may seem, it is possible that they are in fact a manic-depressive. Think about it. What would you need to do to believe you had this?
Firstly, you could mistake normal mood changes for the extremes of mental illness. If you don't know anything about the real disorder and you have never sought out a professional opinion then this is plausible. Would you be able to pull it off well enough to convince psychiatrists, ruin your life, and make you want to die? I don't think so. If you did then something would be seriously wrong with you, whatever it was. Either way you wouldn't be just "making it up."

Ignorance Induced Self Righteousness
Description
The sufferer of this disease has truly lost the plot. Unfortunately, I suspect somewhere in the vicinity of ninety two per cent of the population will come down with this at some point in life. Keep your eyes peeled! You can stop it before it goes too far.
The cause is believed to be a fatal ignorance about the reality of human limits. This blind spot induces subtle changes that warp the sufferer's understanding of responsibility. The end point is not at all obvious from the start, but it is as inevitable as a duck saying quack. 
Simplistic self help books are a common initiator of the disease. Unlike this book which is cynical, disheartening, and ultimately evil, the self help book will leave you filled with a desire to bring breakthrough to the whole world. You'll have never felt more alive.
The first sign of emerging pathology is a rush of power elicited by certain platitudinous catchphrases. Repeating them mantra-like, you'll feel an electric intensity unlike anything you've ever felt before. "I am the master of my own destiny!" you'll shout full of sparks. "Life will never throw me anything I cannot handle. Fate is what I make it!"
Little do you realize that you are falling prey to a megalomaniacal delusion that will end in darkness. This godlike inrushing of confidence is exactly that. You think you're God. You think we are all gods. The belief is unconscious of course. We're you to speak it you'd instantly repudiate it. In reality though, you will hold on to it until you finally learn one crucial fact - only God is truly the master of His own destiny, and even He has trouble.
Initially the madness is intoxicating, but soon you'll begin making the most heinous utterances of your life. A simple logical step will condemn you to this fate. If we truly can choose our destiny then logically any problems we face along the way are our own damn fault. Life is what you make it. Therefore failure, poverty, and death are all due to a character flaws. You can only blame yourself if they happen to you. 
Your messages may sound heartwarmingly uplifting, but the assumption is always there. Logically the darkness trials close behind. If only you were a better person then you wouldn't have these problems. You could change it all, if only you wanted to. Therefore, all your problems are your own damn fault.
Worse awaits! The delusion can progress if left unchallenged by reality. True self righteousness will set in like putrid gangrene. You'll enjoy pointing out others' problems then drawing attention to the fact that you don't have them. When you believe that you've been spared their fate due to your own strength of character you'll get a huge self esteem kick by doing this. They couldn't do it, but you could. Booyah! 
Soon you'll be proud of the family, ethnicity, and nation you were born into despite having done nothing at all to secure them. Anyone who looks weak, troubled, or disadvantaged will become the target of your increasingly patronizing advice to buck up. People on social welfare will become irritating to you. It's their own damn fault they're failures. You earned your wealth and good health. Why should you share with them? 
Once you have reached the point of writing letters to the editor advocating harsher punishments for crime as a deterrent, lower taxes on income as an incentive, and purges of social welfare system because you're pissed off, then you'll have reached the last stage of the disease. In a matter of days the metamorphosis will be complete. You'll finally have become an extreme rightwing politician. All hope for you has vanished.
See were your platitudes might land you? You will rip yourself and everyone else to bits with guilt and pretentious crappy advice. Beware, beware, beware of Ignorance Induced Self Righteousness! We are not God. Our lives are ruled by the roll of His dice and I swear he's rigged it.
Worst of all, the self righteous love to instruct the depressed.  The sanctimonious bastards reason that even if nothing else is under our control then surely our own minds and bodies are. Therefore those mental tornados that spin through our minds must be solely our own creations. Should we fail to get rid of them then we must be doing it on purpose. It's our own damn fault we're depressed.
Example
Patient:
"You can shape your own destiny. Life will never give you something you can't handle. You'll have a breakthrough into a better life if only you try. You just need to strive harder and then you'll leave all this behind. Come on, you can do it!" 
SOMETIME LATER
"Look buddy, I don't know what you're playing at. I've given you my seven step program for being awesome like me. Why are you still stuck? Get a grip already, okay. Truth is, you don't want to take responsibility for life. Do you? Ultimately all this comes down to laziness. I'm right aren't I? It's never been a problem for me pal. It's not acceptable. Cut the crap and stop wasting my tax money you lazy son of a @*%&#!"
Advice for Patients
Now that I've pointed out that you think you're God you'll be saying, "Whoa, hey, that's not me. I don't think that. I know we don't control everything." Well congratulations. This is your first step towards recovery. 
However, you are still too godlike in your own eyes. You think that even if we cannot control the world, we can always control ourselves. Surely this much is obvious you say. 
I agree with you, to an extent, but you still misunderstand our powers. We are not what you think we are. If you believe you are the master of your mind then try spending fifteen minutes without thinking anything. Can you control your own mind? You'll quickly discover that your head is full of uninvited nattering monkeys. Memories, emotions, worries, words, images, desires, and distractions stream ceaselessly through your mind all day every day.
Stop and watch the flow. Where does it all come from? Who controls it? Examine it and see. You sure aren't doing it. Arising and passing away. Arising and passing away. That is all there is. Making these monkeys shut up takes the focus of a Buddhist monk. It is far from a simple choice.
"So what?" you say. We still make our own decisions. If I want to stand up then I stand up. I make a choice and I do it. I am in control of that.
Stop and watch. The monkey mind does more that chatter. Observe. When do you come up with the reasons for your decision to stand up? Before you get up, or after? How often does it just happen by itself? You'll be surprised. The monkeys have more power than you think. 
Scientists with brain scanners have discovered that the brain can make basic decisions up to six seconds before we even know about it. We think we made a conscious choice, but the scientist already knew what we were going to do before we did. Who is pulling the strings in here? Our internal control is far from complete.
All of this is a bit misleading however. We like to think that there is us and then there is our brain. We control our brain. The brain does what we tell it to. This is not true.
The whole of our life is lived through the activity of the brain. Maybe a soul is hanging on in their too, but for practical purposes we are our brains. We are the whole thing, monkeys and all. If a monkey makes a decision that was you. No one else is in there. Any strength of character you have is encoded in your brain. All your habits, memories, desires, values, and convictions are created by this complicated glob of fat. They aren't just sitting inside it. They are it. Cut out a piece of your brain and they will disappear along with it.
If you disagree with me on this point then remember that this is an empirical matter. We can put it to the test. Go ahead and hit yourself on the head with a speeding truck. When you discover you can no longer recognize faces, hats, and tree frogs you'll see what I mean. Unfortunately you might not be able to read anymore. You might also discover that you've changed from a dull accountant into a compulsive artist. It can happen.
A lot can go wrong with this bone encased sack of angst. Well established medical conditions such as thyroid problems, strokes, tumors, brain injuries, dementia, and Parkinson's can mess things up big time. They also share the symptoms of mental illnesses. We have good reason to think that depression and other mental illnesses are basically brain disorders like these. The only difference is that we're still working out the root causes for the mental illnesses.
One day we won't call them mental illnesses at all. Instead of depression you'll have Circadian Clock Malfunction, Stress Induced Hypothalamic Atrophy Disorder, Dopamine Insufficiency Disease, or some such thing. A big chunk of mental illness will be made redundant. In its place we will simply have a few more brain disorders. The remainder will be all those issues that rest primarily on learned behavior and severe stress, or abuse.
Now, if we are our brains, and the brains of the mentally ill are malfunctioning then how can this be a failure of the will? The brain is on strike. The brain must prevent the brain going bonkers. No one is there to reach in from outside and do that. Should it fail to pull off this feat then we shouldn't be surprised. The brain was on strike after all. What else was it going to do?
Controlling a mental illness is a world apart from dealing with an external situation, or calming minor emotions. You cannot lift something with an arm you don't have. You don't depose a dictator by asking his country's head of state to get rid of him. A brain cannot exercise control if the parts that are out of control are supposed to do the controlling. This is asking the impossible. It is not a lack of character to fail to do the impossible. It is madness to blame someone for this.
If you want to see how difficult it is to control depression from the inside then picture this. Return to the chatter of your monkey mind. Now imagine that all the monkeys are abusive drunks. Not only that, the fur balls are screaming through megaphones while riding stampeding elephants with bells on. And they won't shut up. Ever.
Also picture all of your deliberate actions as if they were turtles crawling through peanut butter. They can't pull you away to safety. Nor can they take down the drunk monkeys. Your turtle minions keep getting stuck in the peanut butter, trampled by elephants, and eaten by monkeys. You have no choice but to stay there with your flailing turtles while the monkeys sling poo at you for days on end. You're controlling bugger all.
Character still does have a place. Often the brain strike is only partial. It can be partially controlled. A lot can be done when the brain isn't throwing a wobbly too. New protective circuits can be built up. Old destructive ones can be shrunk. More turtles can be made, and they can be trained in the latest monkey silencing techniques. 
Doing this then watching it work during the next crisis is strength of character. Far from mental illness being a moral failing, keeping an even keel through a full blown drunk monkey riot calls for character in a way that no other human experience does. They should be congratulated not harangued.
Perhaps you have got this far and are largely convinced. But! What about the problems that are learned. They aren't your fancy wancy brain disorders are they? They get themselves into it. Bad habits and destructive thinking patterns are what get these ones. For them at least, it is their own damn fault. You might even be getting annoyed at me. I am just out to absolve everyone of responsibility am I not? 
Well no, I'm not actually. Responsibility has its place. It just isn't in areas we were never responsible for to begin with. We can argue over distinctions between acquired versus biological mental problems, but either way we cannot leap immediately into accusing them just because they were not "born with it." 
If they were abused as children, raised by atrocious parents, and lived a life surrounded by criminally poor role models then can you blame them for having learnt destructive habits? What else could they have possibly done? They have a responsibility to change their ways now, but it will be no simple task. 
The only time the self righteous finger pointing is justified is when someone through sheer negligent bad behavior has worked themselves into a negative state of mind. The people who have landed themselves in a bad situation through incompetence, willfully destroyed their minds with recreational drugs, or who won't let go of past grief might fit into this category. However, now we are leaving the field of mental illness behind altogether. We risk slipping into the wrongheaded idea that mental illness is something we all go through. It isn't.
It is true that the mentally ill often do lack all the character strength they could have. Who doesn't? Nevertheless, their failure comes in the most difficult of circumstances possible. They face a challenge that you never have. If you have not been there then you have no right to judge.
Character is about what you make of the hand you've been dealt. It has nothing to do with controlling the uncontrollable. Failure in the face of overwhelming odds is no crime. Not trying is the only thing to be ashamed of. The self righteous commit a terrible sin. They point and say, "Ha! You have only yourself to blame!" when they should be saying, "There but for the grace of God go I."

Ignorance Induced Paranoia
Description
No other Type I ignorance disorder is more devastating for the sufferer than Ignorance Induced Paranoia. A typical case will progress through five stages terminating in the patient's own death. Clearly early intervention is a priority in this terrible illness.
In stage one, or the prodromal phase, the patient is confronted by someone claiming to have depression or some other condition that the patient knows nothing about. They'll be mildly confused, but otherwise seem fine. A bad case of Ignorance Induced Time Blindness is a key warning sign that worse is about to occur.
If the patient has to deal with this person for a prolonged period they will enter stage two, the suspicious phase. Their ignorance prevents them from ever truly accepting the individual's explanation for their behavior. As they search for alternative reasons they will often succumb to Allohypochondria, or Ignorance Induced Self Righteousness. However, if these options are closed to the patient then they'll be forced to search further afield.
Stage three speculation now sets in. At first their conjectures will be relatively innocous. For example, they might think that you actually have a cold, a late night drinking problem, or a secret gay lover. However, they'll be unable to substantiate any of these claims. Your repeated denials will force them to construct ever more elaborate theories to explain why you are holding on to your original claim.
Stage four soon follows. The patient's entire life is now engulfed by full-blown Ignorance Induced Paranoia. They are convinced that you are lying to them. What's more, they think they have discovered why. Like drawing a join-the-dot picture on a polka dot dress they will have pulled together a multitude of disconnected facts until they created a comprehensive conspiracy theory.
For example, one day the patient might see the individual coming into work late with a scratch on their arm, bags under their eyes, and smelling faintly of pine needles. Instantly the patient will conclude that they have returned from an overnight altercation in an ex-Soviet bunker in the Siberian taiga forest. Depression is merely a convenient cover story. Any doubts will be removed by the evasive answers they get during their aggressive interrogation.
Typical conspiracies involve international spy rings, nuclear weapons smuggling, and space pirates. Once the theory has become well established in their mind the final stage is only a matter of time. In order to justify how such an outlandish idea could possibly be true they'll begin to believe that they are a secret agent who has had their mind wiped.
In a desperate attempt to uncover their true identity they'll hijack a passing car, break into the nearest government building, and hold the janitor hostage on the roof with a spoon. When a swarm of suited men with pistols burst upon them they'll conclude that they are in the Matrix. The mess they then leave on the pavement below will not be pretty.
Example
Patient:
"Stop making stuff up. I know what you're up to. I've been watching you. Ha ha ha ha ha!
Depressed person's response:
"Oh would you look at the time. I have to..hmm... and yeah see you later!"
Depressed person's actual thoughts:
Holy crap! If we were in an ex-Soviet bunker in the taiga forest right now then I would....Calm down, breathe in, and breathe out. That's right. Best to pretend nothing's going on at all. Smile. Walk away slowly. It's time to create a cover story for this one.
Advice for Patients
Drastic intervention is needed now. You need 20cc of reality on the double. We don't have much time.

Chapter 5: Type II Ignorance Disorders
Type II ignorance disorders involve faulty information rather than a mere lack of knowledge. Therefore they can be more difficult to treat and far more annoying than Type I disorders. You can't just tell them the truth of the matter. Their faulty ideas must also be squished like the blood sucking mosquitoes they are. This is often done with a medicinal blowtorch and large doses of curry flavoured laxatives. It does nothing to help, but it is awfully good payback.

Psychophobic Hysteria
Description
This common disorder condemns its sufferer to a life of constant terror. Unable to distinguish violence from mental illness, the psychophobe is forever waiting for the day when a psycho-killer will finally bash down their door and cut them to pieces with a bread knife. Anticipating this fate leaves them in mortal terror of ever coming in to contact with a mentally ill person. Their fear is so overwhelming that if a mentally ill person ever does get too close to them then they'll beat the person to death. Consequently, the mentally ill live in constant fear of violent psychophobes.
A congenital misunderstanding of statistics is believed to be the source of their problem. The psychophobe doesn't realize that how memorable something is has no bearing on how likely it is. We all suffer as a result.
Naturally, the only images the psychophobe can remember are of blood soaked insane axe murderers. Reality is quite different. One quarter of the population will be violent at some point in their life. Statistically you're more likely to be assaulted by some "ordinary" road raging prick than by a lonely schizophrenic. Only paranoid gun nuts seem to feel about these statistics the same way that psychophobes feel about the mentally ill.
To make matters worse, sensationalist news reporters love a good psycho-killer. If only a single gory murder happens in the whole world then the slavering newshounds will ensure that you know about it. Hollywood will then be irresistibly drawn to celebrate the event in a blockbuster horror movie. Grandma's fatal night-time knitting needle accident and the one hundred million other ways most people die isn't worth so much attention.
The psychophobe's shortcoming leaves them vulnerable to many other phobias too. Similar effects are seen with their fears of being killed by plane crashes versus car accidents, shark attacks versus heart attacks, and terrorist gunmen versus unhygienic chefs. All of these mistake drama for likelihood.
The psychophobe, however, goes one step more. Not only do they think that all mentally ill people are psycho-killers they also think that whenever people act bizarre, violent, or deviant they must be mentally ill. As a result, the constant stream of news about cults, suicide bombings, and nudists will lift their fear to fever pitch.
The fact that most of these people are perfectly healthy cannot penetrate into the psychophobe's hysteria. They live in a black and white world. Normal people are good. Crazy people are bad. End of story.
The psychophobe seems to have forgotten that it doesn't take madness to create violence. They happily join in with the local football club riot, spend an evening brawling in the pub, and then enlist in the army where they get trained to kill people. None of this strikes them as unusual. 
Advice for Patients
The first step is to look at all the real risk factors for getting yourself killed or injured. I advise you to stop eating so damn much, refuse to stand upright, and to discontinue your current rate of aging. That should keep you safe for a little while.
Also, try not to get a mental health problem. Being mentally ill is far more dangerous to yourself than others. They have higher rates of accidental death, they get murdered more often, and if they're going to kill anyone then it's going to be themselves. The trembling psychophobe will do well to remember these facts.
Your hysteria allows you to get carried away so a few reminders are in order. As far as risk factors for violence go, mental illness is but one small part. If you want to predict where violence will happen then look for inequality. If you want to guess who'll be doing it then your safest bet is that it's a drunk or drug addicted male. 
You already know this. It is the reason why you don't go walking around dark alleys in bad neighborhoods at night. It is also why you have no such fears about entering a hospital, which will have a psych ward by the way.
Now, how would you feel if I told you that schizophrenics are twenty times more likely to kill someone than the rest of us? I suspect you would now start freaking out. You'd lock the door, bar the windows, and huddle in the corner with a shotgun waiting for the killer schizo horde to smash through and eat you alive.
What if I told you this isn't nearly as bad as it sounds? Even if they were a hundred times more murderous it still wouldn't be that huge a deal for you and me. Here is another statistical gem it pays to remember. A large percentage of a small number is still a small number.
Murder is incredibly rare. Depending on what country you live in, only around 0.001% of the general population will murder anyone in a given year. Assuming schizophrenics are twenty times that rate only means that 0.02% of them will commit murder that year. The other 99.98% wont.
Do you get this? You can pretty much guarantee that any schizophrenic person you ever meet won't kill you. Put the shotgun away already.
Now we can combine this with the fact that only around 1% of the population have schizophrenia. From this we can conclude that only 0.0002% of the people you met over the next year are likely to be schizophrenic murderers. You'll have to go through half a million people before you even find one. I don't know about you, but I'm not lying awake at night worrying about meeting that one person.
Alright then. Now we must examine your fear in greater depth. Most phobias have a small nugget of truth in them, but like a boob job gone wrong they blow everything out of proportion. For example, being afraid of spiders is a good idea up to a point. Some spiders can kill you. However, screaming like a chimpanzee in heat at the sight of an eight legged pinhead is a bit overkill. 
So then, can the mentally ill become violent? Yes. Does their mental illness play a role in that? Yes again. However, there is something we need to get straight here. Because you're so caught up in your fear of crazy people let's look at another modern demon - Islam.
Ever since 9/11 every Muslim I've ever met has gone to great pains to assure me that they are not a terrorist. It's practically a greeting for them now. "Hi! I'm not a terrorist," the say while shaking my hand. "What's your name?" 
So far none of them has blown me up on the sly either. Not that I've noticed anyhow. Maybe I've just been lucky, but I think it is fairly obvious that being a Muslim does not instantly mean you are a jihadist suicide bomber humming Death to the West as you wait for the nearest bus load of children. 
Don't misread me though. Islam is obviously linked to terrorism, you'd have to blind not to see that. Perhaps all the Muslims who shook my hand secretly wanted to behead me. Either way, the fact of the matter is that they didn't. Instead they gave me a meal, had a laugh, or enjoyed a good conversation. Like it or not, the truth is that most Muslims will never try to kill your sorry infidel ass.
Therefore other factors must be at work too. Not being a terrorist I don't know what they are. Perhaps seeing no future in life, watching drones destroy your village, and catching an episode of Bay Watch are the necessary ingredients. Maybe it is just a question of means. Either way something other than sheer Islamicness must be needed to create terrorist violence. Otherwise I'd be dead by now.  
Mental illness faces a similar reputation. On its own mental illness doesn't guarantee violence. They might be spewing foul smoke on the inside, but not every "psycho" is a psycho-killer. Other factors like childhood abuse, age, gender, personality, poverty, and alienation are also at work. Substance abuse is a huge factor in bringing out violence in the mentally ill. It does much the same thing for "normal" addicts too.
Again, don't misread me. Their illness can contribute to violence, but once you've eliminated the drugs, abuse and poverty they are often not much more violent than anyone else. The sad thing is that the mentally ill are far more likely to be in these situations to begin with.
We must get another point clear. We can't generalize. Mental illness ranges from agoraphobics who can't leave the house through to manic-depressives who spend their weekends as God. They aren't all the same. They aren't all as risky.
The distinction between the treated and the untreated is hugely important. A large portion of psychotic people can get violent, but if they are treated then they won't get psychotic to begin with. Effective treatment prevents their illness from even playing a role. All that leaves us with is the poverty, addictions, and abuse that contribute to violence in everyone.
Ironically the psychophobe is helping create their own nightmare here. Their stigma and discrimination keeps people away from treatment. On top of that it helps send them down the path of alienation, poverty, and drugs that only make matters worse.
What are the ill supposed to do if it is too risky to admit to having an illness? When they get fired by their boss, abandoned by their friends, and rejected by their family is it any surprise they end up losing control? Should we really be so shocked if their delusions shift to thoughts of mass revenge? 
Psychophobia has a lot to answer for. If you have it then please get help. It is a dangerous condition for all of us.

Psychic Germophobia
Description
The psychic germophobe's anxiety is much more narrow and personal than the psychophobe's. They are simply afraid that their minds might get infected with a mental illness. "Is it contagious?" they whisper furtively in the corner when they discover a "crazy" person has entered the building. 
I recommend you answer, "Yes, it's highly contagious. I think I'm infected!" then give them a big hug. Breathe heavily on them while doing so. Afterwards stumble away with your arms held out in front of you moaning "Brains! Brains! Braaaaains!" You won't make any friends doing this, but you'll make my day.
Advice for Patients 
Depression might be mildly contagious if you sit around listening to a depressed person all day, get all your opinions from them, and absorb their warped thinking style. But why the hell would you do that? Not even depressed people want to listen to depressed people. Let's face it, they are too depressing to take all that seriously. So don't and you'll be safe!
For all the other conditions out there only one thing will prevent infection. A little known fact is that the air is filled with invisible fish-like psychic madnomatic infectinators. Their goal in life is too crawl into your head and set up a small falafel stand.
You're job is to stop that. Find a suitable sheet of lead and block them! Make a nice hat that covers all your cranial orifices. Always crouch slightly below shoulder height. The infectinators won't be able to find you then. Everyone else will think you're nuts, but you'll know the truth. Oh, you'll know the truth! Ha! Ha! Ha! (Caution: this advice may contain some inaccuracies.)

Superhero Syndrome
Description
Superheroes have gone through hell (or in the case of deluded Supers, they think they have). Due to their super powers they've come out the other side unscathed. Take that depression! Ka Pow!
Sadly some of them misunderstand what causes depression. Similar to the chill pill addict they think it all comes down to stress. When they see a depressed person with an "easy" life they just can't get it. They've been through enough to make several small island nations hang themselves. Why can't everyone be like them?
Example
Superhero:
"Nothing bad has ever happened to you. Why are you so depressed? You have such a good life. What are you complaining about? If anyone has a right to be depressed it's me. 
My mother ran away to the circus when I was five, my father was killed in a duel with a turkey, and my brother married a stripper. As for me I lost all my limbs in a freak Dutch windmill accident, died seven times on the operating table, and got stuck at a Barry Manilow concert. You don't know nothing punk. I don't get you."
Advice for Patients 
Look out Super-anti-stress-man! You are at risk of developing Ignorance Induced Self Righteousness. Some people handle stress well. Others lose their minds beyond a certain point. Genes are implicated in this. Depression doesn't all come down to the knocks we take in life. Breathe in, stand strong, and remember - with great power comes great responsibility. Do not fail us.

Wannabe Syndrome
Description
Teenagers are by far the most common sufferers of this brain malfunction. The disease destroys the normal human motivation to be happy and replaces it with a desperate desire to look cool. Concentrating teenagers in large age-stratified clusters is thought to be a major cause. Without access to people of other ages for comparison they quickly lose touch with reality. 
Goths and Emos in particular end up with a very self destructive form of Wannabe Syndrome. In some weird perverted way they can come to believe that it is cool to have a mental illness. The cliché picture of the angst filled artist becomes their summum bonum.
In their mind's eye they can see the idolized drama unfold. In the darkness of her trendy loft the beautiful, but troubled young Artiste is fighting a losing battle against her inner demons. All seems lost. She holds a palette knife to her wrist.
Then, just as she is about to spill her blood across the floor in a final artistic gesture, who should burst through the door, but Carlos the topless male model with gorgeous hair. Love saves the day. She throws the knife away and a raunchy R18 sex scene ensues as the wannabe's teenage mind gets massively carried away with the details.
Then, in a five minute montage shot she returns to the canvas and wildly splashes red paint at it. Somehow it ends up as an extraordinary portrait of Carlos in the nip. The next moment she's winning a Noble Prize for Awesomeness at a rock concert. Several hours of crowd surfing follow. Then a bit more Carlos.
As an angst ridden artist I can tell you it doesn't work like that. The only topless guy around here is me, and he spends more time mocking me than saving me. The bastard. His abs are terrible too. 
Anyway, the wannabe is completely caught up in this beatific vision (of Carlos, not me). In a classic case of non-conformist conformity they want nothing more than to induce madness in themselves. Their pubescent hormone rollercoaster means that it isn't that hard to get the look right.
Usually addictions, self harm, and eating disorders are the easiest to pull off. With practice they can perfect a real dark and depressed look. A stylish manic groove isn't too hard to do either. Psychotic breaks take a bit of practice. Not many go in for that though. Believing your being hunted by the CIA doesn't really fit with the moody creative vibe.
Being teenagers they've yet to figure out that happiness is a lot nicer to live with than angst. Sadly, most real mental illnesses also tend to begin during adolescence. Trust me, the ones who've actually got them sure as hell wish they didn't. The wannabes only serve to confuse things for everyone else.
Nevertheless, the wannabe madness persists. Being in control of your life and happy just isn't all that glamorous. Better to be a drugged up homeless man, woops, I mean an emotionally struggling Hollywood actor any day. 
Example
Wannabe:
"Your only doing that because it's cool to be crazy. I'm doing it too FYI. See, I carved a complete Where's Wally scene into my butt checks. Isn't it wicked?"
Certified 100% genuine mental person's response:
"You done what to your what? Seriously, are you out of your f*@king mind? I'm not doing this to be cool. Do you have any idea what this is really like? What is wrong with you? 
Oh, and I think you forgot to add in Wally. Oops no, there he is! He was just hiding in the dark. Oh dear. I guess some art is better not seen."
Advice for Patients 
What a bunch of try hards. Go home. We won't be cool anymore if all you nuckin futs join in too. And for Christ's sake don't anyone call me an Emo! I will rip your head off (in a polite, controlled, and respectful fashion of course. What am I? An Emo or something?).

Schwachkopf's Disease
Description
The sufferer of Schwachkopf's disease thinks that all mentally ill people share the IQ of an ice cream cone. Bizarrely, this belief activates both the mothering instinct and delusional paranoia. The Schwachkopf (as we call them in the business) is exceedingly irritating.
On seeing a mentally ill person they will coo softly like a pigeon. Then they will approach with their arms outstretched, as if they were afraid of falling over. One meter away they will stop. Frozen in place they will bob their head from side to side much like a pigeon.
Despite this benign appearance, the Schwachkopf is far from caring. Nor are they a pigeon. To them mentally ill people are like incontinent puppies that will never grow up. Containment and control is the prime objective.
The Schwachkopf's tendency to treat people like animals will earn them many animal-like responses. Unfortunately the Schwachkopf will be too much of a dummkopf to figure out why this is. Therefore, they will conclude that all mentally ill people are in fact animals. 
After you've given them a few snarls and bites the Schwachkopf will shift into full containment mode. They'll grab a taser, don a flak jacket, and get the police on speed dial. A whole suite of odd behaviors will then follow. 
Every 2.56 seconds they'll say, "Have you taken you medication?" You need not be in the room at the time. They'll still say it just in case. They'll also attempt to impose strict information controls on you for fear of triggering an attack of madness. Asking them who won last night's big game will earn you blank stares. When you try to look it up online you'll find your batteries have been stolen. Plugging in to the mains will be a waste of time. They'll have cut the power too.
Eventually it will be all too much. The Schwachkopf will give up. Gathering around fellow Schwachkopfs they'll discuss the situation. Then, in the dead of the night, they will come and whisk you away to a secure facility. You'll be safely deposited in a padded cell where you'll be out of sight and out of mind. For the first time since meeting you the Schwachkopf will be able to relax.
Example
Schwachkopf:
"What are you doing? Put that stapler down! Don't touch that piece of paper. You're mentally ill. We can't let you operate something so dangerous. Here let me do that, you just sit in the corner and cry okay. That's a good girl. Did you take your medication today?" 
Mentally ill person's response:
"Oh no, I forgot! Oh no, I can't control my arms!" (Staples paper to the person's forehead then leaves. Gets fired the next day for obvious reasons.)
Advice for Patients 
Take heart! Schwachkopf's need not be permanent. This is an ignorance disorder so it's very treatable. However, if you don't get treatment I'll have to get my old straightjacket out. I always make sure to keep a few spares for people like you.
Two things need correcting in your tortured mind. Firstly, not every mentally ill person is permanently rendered as incompetent as a drug addicted barnacle. You'll never met the ones who are like this. They can't get in your way because they can't even get out of bed. And they can't get out of bed because some other Schwachkopf tied them to it.
The mentally ill are not puppies that can't grow up. We have successful treatments. Symptoms come and go. Episodes end. Sometimes they never return. Even during a crisis you might not even notice it. People can learn to keep things private you know. Their illness doesn't permanently turn their head to slush.
Secondly, mental illness doesn't make you as thick as a fruit bat. Some illnesses are associated with lower IQs, but others are associated with higher IQs. If you were bottom of the class at school then you are more likely to get bipolar. However, if you were top of the class you are also more likely to get bipolar. Go figure! 
Either way, IQ has only so much to do with competence anyway. Once you've got enough of it other traits become more important. If you want to be an outstanding success then traits like obsession and creativity come in handy. Strangely, it's the mentally ill who often posses these traits in bucket loads. 
The myth of the mad genius has a large chunk of truth to it. Genius after genius down through the ages has had a touch of madness. Many of the most influential people in history were "crazy" in one way or another. You wouldn't want to be them, but they were far from incompetent morons. 
So my dear Schwachkopf, you'd best think twice the next time you pull out your lasso. Even if you aren't trying to rope up Picasso, you're still dealing with a human being. Put away the rope and cable ties already. And for God's sake stop cooing like a pigeon! Is something wrong with you?

The Black Knight Complex
Description
The name of this disease derives from a famous scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. For those who've never seen the film I will recreate the key part using the timeless technology of words. Hush now, get some popcorn, and picture this. 
In the murky shadows of a forest in Arthurian England stands the Black Knight. He guards a bridge across a stream. No man may pass over it. Any who wishes to do so he defeats in single combat. Yet now King Arthur himself approaches. He wishes to cross the stream, but the Black Knight will not budge.
Arthur draws his sword and engages the Black Knight in battle. Steel clashes against steel. The fight is even until suddenly Arthur's blade slices off the Black Knight's arm. Victory has fallen to the noble King of England.
The Black Knight disagrees. "Tis but a scratch!" he says. "I've had worse." He takes up his sword and continues the fight. Arthur chops of his other arm and kneels to thank God for the victory. The armless Black Knight kicks him in the chest. Reluctantly Arthur lops off his legs as well. Unperturbed the now totally limbless Black Knight suggests they call it a draw.
The Black Knight who cannot acknowledge his defeat is the archetype of a particular psychological problem. The person caught up in a Black Knight complex is incapable of assessing the actual damage something has done. It is not admirable persistence. It is insanity of the highest order.
When it comes to mental illness, the Black Knight is the opposite of the Schwachkopf. Instead of thinking that all mental illness results in permanent crippling, the Black Knight considers it to be on the same level as a mild head cold. We all get it, but it doesn't last long. When it's gone it's gone for good. Just ignore it and carry on! You can't lose.
Mentally ill Black Knights find it difficult to continue this delusion during a severe psychiatric episode. They are far too busy entertaining other delusions. Nevertheless, when an episode finishes and stability returns they shout "Hooray I'm cured!" Then they throw away their pills convinced that they can do it alone from here on in. The outcome is tragically predictable.
Example
Black Knight:
"You're out of the hospital now. Enough already, you're fine. What are you taking all those pills for anyway. Nothing's wrong now. You'll be a drug addict if you keep that up. She'll be right. It's naught but sadness. I've had worse you know."
Advice for Patients 
Good luck. You're not invincible. May you never find that out the hard way.

Ostrichism
Description
Despite the name this is neither a disease of ostriches, a malady that makes people look like ostriches,  nor is it a sickness directly related to ostracism. No, this affliction doesn't even concern ostracized ostriches who look like people who look like ostriches. The sufferer of Ostrichism may look just like me or you (but to be honest, they look more like you).
What then is this scourge? The ill-fated sufferer of Ostrichism has their head stuck in the sand. We're talking metaphorically of course, they'd suffocate otherwise. Their metaphoric stuck head has been so rammed there in order to save them from great psychic distress.
So, my curious fellow, what grave pain do they thus shield themselves? Danger and threat is their dread. Fair enough too, you might say. Danger tends to be terribly dangerous, and threat is oh so threatening. I don't blame them for being scared. 
True and right you are, but it is the manner in which the Ostrichist confronts it. Namely, by not confronting it at all. They do not wish to take serious threats seriously. It is too much to contemplate, or impossible to imagine. Therefore they decide it cannot exist. Their head is six foot under.
Hence, we define Ostrichism as denial in the face of danger. If I don't see it then it will go away! So dangerous is this denial that not even ostriches are dumb enough to do this. They were just eating underground pebbles, which is perfectly sensible behavior if you're an ostrich. It was unobservant naturalists who gave them the bad name. Those damned rapscallions.
Sadly, Ostrichism is alive and well in the field of mental health. Their self-deception runs so deep that they truly believe that suicidal people can never be serious. Even suicide attempts are not enough to convince the Ostrichist. They'll take the failure as evidence that they were right. To them this whole self destruction gambit must be mere attention seeking.
Example
Ostrichist dealing with a suicidal person:
(Response to being confided in by a suicidal person)
"What are you on about? No one really wants to ever do that. You've never even tried it have you? I mean come on, you've not so much as raided the medicine cabinet. You can't be serious!"
(Sometime later in hospital pumping the person's stomach)
"What did you use paracetamol for? Any idiot knows that won't work. I mean come on, we've got knives in the kitchen, why didn't you just slit your wrists? You only done that to get attention didn't you? It's a cry for help. Well you've got my attention now. It's a good thing you weren't serious about it!"
(A few weeks later in the doctor's office having the person's wrists bandaged)
"What did you slit your wrist's for? Everyone knows it doesn't work like that. Are you an idiot? That isn't enough. You'd have to do something major to do any real damage. You've got our attention, what do you keep doing this for? I'm getting right tired of your nonsense. You won't be getting any more help from me now."
 (At the person's funeral a few weeks later)
"Strange one they were. I never understood it. Do you think something might have been wrong with them?"
Advice for Patients
Don't worry. We know you have a very real problem. We can help you. You are pathologically  ignorant, but it is deliberate ignorance. To cure your condition we need to extract your misconceptions and then you need to deal with your denial. This may hurt a little, but it's going to be okay.
Is suicide ever a cry for help? Maybe. It's plausible someone could use it as a threat or plea for attention. Does this mean suicide is always a cry for help? Hell no. Serious mental illnesses have dreadfully high suicide rates. Attention seeking or not, a lot of them are very serious indeed.
Suicide attempts are not a trivial matter either. Killing yourself is as instinctively unnatural as drinking your own urine. You have to get pushed very hard to overcome this barrier. 
If someone attempted suicide then they meant business. Their incompetence is another issue. If they attempt again despite getting all the attention they could ever want then how can this be a mere cry for help? They are running away from a living nightmare the only way they know how. Badly!
Why then do we plunge our heads underground? Perhaps it is just too huge to take in. Thinking about it is so painful that we simply decide not to. We think we will be immune whatever it is. 
Alternatively, perhaps it's too outlandish too consider. You've never felt that way. It seems so abhorrent. Surely no one could ever do it, could they? 
Sadly it's not that unusual. Roughly one in a hundred people in the general population will die by suicide. In schizophrenia this jumps to one in ten, in depression it's about one in seven, and in bipolar it's around one in five. For the severely mentally ill suicide is a very real threat. It's bigger than cancer. Please pull your head out of the sand.

Extrapolative Scholastic Seizures
Description
In every conversation you ever have somebody will suffer a brief extrapolative scholastic seizure. Normally they'll go unnoticed. However, if you are an expert and pay attention then you'll be able to detect the subtle signs. If someone starts a sentence with "In my experience..." then you will know that an extrapolative scholastic seizure is imminent.
We have all been there. The discussion shifts to a topic we know nothing about. Just when we thought we'd been wowing everyone with our depth of insight we discover were as dumb as brick. What do we do? We can't stay silent, but we don't know what to say. All would seem lost. Evolution, however, has gifted us a solution: the extrapolative scholastic seizure.
Eventually the tension will grow so great that an internal lightning storm will erupt in our brain. Suddenly, we will discover that we actually have a PhD and twenty years experience on the topic. We weren't ignorant at all. We rejoin the conversation and our embarrassment vanishes in a flash of face-saving cognitive illusion. Thank heavens for the extrapolative scholastic seizure!
Unfortunately, the mentally ill person tends to be on the receiving end. The fact that no one ever knows anything about their condition means that they trigger seizures in everyone. Usually this happens at about a rate of two per minute. In a typical case they'll find themselves getting re-diagnosed with back ache, and prescribed with ten Tae Bo classes, six past life regression sessions, and five gallons of unsweetened spirulina juice.
How does the seizure generate all this advice? The patient is an ignorant fool. They don't actually have a PhD on what they are talking about. Evolution once again has furnished us with a cunning solution.
The patient will have lots of information on unrelated topics. By drawing on this they can create the appearance of expertise. Typically this involves making wild extrapolations from the lives of their friends, family, and comic book heroes.
The exact ludicrous nonsense they end up spouting is ultimately irrelevant. The seizure must only serve to conceal their ignorance. As long as they say something they'll be okay. This works extremely well ninety percent of the time because in most conversations no one knows what they are talking about. Hence why the seizures are seldom noticed.
Obviously one should never act on what they say. Their assessments of health issues can be extremely dangerous. They've been known to misdiagnose cancer as cold sores, gall stones as liver failure, and blindness as a case of the old "eyes-too-small" problem. If in doubt seek professional advice.
Example
Patient:
"According to Marvel et al. (1998) all crazy people are hell bent on world domination, shoot lightning bolts out of their eyes, and always wear spandex. You clearly don't fit the diagnostic criteria. Obviously we need to treat you with gamma ray laser beams not Prozac." 
Mentally ill person's response:
"That's very interesting. I just finished reading a new meta-analysis on functional promoter region polymorphisms correlated with psychopathological neurobehavioral developmental outcomes. However, it doesn't mention  spandex at all. Is this a new line of research?" 
OR
"Gamma rays you say? Can't hurt. Maybe they'll enhance the whale music, positive thinking, Peruvian monkey bean juice, tantric healing crystals and my daily fifteen kilograms of multivitamins."
Advice for Patients (which means pretty much everyone) 
The seizures can easily be controlled by simply learning the skill of shutting up when you don't know what you're on about. It's that easy. If you don't want to lose face then many options are open to you. Ask the other person to explain their views. It'll make them feel great and they'll love you for it. Failing that, try learning about a broad range of topics. The seizures will become unnecessary. You'll still be an irritating know it all, but at least you will actually know something.

Terminological Hyperplasic Asphyxiation
Description
Beware! Throwing technical terms around as if you knew what they meant can cause inflammation. The hypertrophic dilatation of nomenclature will mutagenesis them to suffer apoptosis by meaninglessness. Non-interruption of these asininities will subjugate the terminology into a hyperplasic calcified conglomeration which will erelong pullulate from every orifice.
After an unspecified translation through the four dimensional space-time fabric your foot phalanges will gravitationally disassociate onto the floor. I'm not too sure why, but they will. Then you'll asphyxiate, possibly on your senesced pedal digits. Oh the moribundity!
I cognize that the aforementioned didn't fabricate much signification, but that's the ultimacy. If one utilizes symbolic morpheme combinations willy-nilly without the savvy-vous to go with them then you're just cerebellumly ill-provisioned. So please don't.    
Advice for Patients
If you don't actually know what a word means then don't use it. The weather can't be bipolar, you can't dress schizophrenic, and liking cleanliness is not OCD. If you talk like this then you don't know what you're on about.
Jokes and hyperbole have their place, but for crying out loud at least know what the words actually mean first. Otherwise you just look like an ass. Worse, all the other ignoramuses out there will copy you and soon no one will have a clue what these words mean. And your toes will drop off.
Please read a dictionary.

Poetic Phasosis
Description
The poetic phasosist looks at the ebb and flow of life and concludes that life is like an anthology of beautiful haikus. Each one is full of richness and color. Like the lyrical flow of the seasons, so to do the seasons of life shift like poems. There is the springtime of childish laughter. Then the summer breeze caresses us like a lovers hands. Soon the fading sun pierces through a red stained autumn leaf. Then comes the gentle whisper of falling snow. We close the door, light the fire, and watch the smoke rise to heaven.
We grow and change like flowers sprouting after a desert rainstorm. All things come and go like ephemeral blooms. The sun shines, the flowers wilt, and the desert awaits the next passing cloud. Life's comings and goings are like poems to the poetic phasosist. They see the flux of life and are convinced that life is a anthology of poems. 
The poetic phasosist is also a f*@king fool. I mean seriously touched in the head. Massively, majorly, brain manglingly, steel-pipe-through-the-skull, touched in the head.
Life isn't a series of disconnected haikus with each one over in twenty seconds or less. I am not going to grow out of, snap out of, pass through, get over, move past, or forget about everything in my life that quick. I'm not going through a phase. Phases don't start in childhood and last the rest of your life. If I was going to grow out of it I think I would have done so by now.
Right. Now that I've got that out of my system why exactly is the poetic phasosist deluded? If life is a collection of poems then everything is a passing phase. The book of life has no plot, nor even a main character. Life is a collection of snippets that just happen for no real reason and to no one in particular. 
Therefore, whenever you face a crisis the poetic phasosist will recommend you turn the page. Each crisis we face will be gone when the poem ends. Our situation, family, and our very selves can all be left behind by a simple flick of the wrist. After all, it's just a phase.
I don't deny that we all want to turn over a new leaf from time to time. Indeed, poetic phasosis may seem a romantic view of life to some, but this is not so. Like all unrealities it leads to disappointment. Poetic phasosis is a disease.
Life is not a compilation of three line poems. If it is a poem then it is an epic like the Iliad, the Odyssey, or Beowulf - it's really long, confusing, a bit repetitive, badly translated, and occasionally very boring. Life is a story not a haiku. It is a drama, a thriller, a tragedy, an adventure, or failing that, a comedy. I'm seriously beginning to suspect that it is actually a comedy.
The story is written in the first person. It has only one main character - you. This troubled soul has a past that weighs heavy upon them, and a future they must confront. Painful conflicts animate their journey. Noble strengths and terrible weaknesses drive them onwards. Lovers and enemies fill the pages. They battle the odd sea monster, and they look good in sandals and a short skirt.
All theses scenes come and go, but a unity runs through them all. Conflicts must be resolved. They can last from page one all the way to page one thousand. Then they crop up again in the sequel, which no one liked very much and was a wee bit of an unplanned accident. 
The poetic phasosist ignores the reality of our lives. Mesmerized by the transient they render life nothing but chaos and noise. If life is naught but phases then life is naught but confusion. Ultimately poetic phasosis leaves the world ephemeral and unreal.
In particular, the gravity of mental illness escapes their haiku-mind. They can cast their gaze upon even the most protracted condition and consider it to be transient and fleeting. They see it as just an odd passage that will disappear in the next poem. 
The fundamental cause of poetic phasosis is a mystery to me. Too much meditation, too much poetry, or too much amnesia might explain it. Few people develop it to its fullest extent. Usually it only ever shows up when they are dealing with someone much younger than themselves.
The parents of mentally ill teenagers are rather more susceptible than most. When their child's condition first emerges they stare on blankly even as life disintegrates before their very eyes. The unfolding destruction of their child doesn't strike them as unusual at first. They were expecting change. 
So far the child's life has been filled with a series of passing phases. In hope, the distraught parents counsel the emerging adult by saying, "It's just a phase, you'll grow out of it." Of course this never ends up happening and their condition only deteriorates for being ignored.
Advice for Patients
The story of life is filled with many passing moments. Great sadness, anguish and pain all pass. Disasters, grief, and existential crises all come and go. Life changes as we grow. Even the symptoms of mental illness wax and wane. All of this is true, but many things also last with us a lifetime. 
The art lies in telling which is which. Poetic phasosis will rob you of this ability. Even so, with training and education you can learn to tell the serious from the fleeting.
Mental illness usually falls on the side of the long lasting. It can remit never to return. It can be controlled and never be a problem again. However, for many it starts young and returns again and again. It is a dominant theme of their personal saga.
Reading the life of a child is a difficult task. We expect children to be as changeable as the weather. Parents live in terror of the teenage years when all hell will break loose. Against this background it can be hard to tell what is a passing thing and what is a deeper conflict. 
The distinction is not easy, but it is essential. True mental illness certainly isn't something we all go through when we're kids. The devastation goes well beyond the normal teenage carnage, and it won't clear up in the morning. It is no passing acne of the soul.

Maladjusted Jealousy
Description
The person suffering from MJ is in the peculiar position of being envious of things that they wouldn't want if they had them. They desire a pet tiger in their bathroom, they crave to be a Rock Star with endless access to drugs and groupies, and they really wish that they had a severe mental illness so that they could live off a benefit for the rest of their life. 
Being an ignorance disorder, MJ results from not knowing jack all about what it is really like to have the desired object. The man with the tiger is too afraid to go to the toilet, the rock star is so drug addled he thinks he lives on Jupiter (not to mention all the "bonuses" he's contracted from the loose ladies), and the sickness beneficiary sure isn't enjoying their disreputable "holiday" from society. The MJer of course doesn't know any of this.
Just because the sick person isn't in a wheel chair with twenty beeping machines dangling off of them, the MJer thinks that they must actually be feeling fine. They imagine that while everyone else is at work all the beneficiaries jump on their jewel encrusted tigers, ride off to the mansions of the mega-rich, and sip martinis with the glitterati of welfare-dom. The MJer feels awfully left out.
Consequently, whenever they meet a sickness beneficiary they'll spend the entire time clicking their fingers at them. Somehow they've convinced themselves that doing this will make the sick  person leap up, drop the charade, and say, "Ha, you got me! I was bluffing the whole time. Come on, I've got a spare tiger with your name on it." 
When coupled with rightwing political leanings the MJers jealousy will be expressed as hostility rather than admiration. The conservative MJer longs to neither work nor to pay taxes, but they also wish to appear to be a pillar of society. If they see someone who doesn't work and receives tax money then their jealousy and upstandingness will drive them bonkers. They'll froth at the mouth and begin yelling pious insults. Strangely, those who are wealthy enough to avoid work and dodge most of their taxes tend to spout the most sanctimonious bullshit of all.
Example
Maladjusted jealousy sufferer:
"Wow, that's so cool. I wish I could sleep and eat all day. It must be awesome. How did you get it again? 
A brain tumor, you say? Hmmm.... I wonder how hard it would be to grow my own one? It'd be worth it though wouldn't it, what do you reckon?"
OR
"Get off your ass and get a job you lazy $&*% $##%er. Quit making excuses and just be normal like everyone else. I'm sick of paying for scumbags like you."
Mentally ill person's response:
"Oh yeah, do you think this what I went to medical school for? Do you think my dream in life was to watch TV all day? Do you think I roll around in cash in my unheated moldy rented cardboard box? I just love suffering, I love not being able to think straight, I love all the damage this has done to my life. That must be why I do this." (Followed by a long string of un-publishable abuse and flying crockery.)
Treatments to be inflicted on the patient
To cure this condition the following regimen is advised. Tie the patient to a sofa and leave them there with no job, no friends, and nothing to do for a month or two. Hurl abuse at them occasionally so that they feel guilty for being tied to the sofa. If they aren't incredibly miserable and bored by this then shift them onto the following drugs (release them from the sofa if you wish, but it won't make much difference by the time you're done with them).
For the first week put large doses of ecstasy in their breakfast cereal without them knowing. Slip in a few caffeine tablets for good measure. The patient will buzz and trip like never before. Hopefully their bizarre behavior will cost them all their friends and lose them their job.
The next week withdraw the previous drug and replace it with sleeping pills. The after effects of the last week will still be screwing with them. The sedatives will give them a massive bonus kick in the downwards direction. 
In addition, every time they appear on the cusp of falling asleep slap them hard and scream insults at them. Don't let them sleep. We want the sedatives to make them feel exhausted, not to let them rest. They should be pretty miserable within a day or two. After one week of sedatives shift them back onto the stimulants. If you haven't destroyed their life after two weeks you will have after three. 
Repeat the cycle for the rest of their life, or until they shut up about "playing sick." Be careful. If this doesn't kill them then chances are they'll be so traumatized by a taste of life as a manic-depressive that they'll never be able to work again.

Chapter 6: Relationship Specific Disorders
Some disorders occur only in the context of relationships (oh okay, I could only think of two, but two still counts as "some" doesn't it). Anyway, most treatments will require the co-operation of both partners. I'm really sorry about this. I know it isn't why got together to begin with. You'll just have to give it a shot.

The Piss Off and Hug Me Relational Death Vortex
Description
Some people have the misfortune of getting involved with hate filled ignorant tools. However, if you're beginning to think that your partner is one of them then you need to make sure that you aren't actually stuck in a Relational Death Vortex. Their abusive behavior may well be fueled by deep insecurities.
The cause of the Vortex is the existence of high rejection sensitivity in one or both partners. Technically, this isn't a Stigma Disorder at all. Rejection sensitivity can in fact be a symptom of mental illness. Nevertheless, when you're whirling down the plughole of the Vortex there will be a lot of crap flying your way. If you have a mental illness then this trash will be carrying all the usual baggage.
High rejection sensitivity means pretty much what it sounds like. For whatever reason the person who is like this is hypersensitive to being tossed aside by others. They are so thin-skinned that they are constantly expecting to get rejected. They'll pick out slights, criticisms, and lovelessness even if it isn't there. Then they will react very badly.
As little as a mistimed cough will automatically trigger their defenses. The fight-or-flight mechanism will kick in and an emotional lightning storm plus three days of the cold shoulder will ensue. All they truly want is to be hugged. Instead, this desire gets so mangled by their neurotic mental machinery that it comes out as "Piss off you bastard!"
Unfortunately, the mentally ill are much more likely to get sucked into the Vortex than other people. Not only can they suffer from high rejection sensitivity, but they are hell on earth to anyone else who does. The mental person's own condition will make it hard for them to be the nicest person to say the least. When faced with them the sensitive person will have a breakdown. They'll get so nasty that the mentally ill person will also have a massive breakdown. The sensitive person will of course go on to perceive this as a sign of rejection.
Therefore, when the mentally ill and the extremely sensitive meet, the two tormented individuals can begin to orbit each other like radioactive neutron stars being sucked into a black hole. The overwhelming cosmic forces will rip their tortured minds to shreds and send the debris plunging downwards into the shared annihilation of the Relational Death Vortex. Unless they can sit down and talk about it. In other words, oblivion is inevitable, and the relationship will be shattered into a million swirling shards of bitterness and lost love.
Example
Sensitive person:
"You're not a very nice person. You're so selfish, you never care about me! Ah! You dick, I hate you!"
Mentally ill person's reaction:
 "Enough already! Just leave me alone. I can't take it anymore. Arghhh! I hate you too!"
Mentally ill person's actual thoughts:
WTF?! Thanks for the commentary. I didn't do anything you crazy #$%$! What the hell is going on here?
OR
I guess I'm just not very nice after all. Oh nooooo! I'm so horrible! Why am I so horrible? Something must be wrong with me. Oh wait that's right...Oh noooo! I feel terrible. I'm so messed up. Ahhh! I am a horrible person.
OR
Oh my God no! I'm going to be abandoned because everybody hates me. What a ghastly thought. What if they do? Oh no, they're going to aren't they? Nobody loves me. I'll never have a friend in the world. I'll be imprisoned! The world's going to end! What did that cough mean?
Advice for those spinning towards certain doom 
The key for both parties trapped in the deadly dance is to learn to see the other as they actually are. The sensitive one needs to realize that the other person is in hell and their actions aren't always to be taken personally. The frazzled mentally ill person requires x-ray goggles so that they can see that their partner is acting out of fear.
Mutual overreactions aside, both partners will end up getting pretty nasty. It's going to take some hard work to pull each other back out of the vortex. This will be hard. I repeat, this will be bloody hard. Communication and compassion are your only hope. Things can get better. I urge you, pull out of the vortex before it's too late!

Conflict Induced Innocence: Reactive Sainthood and Reactive Laplacian Demonhood
Description
These two forms of Conflict Induced Innocence frequently occur when one partner has an obvious imperfection and the other one does not. The underlying motivation for both sides is the desire to dodge a bullet and appear innocent. Which form they adopt will depend on who has the obvious problem.
Reactive Sainthood occurs in the person who thinks everything is okay with them. As soon as they discover that their partner is "crazy" they will instantly transform (in their head) into a flawless angel descended from heaven. The truth of the matter is that they too have temporarily lost their mind.
All the troubles in the relationship will instantly become the fault of the "sick" one. If they get angry with the Saint then it's not because the Saint is an insensitive cow. No, no, no! That's just the "crazies" speaking. Their opinions no longer matter. Simply asking "Have you taken your medication?" is all it takes to discredit them completely.
With the option of Sainthood closed to them by their illness the "crazy" person will be forced to become a Laplacian Demon. For the non-philosophers among us, Laplace's Demon is a hypothetical entity which, supposedly, would be able to know everything that has ever happened and ever will happen simply by knowing the location and movement of every atom in the universe. Pretty cool huh?
And what the fudge-monkeys has this got to do with anything? Apart from breathing fire, brandishing a pitch fork, and speaking with a sexy French accent, the Demon is most well known for its reasoning - deterministic reasoning to be precise. That means that it believes we have no free will (yes I know this means it's an Incompatibilist as well as a Determinist, smarty pants, but come on what is this? A philosophy paper?).
Anyways, why would we want to become a philosophical French fiend? Who wouldn't? Saying that all you've ever done was the result of impersonal laws over which you have no control is just as good as being a Saint. You're off the hook. At least it works for the sake of scoring points in an argument. Don't push it though, or they'll lock you up. Not that they can control that.
Example
Reactive Saint:
"You're a monster! You've ruined our relationship! I would never have had to sleep with your brother if it wasn't for you. It's all your fault. I'm perfect you measly diseased person. PERFECT!" 
Reactive Laplacian Demon:
"Can't you see my dear, I have no control over any of that. Due to the alignment of Sagittarius in the quadrant of Prozac, the quantum entanglement of my right medial hypothalamic temporal cortex with the spin state of a spoon, and the dark matter flux through my feet, it was always inevitable that I would be a complete asshole as well as depressed. You can't blame me for it. I had no choice." 
Advice for Saints and Demons
Oh come on you guys! You are both dodging responsibility here. Remember folks, your relationship was going to have troubles anyway. They weren't all going to be one persons fault.
The "healthy" partner can't suddenly blame everything on the "ill" one. Trust me darling, you aint that healthy yourself. Unless you just happen to be a real saint (in which case you must be crazy, as all saints are).
Now, now, you sicko. Have you lost all control? Are you completely cut off from reality and flailing around the room like an escaped washing machine inhabited by gremlins? Maybe sometimes, but not all the time. You can't blame everything on your illness, your quite capable of being a jackass under your own steam. If you can control only one thing then you are still responsible for that one thing.
I recommend large doses of sedatives for both parties. Not for any particular reason, mind you. I just can't get to sleep with all your yelling.

Chapter 7: Jerk disorders
What more can I say? The title sums it all up really doesn't it? That's right, these guys are diagnosable jerks. A multitude of conditions exist. All of them create people that you just don't want to be around. Treatment is difficult, but still possible. As always, don't lose hope.

Involuntary Comedic Tic Disease
Description
Children skip merrily through a playful world of rhymes and silly games. For them the sun shines brightly, the birds sing sweetly, and the bees buzz busily. They laugh at the smallest of things. Funny faces, Mummy's hugs, and loud farts fill their giggly hearts with delight. Life is a game to them, rich in humour and enjoyment. It seems like the fun could last forever. Thankfully, parental discipline will normally beat such nonsense out of the child by age twelve.
However, in ICTD the forced parental repression leads to an explosive build up of comedy. Eventually the pressure becomes so great that they can no longer keep a lid on all this childish trash of theirs. At any hour of day, or night, including during sleep, the sufferer will uncontrollably bark out humorous comments on anything, everything, and nothing. This disease is most sickening to all of us who live in the adult world.
A progressive melting of the frontal lobes, which removes all self-restraint, is the primary cause of the breakdown. In fact, the ICTD brain has been discovered to be sixty nine percent wax and eight percent animal crackers. The melting process sets in when they are first exposed to sunlight, or strong liquor, whichever comes first. Eventually, all their higher thought processes will be lost leading them to become a stand-up comedian, or humour writer. It is a terrible fate for any parent to see.
Sadly, many cases progress to what is known as the Dark Side. In this rabidly malignant form only the offensive, highly taboo, and incredibly bad taste will be capable of titillating their laughter neurons. The comedic equivalent of porn fatigue is believed to be the main precipitating factor. The constant self stimulation provided by their tic ends up with them needing bigger and more extreme hits just to laugh normally.  
The newly malevolent ICTDer will spasmodically spurt insults whenever minorities are in sight. They'll mock cripples, laugh at the death of children, and make way too many jokes about poo. Every derogatory term, stereotypical slander, and swear word known to mankind will be quickly learnt and repeated whenever it's most indecent to do so.
After several beatings and a failed stand-up routine, these bigoted lunatics tend to get cut off from society. Their final few days will be spent in a trashcan laughing hysterically at whichever of their toes is darkest. Irritated rats will then gnaw them to death.
Don't be fooled! The early stages of malignant ICTD can be hard to spot. Some manage to control the tic long enough to be functional members of a workplace for decades. They might even hold out to write a few episodes for your favourite TV show. Nevertheless, in all cases of malignant ICTD the descent to trashcan phase is inevitable.
Sadly, the mentally ill are often the target of the rabid ICTDer. Due to the wealth of derogatory stereotypes, the abundance of colourful "crazy person" language, and the taboo nature of mocking the disabled, the malignant ICTDer could spend their whole life laughing at no one else. Not only that, they'd enjoy doing so too. 
Even so, it is best not to get too angry with them. Telling them to shut up typically fails. They don't know how. I suggest you buy them a trashcan instead.
Example
Sufferer of malignant ICTD:
"Ha! Look at her. Ha! She's a moody Sheila. Ha! Hello bipolar! Ha! Look out. Crazy. Ha! There's a pill for that. Ha! A chill pill! Ha! Like two different people. Ha! Schitzo anyone? Ha! I can't stop! Ha! I must be OCD! Ha! Oh no! Ha! Guess what? Ha! F*@king Asian drivers! Ha! Seriously I can't stop. Ha! Retard! Ha! Duh! Ha! Gay! Ha! Help me. Ha! Toes!" (Then eaten by rats.)
Mentally ill person's reaction:
"Heh... heh... hmm...." (Backs away slowly clenching and unclenching fists.)
Mentally ill person's actual thoughts:
Ignore it? Complain? Pass on by? Punch the bastard? Would shooting them be an overreaction? Choices, choices....
OR
Oh, they didn't mean that, did they? Seriously, did they actually mean that? Is something wrong with me? Did I really just hear that? Can't have. Did I? No, did they say that? Maybe I should get my ears checked. No one would say that, surely. You'd have to have something wrong with you to say that. 
Advice for patients and those unfortunate enough to be near them 
The nonmalignant form is a heartbreaking, but mostly harmless affair. Apart from regular checkups in case of anomalies they should be left in a small dark room where they won't disturb anyone. The cultural carnage of the malignant ICTDer is what really needs addressing.
Chronic joking without knowing what you're on about only serves to trivialize things through over use. Only so many things can be called Schitzo before schizophrenia loses all meaning. It doesn't have anything to do with having a split personality by the way. If you use that as a joke you're an idiot. Unfortunately, it is exactly this kind of crap that the malignant ICTDer loves most. 
Ignorance can lead people to conclude that the gibbering fool is actually funny. Mimics then spread their filthy memes to the unwashed masses. The world becomes an echo chamber for their stereotypes and bigotries. Our schools, churches, and workplaces are left riddled with bullshit that should only elicit laughter from demented shrews, and people who buy into the prejudices of demented shrews of course. I seriously hope you're not one of them you drooling, barking, schitzo freak.
Maybe you disagree with me. Isn't the ICTDers slathering insult routine just par for the course? Stand-up comedians do this all the time don't they? It's all just fun and games. You think that I'm just OVERREACTING! Can't I just calm down and take a joke? Gosh. What a high strung wacko! Get a grip already. Hello!
Just because something doesn't offended you doesn't mean it isn't loathsome. Think of any characteristic about you which is shameful. Maybe you're fatter than a pickup truck, a high school dropout with an IQ of two, or a secret compulsive masturbator with a taste for animal porn. Then look for crude jokes on that topic. How do you feel? Imagine that this attribute was a central feature of your life. Imagine that you've suffered a great deal from this. Imagine you've suffered discrimination because of this. Feeling sensitive? If this doesn't affect you then I'm afraid you may have a case of malignant ICTD.
Now, I'm no fan of political correctness, but I don't much like ignorant hate filled assholes either. Sure, taboos are fair game for comedy. However, there is a big difference between taboo breaking and being an abusive bigot. We don't need the bigotry.  Its only funny to other abusive bigots anyway.
If you have malignant ICTD then what can we do? The treatment will depend on how much vestigial compassion you have left. If you still have enough to considered human then the following treatment is recommended. I know you don't want to do this, but it's for the greater good.
Make a list of all the things that make you laugh. This will tell which minorities you hate best, understand least, and fear most. Next, pick the first one on the list and go find a member of this group. Then attempt to make friends with them. 
If they don't beat you to death in the first day then you'll discover just how much of an ignorant asshole you are. Soon you won't find jokes about this group funny at all. Go through your entire list and do this. Eventually you'll have eliminated all your prejudices. You'll still have malignant ICTD, you just won't have anyone left to laugh at.
For more severe cases classical conditioning will be needed. Normally we'd only ever do this to circus animals and lab rats, but you're getting close so we'll make an exception. I warn you, this won't be pleasant.
First, you are to find the most easily offended little old lady on the planet. Give her complete control over your ability to spend money. If she doesn't like you then you will soon starve to death. 
Next, lock an electrified collar on your neck. Make sure it contains a microphone that is wirelessly linked to an earpiece. Give the keys, buzz controller, and ear piece to the little old lady. Every time she doesn't like what she hears a hundred thousand volts will zap up your spinal cord and send sparks flying out of your eyeballs. After several years of blinding pain you'll be successfully rehabilitated.
(Warning: side effects include developing a taste for nicely folded linen, a habit of going to bed at 6pm, and repetitive strain injury from excessive jar opening. Death is also possible, but we're willing to risk it.)

Moronic Comedic Tic Disease
Description
The origins of this condition are believed to be the same as for Involuntary Comedic Tic Disease. The moronic form occurs when ninety nine percent of the brain is made from a slurry of cheese and lint. On seeing anything that they don't understand, or looks out of place, or looks in place for that matter, the patient will point and squeal like pig. This gets annoying very quickly.
It's usually more of a danger to themselves than anyone else. They lack the ability to stop when it isn't funny, or to know what is and isn't funny for that matter. Five to ten hour stretches repeating the same one line joke are not unheard of. 
In such cases the best way to break them out of it is to draw their attention to their belly button. They'll have forgotten what it is. Consequently, seeing it will make them squeal like a pig.
Example
Patient:
"Ha your funny. Heh heh, yeah....Ha your funny. Heh heh, yeah....Ha your funny. Heh heh, yeah...." (ad infinitum) 
Advice for dealing with patients
Muzzling them is unethical. Exile, however, is highly recommended. Send them to a farm far, far away. There they can live out their days in peace squealing with the pigs.

Theoculpamania
Description
Theoculpamania (THEO- meaning God, CULPA meaning guilt, -MANIA  meaning extreme enthusiasm) is a disease of the religious mind that leads the patient to cruelly inflict guilt on anyone who is suffering. Debate rages over its causes. The two leading schools see it as either being a form of sadism or a case of psychosis. 
In a typical presentation the patient gives the impression of being motivated by compassion. They then offer advice pointing the sufferer towards supposed relief. In most cases the advice will take the form of pithy phrases backed up by out of context Bible verses. 
In all cases the advice will actually be a roundabout way of blaming the sufferer for their trouble. Tied onto this is an appeal to religious authority so that it can't be ignored. "God said you should burn in hell you evil bastard!" is the guts of the theoculpamaniac's message.
The layman might think the maniacs are merely confused. "This is an ignorance disorder, surely!" they say. Don't be fooled. Oh no! These people are devil spawn through and through. It is all the worse because they don't know it.
Example
Theoculpamaniac:
"You need to pray and have more faith in God." 
OR
"Unclean! Unclean! Repent ye evil accursed one! Perhaps He shall yet forgive ye of ye crimes, and remove this plague from your cup."
OR
"Get behind me Satan! Leave now evil spirit of sickness! Wallawumbe shuddanda tiki unda...." 
Suffering person's response:
"Praise the Lord, yep, praising the Lord. Uh huh, praising... what? Oh yeah, I'm with you.  I'm praising... totally praising...."
Suffering person's actual thoughts:
How many times do I have to pray, read the Bible, be exorcised, and swim in holy water for God to heal me? My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
What am I doing wrong? I must be too sinful. God does not want me. It's my own fault I'm here. Where is God anyway? He has abandoned me to my fate. He does not love us or answer our prayers. He must be evil! I think I might become an atheist if this keeps up.
OR
Alright then, let's cut a deal shall we? Fifty percent of my Sundays for the next twenty years in return for one complete healing. Do we have an agreement? Okay, make it sixty for twenty. Fine, eighty for ten, final offer. Seventy for thirty? One hundred for five? Five for a hundred? Come on just heal me already! I'll do anything!
OR
Here we go again. Lord forgive them for they know not what they are doing. Oh, and while you're at it, maybe just a little smiting. A wee bit maybe, for old time's sake? Go on. Please.
Advice for Patients 
Read the book of Job. I'll let God tell you what his opinion of this attitude is. Although, I may have to perform an exorcism on you too. Theoculpamania can be brought on by an inability to resist a certain evil spirit, namely your own spirit.

Petrifaction of the Brain
Description
Do you sufferer from brain petrifaction? This quick test will let you know. Give one point for each of the following statements that describes you.
1) You like to sit on your porch with a shotgun yelling at children to "Get off a my lawn!"
2) While on your porch you can't help but stare whenever a black, Asian, Hispanic, Indian,  pacific island, Jewish, Arab, or white person walks past.
3) You still live where you were born, have the same friends as when you were two, and haven't bought any new clothes in the last twenty years.
4) You aint gonna be caught eating none of that gosh darned foreign muck.
5) You agree with any of the following: a woman's place is in the kitchen, children should be seen not heard, Hippies should be shot, abolishing slavery was a mistake, and homosexuals are an abomination.
6) Those cursed [insert chosen group here] ought to keep their opinions to themselves. You and your folks are only believing what's common sense.
7) You think all of the above is slagging off those stupid conservative types, and that you have no close-minded prejudices of your own.
If you scored zero or more on this test then I'm afraid we may need to bring you in for further testing. Petrifaction of the brain is a very serious problem. It leaves the sufferer incapable of tolerating variety of any kind. Anyone not conforming to an arbitrary set of standards will be shunned, ridiculed, and lynched.
Petrifaction afflicts people who see themselves as part of a majority, regardless of what that majority thinks. Conservatives, liberals, and even stamp collecting clubs can all fall prey to this deadly disease. Their brain will seize up, their attitudes will calcify, and their moral sphere will shrink to the size of a toadstool. Ultimately they will become a close-minded prejudiced jerk.
The mentally ill are a minority. Therefore everyone else is susceptible to petrifaction when it comes to mental health. They don't want to hear about us, see us, or tolerate us. They sure don't want us in their neighborhood.
This is a serious problem for those of us who are mentally ill. Even so, there is cause for hope. Some of us are working to change this. We've put in place some major drives to reverse this phenomena. This book is a part of that effort. So far we've been exceeding our targets. It really is an exciting time. I anticipate that in the next few years this problem could be gone. That's right, soon we'll be the majority. Hallelujah!
Several competing theories exist to explain this phenomenon. The Sub-lethal Memetic Infection Hypothesis states that they are carrying a persistent virus which impairs their ability to think (see below for the Terminal Memetic Infection). The Herd Instinct Hypothesis suggests that it is due to a woody overgrowth of the conform and exclude regions of the brain. The Low IQ hypothesis says that these guys are just numbskulls.
Example
Petrified: 
"Hey Schizo. You look funny and I don't like it. We don't take kindly to your sort around these parts. We only accept drag queens, gays, and abortion doctor here. Skedaddle you." 
Advice for treating petrifaction 
Intrusive surgery with a sledgehammer is not recommended. Failure rates are high. Plus you can get arrested for that. A gentle soaking and softening is more effective. Make sure to use a good disinfectant too. You never know where they've been.

Terminal Memetic Infection
Description
Similar to zombies, but worse, the victim of a Terminal Memetic Infection is utterly out of control. Unless they are handcuffed and thrown in a small padded room they risk becoming a serious danger to society. Even educated zombies know better than to go near these guys.
The infection is spread from the oral cavities of the diseased into the ear canals of the vulnerable. Individuals with a poor critical thinking system will be unable to fend off the virulent meme. It will then send tendrils through their brain and manipulate their behavior for the sole purpose of spreading itself to new victims.
The host will be left intolerant of anything that doesn't agree with the meme's objectives. They'll also carry a whole suite of bizarre baggage that tags along with the central meme. All pre-existing jerk disorders, bigotry and small-mindedness will become super powered as the meme leverages all the host's resources to its advantage. 
While it is possible that a memetic infection could cause the victim to love all of humanity, be the best they can be, and de-stigmatize mental illness, this seldom seems to happen. I suspect it all comes down to simple math. Memes which act on the lowest common denominator can infect anyone. All the others have a habit of dying out.
Evangelistic versions of dysdenial and hyperactive cases of theoculpamania are the biggest problems that I am aware of in the field of mental health. No doubt other disorders can become supercharged as well. Whenever you encounter a case that far exceeds the normal bounds of stupidity, arrogance, and violence a terminal memetic infection could be to blame.
The infected dysdeniers will religiously ensure that no one buys into the "scam" of mental illness. They'll shun members of their community who dare to use medicines, they'll do door knocking rounds delivering pamphlets to warn against the industry of death, and they'll set up front groups to lobby for the destruction of psychiatry's evil empire. None of this helps the mentally ill. Instead they get roped into either denying they have a problem at all, or they get cajoled into accepting "cures" that even a brain dead dog would be suspicious of.
 For the theoculpamaniacs, the meme will drive them to perform violent exorcisms of non-existent demons, order the unwell to throw away their medicines, and they'll even run up and down the backs of people with spinal injuries. To top it off they will declare anyone who doesn't do these things to be unspiritual. They are not just annoying, they are downright dangerous.
Advice for Patients
A course of critical thinking is highly recommended for the prevention of this disease. Take one ASAP. Fear not! Recovery via large doses of open mindedness is possible. Treatment is essential. Destructive memes need to be wiped out.

Schadenfreude Personality Disorder
Description
Schadenfreude is a German term denoting the pleasure taken in another's misfortune. In some people this attitude is the only noticeable thing about them. Like Nelson off the Simpsons, you'll only ever see them when they leap out of the bushes to mock you when you're down. No one likes them very much and they don't like you either. 
They get so carried away with their Schadenfreude that they'll find great joy in the misfortune of anyone they've ever competed with, disliked, or just seen in a park somewhere. As this is the only pleasure in their miserable lives they'll make a point of finding suffering people for the sole purpose of laughing at them. It's practically a full time occupation for many of them.
Although ultimately self destructive, their habit is a coping mechanism. The Schadenfreude enhances their self esteem. This is mainly because they have none to begin with. Ironically, the recipient of their mockery should feel honoured. Schadenfreude is a proven expression of envy. 
Advice for Patients 
Ha ha! You have low self esteem. Sucks to be you.
Sorry. I didn't mean that. You can find better ways to feel good about yourself. Okay? Go get 'em Tiger.

The Inappropriate Rocky Balboa Complex
Description
Rocky Balboa, the fictional prize-fighter who just keeps on taking the punishment, has inspired two psychiatric phenomena. The first is the harmless Rocky Balboa Obsessive Disorder where the patient is fixated on becoming like Rocky. The result is generally positive, even if it is a bit bizarre. 
The patient embraces the principle of moving forward no matter how many hits they take. Then they go out of their way to get hit pretty damn hard a lot of times. Excessive humming of Eye of the Tiger is a common feature.
In contrast, the Inappropriate Rocky Balboa Complex sufferer doesn't aspire to be like Rocky. He thinks he already is Rocky. The disease is almost exclusive to young males with gym access.
In reality, the sufferer is wholly unlike Rocky in every way. In his entire life he has never been hit by anything harder than a tennis ball. Nevertheless, he has convinced himself that he can take on the whole world. As a consequence of his delusion he ends up spouting macho crap at every opportunity. He never actually does anything though.
At first he seems to have come down with a harmless case of Transitory Tough Guy Syndrome. However, he rapidly descends into the terminal jerk-hood of full-blown IRBC. He will be rendered incapable of breaking character, ever.
His inappropriate comments at birthdays, weddings, and funerals will see him forced to only associate with other sufferers. The reinforcement he receives from them will only escalate his problem even further. Eventually he will be deemed inappropriate even at over the top pro-wrestling matches.
Unfortunately, the unobservant may mistake him for a real Rocky Balboa emulator. If they are going through hard times then they risk becoming dejected that such an obvious retard can apparently handle life better than themselves. This is made all the worse by the pseudo-Rocky's delusion that he is in fact a famous role model. This fantasy has lead to several high profile restraining orders banning sufferers of the complex from running near children.
Depressed men are a prime target for the crazed Rocky. The Rocky's ideal masculine image is one of emotionless gung-ho power. Sensitivity, depth, and tears don't fit. The deluded bogus Rocky will think he is infinitely superior to the depressed man. 
This belief is difficult to take seriously considering that the pseudo-Rocky has never been through jack all. The depressed man endures daily more than Mr. Machismo has suffered in his whole life. The depressed man will do well to remember this.
The causes of IRBC are subject to fierce debate. Some studies suggest that it is inversely proportional to penis length. These theorist posit that the macho facade is a psychic defence to compensate for this inadequacy. Not many studies have been done however. Very few of the fake Rockys can be trusted to give accurate measurements. They don't seem to understand that lies have to be physically possible to be believable. 
Example
Inappropriate Rocky Balboa:
"Life's not fair, you've just got to roll with the punches baby. It's time to be a man, or a manly woman, but not a womanly man, unless it's manly womanliness, in which case you could be a manly womanly man, or a manly womanly manly woman. You know what I mean bro. 
I don't need fancy words. School is for sissies. I studied at the school of hard knocks biatch. I'll kill you! Eye of the Tiger..."
Depressed man's response:
"Oh me, did you think I was depressed? Ha, ha, no I'm fine actually. I think I must have only... slept poorly/ been shot in the head with a staple gun/ had a BS induced convulsion..., but I'm sure not depressed. No way! Uh rah!"
Depressed man's actual thoughts:
Damn right life's not fair, else you'd be in this and I wouldn't. I'll kick your ass.
OR
Woe is me. Why can't I handle life as easily as this fine young specimen before me. So wise and capable are they, yet I am but a worm in their sight. Alas alack, I am but naught, and I shall depart into the nether gloom as is befitting my weak kind. Woe is me!
Advice for Patients 
I know this is hard to grasp, but always acting like an agro roid-pumping gorilla is just wrong. You don't care for your newborn son with a strong fist. You don't want to give a literal knockout performance when you make love to a woman. You can't bludgeon sadness to death. A man has to show soft touch once and a while too. Yikes!
The manly call to toughen up and keep on going is valuable, but one day you're going to learn that some punches send you to the floor. Unless you've taken those hits yourself then you don't have the right to speak. You are treating something that would turn you into a small yellow puddle as if it were a walk in the park. Well welcome to my park. It's filled with chainsaw wielding zombies! Try taking a walk here buddy. They'll kick your ass.
Still think real men don't get depressed? Then you've never met any real men. How do you explain the depression of Nazi-thumping Prime Minister Winston Churchill, maverick Civil War General Sherman, founding father of physics Sir Isaac Newton, genius composer Beethoven, and civil rights leader Martin Luther King jr to name but a few. Do you think they were they weak? They might not have spent all day doing bicep curls, but they all achieved a hell of a lot more than you ever will. Perhaps you need to reconsider what elements are conducive to creating "real men."

Chapter 8: Non-human Animals
I have discovered that none of the following are actually human. They look human, they even smell human, but their behaviour is far too abnormal to be explained by anything else. Being species rather than disorders the possibility of finding a "cure" is questionable. I for one refuse to give up hope, but I do caution you: do not feed them, do not touch them, and never be tempted to get one as pet. These are dangerous wild animals.

The Great White Snark
Description
The first reported sightings of this creature were made by eight drunken sailors in the nineteenth century. Those fools thought they could hunt it. Snarks have been the bane of modern civilisation ever since. By the 1950s Snarks were getting involved in the creation of malfunctioning thermonuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles. Their assumed long-term objective is the destruction of humanity. 
The most feared of all Snarks (other than the Boojum) is the Great White Snark. It has adapted to living unnoticed among humans. Many mistake them for real people. 
Don't be deceived! The Great White Snark is a cool and callous predator. You can spot one by its habit of speaking while looking down its nose at you and snarling. Look out! It will attack.
The best of them will stalk you for days. Hiding in the shadows, they will expertly uncover your psychological weak spots. With great patience they will wait until you are at your most vulnerable. 
Then, in a sudden ambush they will strike. A volley of cruel comments will be shot at you with the precision of a marksman. Subtle, yet deadly, each one will leave you reeling, but won't permit you to respond without looking like an overreacting ass. While you stagger from the blows the Great White Snark will disappear back into the deep, circling, ever circling.
The worst of them are unable to control their inner hatred of humans. They'll blather and spit abuse at you. Consequently, they spend their time repeatedly getting beaten up in nightclubs. These unfortunate failures will eventually slink back to the Snark Cave. There they will morph into vile and hideous monsters known to all as Narcissistic Internet Trolls. The sun will never shine upon their warty faces again.
Example
Expert Great White Snark:
"Oh hello my dark queen of the night! Are you crying? Oh no! And you thought you could keep it a secret. Aren't you being a tad emotional there? 
You're never interested in anything. Except for you own dramas! You're no fun my friend. All this feeling sorry for yourself, why, your being irrational. Toodle-oo my teary drama queen. Toodle-oo."
Victim's response:
"Uh." (Collapses on floor and doesn't move for the next seven weeks. Possibly dead due fatal snark attack.)
Useless Great White Snark on the verge of becoming a Troll:
"Raaar, f*@k you're mental, hiiiiss, you eat sh#t, rwaar, crazy toad face, nyak nyak nyak!"  
Victim's response:
"What did you say?" (Cracks knuckles and flexes shoulders.)
Advice for dealing with Snarks
Hunt, shoot, and serve with greens. The future of civilization depends on it. Sadly many depression sufferers develop secondary pseudo-snarkhood. It is a sad, sad outcome. Hunt, medicate, and serve with greens. The future of civilization depends on it.

Stereospongiforms
Description
The Stereospongiforms are a family of filter feeding organisms that live off the intellectual detritus found floating in the air. A damp pile of week old tabloids and gossip magazines is the best place to find them. Stereosponges, as they are commonly known, imbibe every negative stereotype and prejudice that can be found in their vicinity. As a byproduct of their feeding they regularly emit offensive clichés. 
The Lesser Reticent Stereosponge is the most common one you'll encounter. By keeping their emissions to a minimally acceptable level they can blend into normal human society. Nevertheless, they are easily spotted by their passively discriminatory actions.
Anyone who is a member of a group which is subject to bigotry will find themselves getting irritated at what the stereosponge has to say. The sponge will repeatedly comment on how it doesn't wish to date them, hire them, or come within seventeen miles of them. It might even say that it wants to lynch or burn them.
All this talk is misleading. As sponges have no central nervous system, let alone a brain, everything they say is merely "passing through" as they feed on it. They will only ever go out of their way to harm you if it is common practice to do so.
Example
The Lesser Reticent Stereosponge during feeding:
"Mmm. Brittany Spears. She's crazy. Mmm. If you're as crazy as a loon I don't want to date you. Mmm. Crazy people are dangerous. Mmm. All of them kill themselves. Mmm. I don't want them living in my neighborhood. Mmm. Delicious."
Advice for dealing with Stereosponges
One can attempt to change their diet to more wholesome fare, but it's like trying to feed rocks to a cat. The best method is to make it look trashy then throw it at them. If you're lucky they'll absorb it for a short spell. 
Don't get your hopes up. Remember, they are passive creatures. A change of mind requires a mind to change.

Sensationalist Voyeur Leeches
Description
Most leeches are hematophagous, that is they feed on blood.  Sensationalist Voyeur Leaches, however, have adapted to feed on other people's problems. They thrive on denigrating gossip and embarrassing topless photos. The more unexpected and damming it is the more they relish it. Whole industries are devoted to satisfying their hunger. 
On spotting a potential juicy tidbit the leech will invade the host's personal space, latch its toothed sucker to their forehead, and attempt to extract the gossip directly from their brain. Later it will regurgitate the meal in as public a fashion as possible. Other Voyeur Leeches will be drawn to the sick distorted mess to feed for themselves. Their delight in the contents of their comrades stomach will lead them to spend hours savouring over "what it means." 
Advice for dealing with Sensationalist Voyeur Leeches
Because it injects a natural anaesthetic when it bites, you could be oblivious to its presence for hours. Don't let that happen. It has no right to extract anything from you other than a kick in the pants. 
The leech should be removed as quickly as possible. Throw large amounts of salt at it if you have to. Never let it throw up on you. They are known to carry lethal diseases.
It is a terrible thing indeed if a leech should begin to feed on your problems. Sometimes all that can be done is to wait for it to become satiated, drop off, and squirm back in to its dark hole. Try not to get too upset. It's only a hungry worm, nothing more.

Werebigots
Description
In the same way that werewolves only emerge with the full moon, the vile prejudice of werebigots only comes out in specific circumstances. At all other times it is safely locked away. Werebigots are more common than you think. Your best friend might be one. You might be one.
The transformation can be triggered by anything from bad weather to peanuts. All it needs to do is loosen the werebigot's inhibitions. Anger and alcohol work the best.
In a flash they will sprout a small black moustache, spurt hateful rhetoric, and begin goose stepping. A few moments later they will shudder violently, howl at the moon, then scamper away on all fours. The next day they will have no memory of the event and swear it wasn't them.
Advice for dealing with werebigots
Their transient attacks never last long, although some do become trapped as permanent bigots. Even if this does happen, you needn't be worried for their welfare. People are more than willing to hire them as talkback radio show hosts. 
The general treatment procedure is to apply a severe electric shock to their buttocks whenever an attack occurs. It won't lessen the attacks mind you, but it will make them more pleasant for everyone else. We do what we can.

The Office Bully, or Papio culus
Description
New evidence has dramatically overturned the established theory that the Office Bully is within the normal bounds of jerk-hood. Primatologists have recently discovered that these individuals are in fact a new species of tailless baboon. The new name, Papio culus, (PAPIO meaning baboon, CULUS meaning anus or buttocks in reference to its lack of a tail, or so they claim) has lead some researchers to dub it the Butt Monkey.
The key reason for the change was the recognition that Office Bully's social behavior overlaps entirely with that of baboons. Their social lives are ruled by the belief that they are in a strict baboon dominance hierarchy. All their efforts are therefore a desperate attempt to install themselves as the alpha male, or alpha female (they'll take whichever they can get). Doing so, they think, will allow them to monopolize access to all mates and resources.
Anyone who gives the impression of being a soft target will be on the receiving end of their overt dominance displays. These consist largely of hatred, ridicule and poo slinging. Subordinate Butt Monkeys who feel weaker than the target will resort to sabotage and slander. They will also suck up big time to the boss. Either way, their goal is to suppress the competition and lift their status.
Human societies evolved very differently from those of baboons. Soon after the invention of the pointy stick it was discovered that anyone could now kill the bullying alpha jerk. Anyone who tried to be an overbearing alpha thus got skewered while they slept. The baboon's strategy became a literal evolutionary dead end. 
Therefore, inserting baboon behavior in among humans is dangerous. When faced with an domineering bully a baboon will begin plotting how to become the bully. In contrast, the human response is to start whittling a pointy stick. Sadly, the advance from pointy stick to semi-automatic assault rifle means some of them now decide to take out half the neighborhood for good measure.
Advice for dealing with Papio culus
Women, for your own safety, it is best not to get in a relationship with a male of this species. Their natural order is to attempt to form a harem by stealing mates from other males. Any female that then tries to leave the harem will be viciously attacked. It aint worth it baby.
That aside, the best place for these animals is the Serengeti. Relocation efforts have stalled so far due to local resistance to having such obnoxious creatures in their backyard. The nearby human communities don't like them much either.
To date, animal training techniques have failed too. If only it were possible to make them realize everyone hates them for what they do. If only....

The Survivor Frenzy
Description
Snarks, voyeur leaches, stereosponges, werebigots, and Butt Monkeys must never be allowed to all coexist in one place. Their activity as a group is so horrific that it has become the basis of all reality TV shows. The frenzy that consumes any vulnerable person who crosses their path has been likened to a cross between a stranded whale being eaten by fire ants and a decommissioned skyscraper being detonated.
My heart bleeds for any of you in this situation. I don't know what you should do. Run, call the cops, build a nuclear fallout shelter, but whatever you do you must bring the frenzy to an end before it goes too far. Otherwise you may not live to tell the tale.
The snarks and Butt Monkeys will initiate the attack. If one discovers a victim the other will join. Their aggression will usually start with low level mockery.
Next, the voyeur leeches will rush to the scene eager to gorge themselves. Stereosponges will also drift in to feed on the left over detritus. As the group grows it will attract yet more Butt Monkeys who are afraid of being left out. 
As the victim struggles to escape more snarks will move in to take advantage of their vulnerability. The victim will attempt to reach out to others for help, but the emotionally charged atmosphere will only serve to trigger all the hidden werebigots to transform. Should the victim have wandered into a werebigot colony they risk becoming completely cut off.
This inrushing dramatically increases the size of the group in a very short time period. Buoyed by its size the group will become bolder. The attacks will escalate to "pranks", slander, and low level violence. Aroused by the violence the group will spread their attacks to everyone connected to the victim.
Eventually the snarks and Butt Monkeys will move in for the kill. They will not rest until the victim is utterly destroyed. Ironically their success is their undoing.
The group, now lacking a victim, will turn in on itself in an orgy of cannibalistic self-destruction. One by one they will create a new victim and eliminate it. The sponges and leeches will be first to go. The werebigots' outbursts will buy them a little time, but they too shall fall. Ultimately only the original Snark and Butt Monkey will remain to fight to the death. All life within a fifty mile radius will be annihilated.

Chapter 9: Final Thoughts for the Contemplative
Fortunately not all of you will suffer from one of these conditions. You my dear reader most certainly don't. Of course not. How could you? You're such a saint after all.
Despite your infinite perfections these twisted individuals may have had an inordinate impact on your view of life. Many of them have weaseled into places of influence. You might be related to one, work with one, or even sleep with one. Don't let them suck you into their madness. We can help you break free. Hold on to hope.
My dear reader, the chances are high that you are reading this because you have a genuine mental health problem. I'm sorry to have to break it to you in such an impersonal way, but you could have a lot more wrong with you than you realize. Sure, you're on the receiving end of Rocky gone wrong, crazy baboons, and moronic comedians, but something far worse could be happening. You might be one of them too. 
That's right, you too might have a Stigma Disorder. This internalized stigma will drive you crazy, well crazier anyway. It will force you into denial, keep you from treatment, and make you believe stupid stereotypes about yourself. This is no way to live.
Why put up with this from yourself of all people? You'll be better off without it. Take a good hard look at the nonsense you've been repeating to yourself and kick it where it hurts (I'm not entirely sure where that is to be honest, just as long as you quit kicking yourself where it hurts). 
Others among you will have been given this book because you are suffering from one or many of these crippling maladies. Don't worry. You can be cured. We can train you well if nothing else. Deportation to Antarctica is always an option. You like penguins don't you? 
Oh, I'm sorry, I wouldn't do that. I'd go bankrupt far too quick. A lot of you are out there unfortunately. It is a sad fact that our modern societies can still be plagued so severely by these conditions. 
If you do have a Stigma Disorder then don't let it get you down. We still love you, but you do need help. You're hurting people. Talk about your condition, seek out advice, and learn about it. Knowledge is power. In time I believe you can make a full recovery.
Now this brings us to the big question. Why all the stigma anyway? Why do we even need to have this discussion? Why are you still not going to "get it" even after reading all this? In my opinion three great problems stand in our way. Two can be removed, one cannot.
The first is ignorance, which is often conjoined with lazy arrogance and hearty lashings of denial. Unless we are willing to admit we don't know, when we don't know, then we are never going to get anywhere. We can't judge what we don't understand. Being able to shut up and listen is a rare skill it seems. 
Second comes compassion. We don't know what to do with it when we've got it, and we rarely have enough to begin with. We can do some pretty dumb things despite our best intentions. To love others as yourself is not as good as loving others as they would have themselves be loved. This isn't something we find easy to do however.
A lot stands between us and compassion. We get angry and lash out. Fear keeps us blind and distant. Sometimes life is too full for anyone but us. At other times it is too empty. Even the best of us stretch our love only so far. It is easy to put down the outsider, the forgotten, and those who are different. Is this who we want to be? Are we happy with this truncation of our souls? I hope not.
Third and last, we can never inhabit another person's mind. I'll never know what it's like to be you, and you'll never know what it's like to be me. So many things simply can't be understood unless you've been there. 
No man will ever feel the pain of childbirth. Most of us, I hope, will never experience the horror of seeing a friend killed in war. The majority of the world will never ride the heights of mania, suffer the depths of depression, or see the visions of schizophrenia. We can learn as much as we like about these things, but one thing will always be missing. Humility is the only legitimate response to this eternal divide. 
In the face of all this I feel compelled to leave you with one last condition. It is unlike all the others. I'm not sure if I've ever even met anyone with it. Perhaps it is the most bizarre of them all for this reason. Nevertheless, I hereby present you with the final condition of Blackmore's Compendium of Stigma Disorders. It is the only one that deals with stigma by doing away with it.

Human Thriving Syndrome
This condition takes time. Great suffering, painful introspection, and obsessive dedication are believed to be required. Like a slowly opening flower it reveals itself in stages. To the untrained eye the progression is imperceptible, but it is happening all the same.
This condition condemns its victim. No one will understand them. Those of us without it find them laughable, soft headed, or strange. They will suffer for it, yet they know they would have suffered more without it. 
They aren't afraid of the pain. Growth can make us hurt and hurt can make us grow. They don't abandon the darkness of reality so as to clasp to fluffy false hopes. They know reality. It forces them to be humble enough to have hope.
They aren't "happy" as we normally seek to be. They go beyond mere happiness to joy, contentedness, and meaning. They have learnt to see the glory in each moment and the promise in each day. Even if they should die tomorrow they will have lived a full life.
They know that they don't know. The world is little more than a sketch to them. Each day they add a few more lines to the page hoping that one day the picture will emerge and be clear. As it is the drawing is still chaotic and dark, yet even this has its beauty.
They are themselves through and through, and that doesn't bother them. Their talents, quirks, and flaws are all theirs. They know that to love others as yourself you must first love yourself.
They are not wrapped up in themselves. They love more than they hate. They judge no one, yet they do not hold their punches. Firm yet supple they bend, but do not break. They don't repay evil for evil. Nor do they tolerate it.
Self aware, they take responsibility even when no one else does, yet they also know where their duty ends. They forgive more than they accuse. They don't cut and run on their friends. They see people as people, not as labels. They cherish and laugh at all our peculiarities and differences. They recognize that our shared humanity outweighs a world of differences. Looking at the madness we call life, they love, and they laugh.
Some people tell me that no one has this condition. They say that it's impossible, that it doesn't exist, and that it's all in my head. Maybe it is, but I hope that one day you get it.
