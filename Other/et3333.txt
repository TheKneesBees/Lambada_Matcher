The Songs of Dominance were released as an experiment. I wanted to write in Jonathan's POV, but did not know how readers would react. So I released Jessica to the people on my mailing list. The response was phenomenal, so I released the second story, Sharon, to my ever-growing list.

They were traded peer-to-peer on the Goodreads group, CD Canaries, and on my Facebook page. I'd like to thank Canaries Tony, Erik, and Donna for their generosity of spirit in sending out the email repeatedly.

But the stories have become canonical, and things are revealed here that will be come important later, so I feel they need to reach a larger audience.

Please read these after Submit, or you're going to run into major spoilers. It's best if you read before Control, but not a big deal if you read Control first.

JESSICA

(This begins after the Eclipse show, when Jonathan drives away from Monica's house)

***

I watched Monica close the door behind her and felt the car dive off that cliff of a hill. Her house would be a deathtrap in an earthquake, and the hill was probably already falling into the backyard. I considered rectifying it. She was no good to me under forty tons of clay and detritus. She was only any good writhing under my hips like a pinned kitten. God, she was one big nerve ending, that girl, and those big brown eyes got just a little wider when she was close. And those bruises. And how she begged for them.

I knew she was special the night I met her, I just didn't know how special.

I'd gone up to K with Eddie and two other guys from Penn. I was meeting Wendy afterward in one of the hotel rooms. I had one foot in LA from a disaster of a trip to New York, and the other in Seoul for a trip that could not, under any circumstances be anything but a roaring success, or I was going to have to answer questions. I hated answering questions.

So I'd just done the easy thing and took them to K. There had been plenty of nonsense before the tall girl with big, black eyes and long brown hair twisted into braids brought our drinks. The guys were bullshitting about ball and women, when we all stopped to watch waitress come toward us. The night was over. I couldn't take my eyes off her. Everything was in the right place, naturally. My staff has to look as stunning as the guests. But this girl wasn't just beautiful, because they all are, she was something else entirely. I was trying to figure out what it was, and she just looked right back at me, as if daring me to make an even bigger ass of myself.

Then she spilled gin on me, and Freddie fired her. The guys tried to reason with Freddie, but the waitress was gone and I had to let him do his job however he saw fit. I was an hour to Wendy with her legs up in the air and I suddenly found the idea depressing. She was gorgeous and shrill and shallow. She blew too much coke and giggled at all the wrong times. She exhausted me. The thought of another night in one of my hotel rooms drained the life out of my limbs.

Freddie told me the waitress's name, and that she was a sexual harassment case waiting to happen. But I couldn't let the ebony-eyed girl walk away. I had to look at her again. Five minutes. I'd give her a severance. Whatever.

I heard her outside my office and I seized up a little. I wanted to look at her, but had to be discreet. She slipped in, and I wanted to f**k her immediately. She was so long, so curved, so smooth. Her skirt cupped her ass, and her heels brought her to a couple of inches shorter than me. As my eyes dragged over her br**sts, and over the length of her neck, I realized she'd seen me looking again. She put her hands on her hips. Definitely a harassment case waiting to happen, especially considering she was telling me about Freddie's f**king stupidity. I looked into her eyes. Fire, and pride. Not an ounce of fear. What was going on with that gaze was ten times more interesting than the curves of her body.

"I was going to offer you severance," I'd said.

"I don't want your money," she'd shot back.

"Let me finish."

She obeyed not just with her mouth, but her heart. Her face got red and she cast her eyes down. Her fingers twitched, but didn't move otherwise. Holy f**k. I almost lost my breath. This gorgeous, proud creature was submissive.

I couldn't let her walk into Los Angeles and disappear.

And it had only gotten worse since. Of course, I couldn't fall in love with her, even if I tried, but I could pass a lot of time with her. A lot.

I wanted to know every twitch, every growl, every moment of desperate need, and eat her alive. If she needed me to be exclusive, I could do it. I'd just put Sharon on ice and stop looking around. How long could Monica last? A month? Two? How long could she make me laugh before she started asking for more? How many things could leave her lips that would make me want to put my face on hers? She couldn't stay so attractive for long. She'd burn herself out soon enough, but for the time being, I could not have created a more flawless woman.

I felt bad about bruising her, but I hadn't done half the damage her ex-boyfriend's piece had done. What a dick. And as soon as I saw that guy, what he'd done, and the way he looked at her, I wanted her for myself. I knew she was going to ask for exclusivity, I could see it in her face, and once I saw that piece, I was ready to give it to her. The thought of her getting hurt bothered me. It wasn't her personally as much as it was wrong to make their private business so public. It wasn't that hearing her cry made my fist clench, or that I felt as though I saw some shameful part of her she'd wanted to keep hidden. It was an overall, amoral wrongness. Could have been anyone, and I would have been just as mad.

Well, maybe not as mad.

Damn. I should have taken her home. I had a weird compulsion to reach out to her.

-Thank you for tonight. I'll call you during the week to check on that baseball-

-You're welcome-

A flat, emotionless response. Odd. I regretted letting her out of arm's reach.

-Speaking of...They're playing the Mets the day after I get back-

-Ok good night-

I sat back. Not even a joke or wisecrack. I shouldn't have cared, but I did. My phone dinged again, but it wasn't Monica loosening up. It was Jess.

Interesting that Erik wasn't there. He usually followed her around like a little beta puppy. Exactly what she needed. Half a man. I took a calming breath and called her.

"Jess."

"Jon. Where are you?"

She didn't sound good, and if I judged the whooshing background right, she was already home.

"Coming up LFB." Our shortcut for Los Feliz Boulevard, from when I was whole and had someone to make up little acronyms with.

"Are you alone?"

"Lil is driving. What's wrong, baby?" I could have guessed it was Erik, but she'd never admit it.

"Can I see you?"

I looked at my watch. My plane was scheduled out of Santa Monica at six. I could make it if I left Venice by four. If history was any indication though, I'd be out of there in an hour. I wished I could tell her no, but we had too much history, too much intimacy to just turn my back. So I let Lil take me home, then I got into the Mercedes and went to Venice.

Again.

***

Jessica lived on the beach, as her publicly sunny demeanor demanded. I parked and walked up the long stairway to the back, where the pool overlooked the ocean. The furniture was gone, as was the barbecue. She stood alone at the half empty bar with her glass of white wine, still wearing her flowing white dress. It outlined the shape of her body in the breeze, making me think immediately of pulling her legs open, but gently. That brought my hot little goddess back to mind, because with her, gentle was optional. I should have nailed her in the car, bruises or no. I wasn't any less aroused than her, and now I was in a dangerous position. I wanted to f**k. I had a weight at the base of my c**k that needed to drop, somewhere, somehow.

"Jess," I said when I could see her puffy eyes. "Wasn't there a party or something? After the opening?"

"I couldn't take it any more. Smile, talk about popsicle sticks and culture's effects on childhood memories. Smile. Answer process questions about keeping dead trees alive. Smile again. How are you?"

I snapped a glass off the rack, and Jessica poured me some wine. "I'm fine, really. You called me over here to ask me how I am? It looks like I should be asking you the question."

She barely paused before getting to the point. "Erik."

"I thought you were engaged."

"So did I. Do you want to sit?" She indicated the indoor patio behind sliding glass doors.

The thought of going inside and lounging on a couch with her, which I'd done a hundred times, somehow seemed too risky, so I slid onto a barstool. "Where's everything? Those hideous f**king lamps are gone."

She took a deep breath and swished her wine around. "Three days ago, he took them. They were his."

"Figured." I didn't know what she wanted. Was I supposed to sympathize? She had dozens of girlfriends, each with two shoulders to cry on. What the hell was I doing there?

"He found out you were coming to the opening. And he just went off. 'Why's this guy still hanging around? Why can't you cut him loose?' Blah blah." She downed her wine. "He doesn't understand. Or didn't understand. As you can see, he decided to stop trying, which I guess is for the best."

"I'm sorry to hear it, but I'm not taking the blame for it."

"Jon. You don't have to get defensive."

"Jess. What do you want, if not to blame me?"

She was a bundle of nerves, which no other person would notice because she never wasted a movement. She didn't have a set of sweet little tics like Monica. Jessica was still water, her tension revealed in her gaze, which sat in the middle distance.

"I should be frank," she said.

"You be anyone you want."

"Not funny."

I waited until she was ready, because she'd get to it if I stopped cracking wise, and I had the feeling I would want to hear it.

She took a deep breath. "I think Erik had something. I think he was seeing something I was pretending wasn't there."

She was squirming. Oh, this was good. Delicious even. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to assume she was going where I thought she was because I didn't want the rug pulled from under me again. It wouldn't be the first time she'd implied she wanted me back and then turned the conversation back on itself.

"You've always been there for me." She looked up, right at me.

"We were married," I said. "I told you, I take that seriously."

She took half a step toward me. I'd been through that before with her, and I wouldn't lean into her half a centimeter I didn't have to. I hoped with the same fervor, but I was gun shy. Even when she put her fingers on top of my hand, which she hadn't done in a while, I was torn. After the divorce, she'd still touch me, but she'd back off like a hosed down cat as soon as I went for her. I was impatient with the games and horny as hell from being around Monica. I felt like a caged animal.

So when she touched my face, I froze, convinced I would spin her by the hair and bend her over. That wouldn't do at all. Not if I was going to have her again.

"You're being shy, Jon. That's not like you."

"You going to push me away?"

"No. Not this time."

Fine. I put my hands on the sides of her face so she couldn't turn and pushed her against the bar. I choked off her squeak with a kiss. She kissed me back. She really did.

The drop in my chest was relief. My stomach tightened. To have my life back. To be back to normal again. With my wife at my side, a sealed unit, unbreakable. I touched my old self when I put my hand on her breast. The completed me, at my fingertips.

I pulled her skirt around her hips and hitched her up. She put her legs around my waist, and I carried her inside.

It was dark with those ass-ugly lamps gone. I wanted light to see her, to believe it. Oh, anything could go wrong between us writhing on the couch and me actually getting my dick in her. I remembered my promise to Monica, but I could explain the next day. I'd be sorry to see that sweet thing go, but woman would tolerate infidelity, and I cared too much about both of them to sneak around. Jessica had to be my choice. I'd taken a vow, begged for it to be honored, and waited so long that turning away the possibility of a reunion seemed ludicrous.

I pulled the top of her dress down.

Gorgeous in the moonlight. Those br**sts, with little rocks for ni**les at the tips. I sucked them and tasted her. The taste of me being normal again. The taste of morning dew and cut grass. I rolled her nipple over my tongue and pushed my hips into her. I whispered her name in a fog of relief and delight. I could barely breathe.

"Are you sure, Jess?" She'd better be sure. Between her and that delicious little girl in Echo Park, I was a throbbing rock.

"Yes, baby. Make love to me like you used to. In the beginning."

Yes, I wanted to. And I might have. If she hadn't asked for the old me back, I might have been as sweet and gentle as our first night. But in my ear, as if she sat right next to me, I heard Monica moan, "Hurt me, Jonathan. Tear me in two." I got even harder, if that was possible, and I was at the point where I could expect to walk out of there with a pair of ten pound weights between my legs. I was too old for that shit.

I faced Jessica. She was beautiful. Exactly the girl I remembered. Her lips were parted, her breathing shallow as she pushed her hips into me. So close. I was so close to having her again.

"I'm sorry, Jess."

"For what?"

"This." I pulled myself off her and sat down by her feet.

She propped herself on her elbows, legs still spread. "What? Why?"

I stroked her calf and looked in her face, half cast in the moonlight. "Because. It's been too much. I just... I can't."

She tucked her legs away and crouched, kneeling by me. She touched my face, and I saw her hurt. She had a deep fear of loneliness. Leaving her alone would undoubtedly be the hardest thing I ever did. "I don't understand," she said. "Is this spite? Or revenge?"

I got up. I owed her honesty, at least, after everything we'd been through, after all I'd promised her, after all the times we'd hurt each other. "It's too late. I'm sorry. I'm not the same man."

"Is it that girl?"

"Which girl?" I knew exactly who she meant. I was suddenly sorry I'd brought Monica to the show. Had I known Erik had walked out, I would have kept her home and writhed around with her all night, just to shield her from my ex-wife's eyes. The thought of that bruised ass, and her attitude about it, even the guilt I'd felt at giving it to her, made my dick twitch to the point of pain. "It's a dalliance, Jess. Don't try to read more into it."

Jessica didn't answer. She just stared at me as if she was reading a book. She must have seen right through me.

"Just go, then," she said quietly.

I wanted to say more, to apologize again or offer some comfort, but in a quarter of a second, I thought better of it. The front door. I just had to make it to the front door. I took long strides, looping my fingers in my keyring as I stepped into the night air. My Mercedes was five steps away. It had been her favorite. That's why I'd brought it. Maybe it was time to get rid of it.

"Jon," she called out. I took another step, getting my hand on the car, not looking back. I didn't want to change my mind. I didn't want another argument. I thought maybe I could get back to Echo Park in time to not make a rude ass of myself in front of Monica.

I couldn't pretend I hadn't heard Jessica. I looked back, just to say good-bye. I didn't see her immediately, but once my eyes scanned the front walk, I saw her, balled up on the ground.

The visit was getting more dramatic than I'd anticipated. Did she feel this way when I'd gotten on my knees and begged her to stay? I'd been such a mess of tears I couldn't remember her expression. God, I'd never do that again.

She cradled her arm. I went to her, and from the way she looked at me, I knew I wasn't getting to my little goddess of Echo Park that night.

***

Dr. Fuhr was in Aruba, but a few phone calls and he'd managed to get us skipped ahead in the emergency room if we could get to Cedars in twenty minutes. It was late enough that the 10 was clear, and we zipped along with the top up, an ice pack on Jessica's arm and a sulk on her face.

"She's pretty," Jessica said.

"Who?" I asked as if I didn't know.

"The girl from tonight. Are they all that pretty?"

"Mostly," I lied.

She looked out the window. "Do they all let you f**k them the way you like it?"

The foul language brought my breath in. That wasn't her way of speaking, and her tone prodded. I took the bait because it was late, my balls ached, and Dr. Fuhr hadn't been available.

"How do I like it, Jess? Maybe you can just repeat back to me what you told all your friends?"

"I needed to tell someone!"

"Everyone. You told everyone that I wanted to beat you. Beat you?"

"You changed, Jon. I was scared."

We'd been through it so many times, the tracks of the argument were smooth and well worn, but that felt different. It felt like the last time.

"I changed because you changed me. And I'll always be grateful. You made me right with myself."

"And right with yourself means you want to tie women up and hurt them."

"I don't want to hurt anyone. You're so f**king vanilla, Jess. It's like a religion. You can't see outside it."

I turned into the ER at Cedars, not facing her until I parked. Tears dampened her face. I hadn't heard her crying in the white noise of the freeway.

I put my hand on hers, but she shook it off.

"I wish we could go back to the way we were," she said.

"I don't."

***

Erik came an hour later, as she was in the x-ray room. We shook hands like gentlemen.

"Nothing happened," I told him. "She's all yours."

The blonde lock drooping over his forehead swayed. He owned a surfboard company, but his face was permanently tanned from twenty years on the waves. "She never was."

"Well, honestly, this is the last time I'm coming running. I'm done. And I'm sorry I had my foot in your yard for so long."

We shook hands again, and I put my hand on his arm because I was really, terribly sorry I'd caused him grief over a woman who was completely wrong for me.

***

It wasn't until I got on the 10 that I started to feel as if a weight had been lifted from my shoulders. I pulled off on Mulholland to feel the Merc take the curves like a lumbering behemoth for the last time. I hated that goddamn car. I would get rid of it immediately. A smile spread across my face, and I laughed so hard I had to pull over. Laughter overtook me, turning to tears and back to a deep, silent laughter in my chest again. From relief. From a break in tension. From sheer joy. I was free. Fucking free.

The car was too small to contain me. I got out and sat on the railing, looking over the city, quiet, tearful bursts overtaking me. I looked at my phone, wanting to say something, connect with someone, but I couldn't conceive the words.

When I recognized where I was, I sobered up. I'd kissed Monica for the first time there. I felt a stabbing twinge in my twisted balls. Oh God, I could have her. I could own her. She could be mine, without hesitation or reservation. Mine. The relief turned into excitement.

I looked at the time. I'd have to wait.

Thinking of Monica, I got calm and focused on my phone.

Fuck. Her voice squeaked with nerves. Bad start. I should have told her to be dressed when I texted her. Total miss on my part.

"No, baby. You're fine. We have to talk, and it's hard to do that with your beautiful ass in my face."

I held out my hand and helped her up. Her face was a blank slate of fear. She had no reason to look scared with me. When we met, any implication of my displeasure was greeted by her acceptance of punishment I had no intention of meting out. It wasn't my thing, but history was hard to shake. She held onto my hand, then pulled it toward her mouth. I twisted away and cupped her cheek. Her grey-blue eyes were full of questions, and her lips were pressed tight, not a position I was used to seeing them in.

"Where do you want to go for breakfast?"

"Wherever you like, Sir."

"Can we not play right now?"

Her posture changed from erect to relaxed. "So," she said, "who is she? Or did the wife come to her senses?"

I smiled. She couldn't have dropped character like that two years ago. "Are you going to get dressed or is the whole town getting a look at you?"

***

Jessica hadn't up and left a perfectly happy marriage. This took a year or more for me to sort out. As I'd become more comfortable with my past, and the man I was, I changed. I became sexually dominant and emotionally controlling. I wanted her to submit to me in bed, which she wouldn't have any of. I wanted her body to be available to me more often, which annoyed her. I wanted her to dress for me, even if I wasn't there. I wanted her to do things during the day, when we were apart. Simple things. Touch herself. Roll her sleeves up. Open her legs. Say my name. It made me feel as though we were connected, but she didn't want to play the game, at all. I became frustrated and unsatisfied. We both dug in, and by the time I was willing to cave on both points to keep her, it was too late.

It had been my fault. I had no idea what I was doing. I didn't know what to ask or what I wanted, I only knew I had new ideas, new excitement, new desires. My requests sounded like demands, when they should have been demands that sounded like requests. I became, in two words, a controlling ass**le.

To Sharon, however, I was a sweetheart, and through her and Debbie's stories, I learned just how kinky the kinky world was. I learned how her past men had done things and adjusted what I did to suit me and show her a life that wasn't based on fear, where her needs weren't just important but pleasurable for both of us. It was a shame I couldn't work up an emotion outside general tenderness in the two and some years I'd known her.

Sharon chose a place we'd gone to a hundred times before, with coffee handpicked by college graduates, roasted in the sun only during working hours, trucked in on fuel-efficient vehicles, and made onsite with organic water.

She had her hair tied back with a black velvet twist I'd used to bind her any number of times. No doubt she wore it on purpose. She was used to getting by on her looks and had little to recommend her in the way of conversational skills, but she wasn't stupid. She leaned on her elbows over her skinny latte.

"So?"

"So." I sipped my black coffee. "I wanted to tell you what you've meant to me. You helped me define things I thought had no definition. You've had a big part in making me whole again. I want to thank you for that."

"You never answered my question. The wife or someone else?"

Our relationship was built on honesty and trust but not on fidelity. She'd been on the lookout for a more permanent, full-time Dom, and I'd been searching for what I wanted out of a woman at all. "Both," I said.

"The wife's going to share? I thought she was vanilla?"

"No. Jessica's not going to share, but she did almost get me in the sack. I resisted."

"No way! And you turned her down? Why?"

Sharon was rapt. My life's dramas always interested her, yet she'd never betrayed a confidence. "Because I just didn't want her. Honestly. Just didn't. And also, there's someone I promised myself to, at least for the time being."

"Tell me."

"I probably shouldn't."

"What does she look like?"

I shrugged. "Nothing special."

"Oh, please."

I slipped my hand into hers and squeezed it. "You going to be okay without me?"

"You only show up once a month, and you're too gentle anyway."

"Without the tasks and the discipline and knowing I'm there. Are you going to be okay?"

"I think so."

"No ass**les."

She took my hand in both of hers and looked me in the eye. "No ass**les."

"The apartment. Do you want it?"

"I have some modeling things coming up. I'll pay you for it." I cocked my head at her. She knew what that place cost. "Installment plan."

"Fine."

"Is she short? Tall? How old?"

There is nothing like a woman's curiosity about other women. She'd never imply or even admit to herself she felt an ounce of competition between herself and Monica, yet she had to know so she could compare herself and decide if she was okay with it.

"I meet a lot of beautiful girls," I said. "She's... I don't know. The first time I talked to her, in my office, she was a waitress at my hotel. I looked at her, trying to figure out why she looked so tangible, so present. Every curve looked exactly right. Even her skin is this perfect color... Not even color. The texture of it. I wanted to touch it like I'd never wanted to touch anything before. She saw me looking, and she stood with her hands on her hips, daring me to get an eyeful. No fear. She filled that f**king room." I sipped my coffee. "She took my breath away. I was too stunned to even ask her out."

"So?" Sharon might have been watching the last fifteen minutes of a Lifetime movie, her attention was so focused.

"So I got her a job at the Stock, where Debbie works. I figured she could check her out, tell me if I was crazy."

"So smart, you. What did she say?"

"You know Debbie. She won't rest until everyone's happily coupled off but her."

I sensed rue in Sharon's smile. I rested my hand on her forearm. "You'll find someone, baby."

She shrugged. "Maybe. I don't think it matters. Can you stay for one last f**k?"

I checked my watch as if it was a possibility. "Got a meeting with Tim LaShaun from District 34. Then a tenant's advocacy group that wants my head on a stick. More bullshit tomorrow and the next."

She nodded. I always had at least that much bullshit when I came to San Francisco, but things was different, and she knew it. There wouldn't be one last f**k. I'd done it. I'd come out unscathed and true to my word. I was less confident about Sharon. She had a way of putting a nice face on everything until she decided the pain was too much to bear.

We parted outside. I gave her a hug and a kiss on the cheek. I felt that relief again, but unlike the previous night, when I'd walked out on Jessica, it felt less like getting hit in the head by a two-by-four.

My phone rang as I put Sharon in a cab.

"Hi, Debbie," I answered as I handed the valet my ticket. "Speak of the devil. I was just with Sharon."

As usual, she wasted no time getting to the point. "Jessica met Monica last night?"

"Correct."

"She came here and insisted on sitting at her station."

Ugly. It was just like Jessica to highlight any class difference she could tease out. Having Monica serve her would be a way to humiliate her with a smile.

Debbie continued, "I don't expect you to do anything about it. Except your wife-"

"Ex-wife."

"She said something to Monica. I don't know what, but now the girl looks like she's been slapped."

My fingers got ice cold. Jessica could have said a hundred things, secrets she could have revealed or implied. A million half-truths. Without a man to lean on, she was a cornered animal. I'd forgotten how dangerous she was when I was busy choosing another woman over her.

"Did you ask Monica?" I asked.

"She won't repeat it."

Apparently, my beautiful goddess was also a woman of honor. "I'll call her."

"She's working the floor, so her phone is off. Fix it, please. I don't like it. The power trip. It's sneaky."

"I will, Debbie. I will."

I hung up. My car came, and I parked it around the corner to give myself a minute to think. What did Jessica know? Everything. What was she willing to share? Or imply? Or use? I had no idea. I knew for sure I wasn't ready to share everything about my past with Monica, not a word or deed I didn't have to, because I'd lose her. Any woman would run for the hills.

I texted Monica before I drove away.

-Can you call me?-

***

When I got out of my first meeting, she still hadn't called. She'd gotten the text, so her silence was intentional.

If I were her, what would I do?

Whatever Jessica had said, I'd be finding out if it was true. So I had to make the investigation impossible to complete. That meant moving Rachel, touching base with each sister, Deirdre especially, and stressing their silence. And Thomas. And the hospital. And dad, who would laugh in my face. And... Fuck. There were too many fires to put out. Too many pieces to move across the chessboard.

I put my phone in my pocket.

It occurred to me that I'd longed for Jessica because she knew all the ugliness of my past. I didn't have to reveal a thing to her. I didn't have to bear the uncertainty and loneliness of wondering what someone thought of me. But if she loved me through it, couldn't someone else? Couldn't someone else keep a secret or ten? Maybe, but I was getting ahead of myself. I was letting my excitement get ahead of my sense. I had to finish up here and get back to LA without panicking.

I made my way to my meeting with the tenant's rights group. That bunch would use that information to take me down, even if I gave them what they wanted. I had to deal with Jessica at some point, no matter what, unless I was willing to live without intimacy the way I wanted it. Or I would risk losing Monica before we even started.
