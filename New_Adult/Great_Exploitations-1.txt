The Beginning

TEMPTATION AND FREEDOM. You might not find any relation between those two concepts, but in my world, they go hand-in-hand. In my world, we've discovered a way to market temptation, and freedom is calculated and strategized.

In my world, we sell both.

We're known as the Eves, a tongue-in-cheek tribute to the woman who had the temptation thing down. You won't hear about us in the news, or on the streets, or in the papers. Your best friend's cousin didn't grow up with one of us, and we weren't in the same sorority as you.

We're the hiccups in society. We're women without names. Our fingerprints can't be traced. We're invisible.

How do we do this?

We hide in plain sight.

You might pass us every single day. You might serve us our morning coffee or fit us for a cocktail dress. You might swipe our membership card at the gym or wax our most private of parts.

You might think you can read me like a book, but you'd be as wrong as everyone before you who tried.

Eves don't do personal. We don't do happy hours, book clubs, or girls' nights. We don't rent apartments. We don't keep a P.O. Box. We never get put on a case where our old acquaintances might be. We cut off all ties with our past. We don't do boyfriends, boy-toys, or one-night stands.

I deal in one thing and one thing only. It consumes my life. It consumes me.

I generate temptation in order to impart freedom.

A freedom I was denied.

How do I manipulate the temptation/freedom equation?

I pluck the apple from the tree.

In twenty-first century terms?

Infidelity.

Yes, I know that right after the word adultery, infidelity is one of the most controversial and hated words. Just thinking about it can make a woman squirm in her seat. But if you remove all the emotion and bias, it's nothing more than a word. The act behind that word is something else entirely. It can be unplanned, spontaneous, unintentional, or in my case, calculated.

We're not a charity, and we don't work pro bono. We charge a pretty penny, but I haven't run across a Client yet who didn't think the service we provide was worth every cent. Before anyone goes and calls the women's movement on us, hear me out. It isn't the men we're benefitting with the service we provide. It's the women. The wives, specifically.

Our Clients are the women who fell in love with a man with enough dollar signs behind his name to require a pre-nuptial agreement. That same woman who, months or years later, finds her beloved husband isn't the loving, honest, and faithful person she'd hoped (perhaps, naively) he'd be. That same woman who would come out on the other end of a divorce with nothing. Not one damn dime because she fell in love, signed her name on some document, and the mister with a wandering eye and dick couldn't keep either to himself.

That is where the Eves come in. That is where I come in. It's what I know. It's what I'm good at. And it's what's going to pave the road for my own freedom.

I'm in the business of great exploitations.

The Meet

IF I HAD a dollar for every time the Meet took place at some posh, upper-crust spa, I could have made a down payment on the BMW 640 convertible I was zipping around in. Of course, with the balance in my international bank account, I could have purchased it outright, along with a dozen of its luxury counterparts. Even if I wanted to own the flashy, sex-on-wheels car I was cruising in, buying it was out of the question.

Car ownership meant titles, which meant personal information.

The car belongs to G. I think. G's the top-dog. She's the president, CEO, gate-keeper, and founder of the Eves. She discovered each of us, recruited us, and went on to train us. She gives us our marching orders and monitors us. We report back to her. Basically, she's the almighty, omniscient, in G we trust. I don't know what G stands for, or if it stands for anything, but I like to think of it as being short for The Godmother.

She watches over all of us, making sure our needs are met, but don't piss her off unless you want to find a horse head between your sheets. I've followed that rule from day one, and it hasn't yet steered me wrong.

G found me five years ago. Alone. Scared. Close to rock bottom. She picked me up, made me dust myself off, and trained me to be one of the most successful Eves in her little black book.

She'd never admit it, but I knew I was one of her favorites. She reluctantly dotes on me-that's why I got the Miami case when it came up. She knows I'm a sucker for warm weather and white-sand beaches. After my four-week stint in Lansing during a particularly harsh winter, I needed a trip south. I felt the heat and humidity soothing my skin even inside of the car. I'd never taken longer than a month to finish a job, but I wouldn't have minded if this one ran longer.

When I pulled up to the spa where I was meeting the Client, the only parking option was valet. A super posh spa was to be expected when the Client's an Eight. After a string of Sevens, it was about goddamned time I got an Eight.

Errands were named after the number of digits in the bank account involved in the Errand, or in laymen's terms, job. If you were to look up the definition of errand-a short journey undertaken in order to deliver or collect something, often on someone else's behalf-that's pretty much the exact definition of what we do.

A Seven Errand is basically a dime a dozen, Eights crop up a few times a year, and a Nine is practically unheard of. The last Nine one of the Eves worked was over three years earlier.

And Tens ... well, they're completely unheard of. Tens are the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow that's always just out of reach. If I landed myself a Ten job, I'd be set. My retirement fund would be fully funded, and I'd be out. I'd be free.

A Ten would mean a fifty million payout. A twenty-five million take-home for the Eve and the other twenty-five to G and the "business."

After working so many Sevens with a five-hundred-K fifty-fifty split, I was ready for something big. However, one doesn't simply stumble upon a Ten. Tens don't fall into your lap. Plus, I never knew what my next job would be. Maybe after wrapping up the Eight up for a one million fifty-fifty split, G would have a nice, fat Nine she'd be willing to send my way.

But it wasn't time to dream of Nines and Tens. It was time to kick-start an Eight. Game time.

The valet who loped up to my car when I stopped in front of the spa doors flashed me a smile. I moved my sunglasses back onto my head, grabbed my purse, and slid out of my seat when he opened the door.

His smile shifted higher on one side. "Hello, ma'am."

"Good morning." I returned his smile with a small one of my own. He had a case of the ogly eyes, a PG way of saying something about me made his dick twitch. I was trained to notice those kinds of things-it was what made me good at my job-but this cute young man wasn't the one whose dick I needed to get to do anything.

I handed him a twenty, grabbed my briefcase, and started for the spa entrance.

"I get off at three," he said after me, confidence oozing from his tone.

When I glanced back at him, his expression was as confident as his voice ... and I got it. I got where that confidence came from. He was good-looking, built, and had a killer smile. Women rarely turned him down. He was confident and obviously unused to rejection. Basically, he was the young, poor, valet version of what I deal with every day. He couldn't be much younger than I was, but when I looked in his eyes, I felt old.

Old enough to be his great-great grandmother. So I looked away.

"And I get off on something else entirely," I replied before whisking through the revolving doors.

I didn't look back; I never did. Even if I had wanted to let that boy bend me over the hood of my car, that went against the rules. My body wasn't my own to do whatever I wanted with it. It was on lease to the Eves until the day I retired or, lord forbid, the day I was disavowed.

I'd only known of one Eve to have been disavowed. She was found dead in a back alley a week later. I didn't believe in coincidences, that one, which G assured me was one, included.

I shook off all thoughts of disavowing and back alleys as I meandered inside. The spa didn't even try to be understated. From the floors, to the lighting, to the large, counter-shaped aquarium of a front desk, everything was ostentatious. I guessed if you would pay five bills for an eyebrow waxing or fifteen for a seaweed and gold dust body wrap, ostentatious was the theme of the whole shebang.

"Namaste," the woman in a red silk kimono said as I approached the aquarium-slash-counter.

Even the greeting was ostentatious. Or was it more pretentious? It was something 'tious.

"Howdy-do," I said, just because I couldn't resist.

"Did you have an appointment?" From her tone, she sounded as though she'd wound those chopsticks into her bun a bit too tightly.

"I'm meeting Mrs. Silva." I wished I had a piece of bubble gum I could pop in my mouth just so I could chomp it loudly in her face.

The woman pursed her lips and scrolled through the tablet in her hands. "She should have just finished up her European facial, so she'll be in the waxing wing."

I didn't even hide my smile. The place had a waxing wing.

They took hair removal seriously.

"Is there a room number I should be on the lookout for? Maybe a map and compass you could loan me in case I get lost?" I usually tried to stay professional when I was "on the clock," but this chick was too much fun.

If lips could get more pursed, I'd never seen it. "Right this way," she said, whisking out from behind the counter.

I followed that fury of red silk to, indeed, the waxing wing. From the size of the spa, they probably had wings for everything else, too.

When she stopped outside of a door, she knocked once, then opened the door a crack. "Your guest has arrived, Mrs. Silva. Would you like to see her now or would you like me to have her wait in the visitor's lounge?" I didn't need two guesses to know where red-silk-kimono wanted to put me.

"Send her in," a soft voice replied. I'd never spoken with Mrs. Silva, but her voice sounded exactly like the rest of my Clients at their Meet: shaky, hesitant, a shade below scared-shitless. That was good. I'd be worried if I ever met a confident Client.

The woman opened the door farther and gave me a Fine look before stepping aside.

I gave her an overdone smile as I slipped inside. "Namaste."

That Fine look flew five rungs up to an impressive Fuck you.

Pissing off stick-up-their-ass bitches = perk of the job.

After slipping inside, I closed the door. Mrs. Silva was reclined on a table and mid-wince. I wasn't sure if that was due to me or the waxer about to rip a strip from her calf.

The woman tore that strip off, and Mrs. Silva flinched. I couldn't remember the last time I'd flinched over a waxing. I barely blinked when the final strip of my last Brazilian was torn off.

"Hello, Mrs. Silva," I said formally. "It's nice to meet you." I gave the waxer, who was busy preparing another strip, a purposeful look.

Thankfully, Mrs. Silva caught it. "Sara, could you give us a few minutes alone, please?"

With a nod, Sara headed for the door. Once we were alone, Mrs. Silva cleared her throat and adjusted her robe, but she didn't make eye contact with me. Again, that was nothing new. I'd never known any of the "Mrs. Silvas" before to be able to look me in the eye.

Maybe it was because they were ashamed of our cloak and dagger arrangement, or maybe it was because they knew I would be in bed with their husband soon, or maybe it was because they were just so beaten down by life they couldn't look anyone in the eyes anymore. I didn't know, and I'd never asked because, quite frankly, I didn't care.

I wasn't a shrink. I provided a service. A means to an end.

"You're younger than I would have thought," she said.

"Oh?" I'd heard that one a bunch, too. When Eves went to a Meet, we didn't dress the part. In fact, we tried to dress the opposite part so, god forbid, if anyone tried to prove a link between the Mr., the Mrs. and the mistress, the woman I looked like with the Mrs. would be the total opposite of the woman I looked like with the Mr. With Mrs. Silva, I wore no makeup, hair in a loose braid, a simple cotton dress, and sandals with no heel. With Mr. Silva ... well, that would be a different story. "If it's any consolation, I've never come across a man who has an issue with a younger woman."

I hadn't meant that as a jab but as a fact to reassure her. I might as well have slapped her from the pain flashing across her face.

She stared absently at the sparkling rock on her left hand. "No, I'm sure you haven't."

"Do you have the file?" Enough small talk. Time to get down to the reason I was there.

Mrs. Silva lifted her chin at the chair across the room. "It's the manila folder inside my bag."

I dialed the access code into my briefcase as I headed toward her bag. "Everything's in there?"

"Yes," she replied, "I think so."

I made a face only because my back was to her. "You think so? We're not going to get this done with you just thinking so, Mrs. Silva." I pulled the thick folder from her bag and lifted it. "Is. Everything. In. Here?"

"It is." Her voice took on that tell-tale wobble. That twinge of nostalgia for the good days with her soon-to-be ex combined with the overtone of what-the-hell-am-I-doing? The surest way to get rid of the wobble before it turned into anything more was to barge ahead.

Once I'd stuffed the file inside my briefcase, I slid out one of the shiny black phones. "Here's your phone." I held it up for her to see before dropping it into her bag. "You only use it to call or text me, and it had better be an emergency if you do call or text me. Okay?"

Mrs. Silva nodded her head. A nod wouldn't cut it. We weren't playing a child's game of truth or dare; the job was an intricate task that needed to be meticulously executed in order for all of the chips to fall just the way we were orchestrating them.

"Okay, Mrs. Silva?" There was an edge to my voice when I repeated the question.

"Okay," she said, bobbing her head. She couldn't look away from the ring on her left hand. Too bad she hadn't gotten cold feet on her wedding day instead.

I continued, so familiar with the speech I felt like a flight attendant giving the pre-flight spiel. "My number's programmed in there. I will text you four times and four times only. You won't talk to me or see me after today." One meeting, that was it. Eve rule number two? Keep contact with the Client to an absolute minimum. Why? Each wife might have contracted us to do the job, but they were women trying to divorce their husbands for cheating, which meant jealousy ran deep and heavy in the blood. The less they saw of the woman about to seduce their husband, the better. "I will send you a G when I've made contact with your husband. I will text you an H for when I've got him on the hook. I will text you a time and an address where the Errand will be finalized, and I will text you a V when it's done."

"Errand?Finalized?" Mrs. Silva's eyebrows came together. "Why don't we just call a spade a spade and exchange finalizing the Errand for you f**king my husband?"

Bitterness. We were moving right along the roller coaster of emotions at the Meet. Only a couple more to go, and I'd be out of there.

I kept calm because it served no purpose for both women to become emotional. "If you want to call it like it is, I think finalizing the Errand would be better characterized as me f**king your husband because you want out, you want your cut, and you hired me to." I arched an eyebrow and approached her. "Since we've got that out of the way, may we continue?"

Oh, and there it was. The first tear.

Sadness: check.

"How can you be so calm? How can you stand there and pretend I'm asking you to do nothing more than drop my husband's shirts off at the dry cleaners?" she said, flailing her hands about as she struggled to catch her breath. We were getting close to the next one: mild hysteria.

My instinct was to hug her, or grab her hand, to offer some measure of comfort. But I didn't. I wasn't one of the best because I'd turned off my instincts; I was one of the best because I'd learned how to manage them.

Don't get personal.

I'd held to that rule, and it had never done me wrong. Offering comfort was too personal. Tough love was even too personal. I strived for apathetic logic.

"I stay calm because emotion is a handicap," I explained, clasping my hands to keep from reaching out. "I'm not pretending when I behave like you've hired me to do something no more intimate than dropping your husband's shirts off at the Laundromat. There is no feeling in what I do. No intimacy in what I share. It's sex. The act removed of any and all emotion."

Mrs. Silva gave a little huff and shook her head. "Sorry, sweetheart, but sex is intimate no matter how you try to slice it." Mrs. Silva no longer struggled to calm her breathing. She was back at sad.

I made a non-committal shrug. It had been so long since I'd had "intimate" sex, I forgot what it felt like. I'd forgotten how it felt to fall apart with someone I loved. "Not the kind I have. Sex for me is like a French kiss with a bit more skin and sweat."

She closed her eyes, almost cringing at my words. "I'll take your word for it."

Okay, time to shift the conversation. Avoid talking about the actual seducing and sexing of the Target.

"Once I've sent you the time and location where I'll final-" Mrs. Silva flashed me a quick look of warning. Fine. She wants it straight, I'll give it to her straight. It wasn't me I was softening the truth for. "Where I'll be f**king your husband"-to her credit, Mrs. Silva didn't flinch-"get ahold of your private investigator, detective, photographer, or whoever it is you've got lined up to catch us in the act, and make sure they're there. You've got one chance. Make sure the Contact you've hired will be there because I will not be happy, and G will not be happy, if you drop the ball." I paused, hoping she'd look me in the eyes so I could impress upon her the seriousness of our conversation. She wouldn't look anywhere but at that ring of hers. "I'm the person who does their job. Make sure you are, too."

After a few moments, Mrs. Silva tightened the belt on her bathrobe and sat up taller. "Anything else?"

Ah, there it was. We were almost done. She'd almost reached acceptance. Once we were there, I was out.

"Yeah, there is," I said as I snapped my briefcase closed. "I'm sure G pounded it into you already, but in case you missed any of the keep-quiet-or-else speech, here's a recap. Don't. Say. Anything. About. The. Eves. Not to your Contact, not to your mother, not to your B.F.F., not to your priest, and not even to your little fee-fee dog. We help you now, you help us by keeping silent in the future." To date, not a single Client had slipped, but if one ever did, the fallout would be disastrous.

Mrs. Silva almost smiled, although it wasn't a particularly friendly one. "Not to mention I help you out by paying you."

Look who was playing the moral high-road game now? I hadn't seen that rebuttal coming from the mostly sad and silent Mrs. Silva, and I could usually spot a holier-than-thou show before I stepped foot into the Meet room.

"Not to mention we're helping you come out on the other end of a divorce with fifty percent of your husband's worth." I made my way to the door. I had a file to study, and Mrs. Silva had legs to be waxed. "I'd say that's the gift that keeps on giving for the rest of your life. Wouldn't you, Mrs. Silva?"

She laughed tightly. "You and G aren't nearly as intimidating as you think you are."

Oh, dear god. Right after the actual act of screwing the Target, the Meet was my least favorite part of the whole gig. "That's because you just met us. This isn't a threat, and it's not a warning. It's the truth. Get your divorce, take your money, and forget about us."

"Just don't forget to pay you, right?"

I knew she was trying to ruffle my feathers. So many had tried before her, and like her, every one of them had failed. To ruffle my feathers, they had to have some sort of emotional pull over me. My Clients didn't. Neither did my Targets.

"You can forget if you want," I said, giving her a tilted smile. "But G won't."

Mrs. Silva chuckled again. Not quite as much ice but still enough to make the room a bit chilly. "My husband's careful-discreet," she said, and there it was: acceptance. I saw it in her eyes after she'd finally managed to look me in mine. I was out. "He won't just tumble into bed if you bat your eyes at him. I hope you're good."

No wife ever wanted to know just how good I was.

"You and I wouldn't be here now if I wasn't." Before I slipped out of the door, I worked up a small smile. Less than five minutes we'd ever speak to one another, and yet, two lives were affected by that handful of minutes. It had taken me some getting used to at first, but eventually, the goodbye smile came naturally. The smile that said I'm sorry, Good luck, and Nice doing business all at the same time. "Goodbye, Mrs. Silva."

"Goodbye ..."-interrupted by a long sigh-"Eve."

I closed the door and headed down the hall. Clients never knew our names. Our real names or the names we took on for the Errand. It was easier when there wasn't a name. Names were personal. Even fake ones.

After navigating my way down the wax "wing," I headed past the aquarium counter and red-silk-kimono girl again. Plastering on a smile, I folded my hands beneath my chin, made a small bow, and said, "Namaste" in as saccharine a way as I could.

If not for the guests milling about the waiting area, I was certain kimono girl would have flipped me off or tried scratching my eyes out. I couldn't be sure, but her brand of pissed was especially impressive.

Since it wasn't past three o'clock yet, guess who was first in line when I whisked out of the spa doors?

"Hey, Romeo," I said, totally unaffected by the panty-melting smile he gave me. I was too jaded by men to be affected by a smile. A smile was never just a smile. "Anytime today."

Grabbing my keys from the valet box, his smile jacked a little higher as he jogged by. "Anytime, any day."

I withheld the eye roll that wanted to follow. The guy had a pick-up line for everything. I was sure if I told him to go get bent, he would turn it around into some sort of illicit proposition.

As he ran toward the valet lot, I took the opportunity to check him out. Really, he had one of the finest asses known to woman. The rule was I couldn't touch, not that I couldn't look and looking was the only male satisfaction I got these days.

Valet Look-Can't-Touch was just about out of sight when someone else whisked out of the spa doors. I had to do a double-take because, other than being a little shorter, she looked an awful lot like I did. Or I had before I'd become an Eve. After five years of being dyed, weaved, cut, sculpted, molded, nipped, and tucked, I'd almost forgotten what I'd started out like. But forgetting was impossible with that woman pacing beside me with her cell to her ear.

The resemblance was ... uncanny.

"You know my situation, Mar," clone girl said into the phone, not exactly trying to be discreet. "Unless I want to lose everything, I'm going to live, wrinkle, and die with that sorry excuse for a man."

Even when I was "off the clock," I never really was. More than half of our business came from these kinds of happenstance encounters. Blatantly wealthy woman bitching on the phone, or to her hair stylist, or to the poor waiter, et cetera when an Eve or G was in earshot.

I was already unlocking my briefcase when she paced my way. "Why don't I just leave him? Why. Don't. I. Just. Leave. Him?" she practically shouted into the phone. "Because, Mar, I signed a little piece of paper before I walked down the aisle. In case you're not familiar with a pre-nup, let me give you a quick run-down. In the event of a divorce, I get nothing. Noth-Ing."

I slipped the black business card out of the holder and clutched it. Judging by the way she was decked out and that her handbag alone cost what a middle-class family made annually, I knew this one would be a solid Eight. Maybe, just maybe, a Nine.

And if eery-look-alike girl did come to the Eves for help, G better toss it my way since I'd brought the business in. That's generally the way it worked, and I sure as hell wouldn't give "generally" a break when it came to an Eight, possibly a Nine, Errand.

"He was worth a lot when I married him, but now?" she continued, either not noticing or not caring there was a stranger close by. "You've seen the articles. You know how much that son of a bitch is worth."

At least an Eight.

"I don't know," she said. "I'll think of something." After a clipped goodbye, she slid her phone into her purse.

When opportunity knocks, I don't keep it waiting.

As I approached the woman, I held out the card. The matte, black card was blank expect for The Eves scrolled in elegant white lettering on the front and a number on the back.

The woman studied the card for a few moments before studying me in the same way. With skepticism. "What's this for?"

I saw my car coming around. I had less than thirty seconds to get the card in her hand before the opportunity was gone. "For your husband problem."

She lifted a sculpted eyebrow. "I've got an attorney. A bunch of them, in fact. If some of the best lawyers in the industry can't help me, I doubt you can."

"I'm not a lawyer," I said. "I deal with the gray area in between the laws." I had her interest. I saw it in her eyes.

"What ... gray area?"

My car pulled up the circular driveway, so I extended the card again. That time, she took it. "Give this number a call, and it will all be explained. And that's for your eyes only. No one else sees it, and you don't tell anyone about it. If you choose not to call us, burn, shred-basically, destroy-that card. Got it?" Usually I preferred to ease potential clients into the fine print, but I didn't have time for easing.

The woman flipped the card over and back again before sliding it inside her purse. "Got it," she said, giving me a once-over. Standing taller, she asked, "How do I know you're for real?"

"How do I know you are?" I lifted a shoulder. "Life's a sequence of gambles. You're going to win some. You're going to lose some. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't play the game."

The valet had that same smile on when he leapt out of my car. He flashed me a wink and waited outside of the door for me to climb in. "Have a nice day," I said to the woman.

"I will now." She patted her purse.

I handed another twenty to Valet Romeo before sliding in. "See you around, ma'am," he said with a wink before closing the door.

Tomorrow, I'd look different, and next month, I'd be in a different city in a different state. People never just saw me around. I sighed before punching the gas. "No, you won't."

MY HOTEL FOR this Errand was smack in the center of Ocean Drive in South Beach. G had gone all out and rented me a suite. She wanted me comfortable and happy, which meant the job was an important one. Not that all of them weren't, but some were more high profile than others. Some jobs were high profile because of the risks involved, some because the Client, the Target, or both were public figures, and some were high profile strictly due to the money involved.

Other than his last name, where he lived, how much he was worth, and that I'd be in his bed within the month, I didn't know anything about Mr. Silva. That would be different come morning, though. I'd know his shoe size, the day he was born, his preferences when it came to women, and what he liked in the bedroom. I'd have all the knowledge I'd need to work my way under Mr. Silva's skin so I could work myself into his pants.

But tonight, I had a date with a heavy manila folder and a cherry Coke with extra cherries. I crashed onto the chaise and punched a quick text into my phone strictly for my interaction with G. On any given Errand, I carried around three phones. One for Client communication, one for G communication, and another that was used for the Target. At the end of each Errand, the Client and Target phones were destroyed, and I was given two new ones at the start of the next. It was a pain in the ass, but I hadn't been drawn to the Eves because it was easy.

I suppose, at first, I wasn't as much drawn as I was intrigued, but G helped me change my mind. Our meeting had seemed totally happenstance, but I'd realized after a while that G did nothing by happenstance. Everything was painstakingly strategized, especially when it came to selecting her Eves.

Five years ago, I'd walked into the mall back home with one goal in mind: I would sit in a booth at my favorite little cafe, order a mocha and a bagel, and prove to myself life could go on even when it didn't feel as if it could.

By the time I was standing outside of the cafe, my body betrayed me. I simply couldn't step foot inside of it. It wasn't just my favorite place. It had been our favorite place, but there was no more our. There never would be again.

So instead, I collapsed onto one of the mall benches and stared at that cafe for the rest of the day. Staring at the couples going in and out, glaring at the ones smiling and laughing.

At closing time, a woman took a seat beside me. She was older, but she was one of the most stunning women I'd ever seen. The kind that almost make you want to reach out and touch them to see if they're real.

She sat in silence for a few minutes, then said, "You can spend the rest of your life missing him. Or you can move on and never look back."

I went with G that night, and the rest, as they say, was history. G offered me the move-on part of her promise. But there were times when I slipped and looked back. If there was a way to train myself not to look back, I hadn't figured it out yet, but I'd never stop trying.

G never knew who the guy from my past was, and she didn't know about any of the other ones either. She didn't do backstory. She cared about our present and our future, that was it. Her only rule regarding our past was that we leave it there-behind us-and that we cut off all and any ties to it.

My phone pinged with G's response, bringing me back to the present. Nothing but a G. That was how we communicated. To anyone else, our one-letter messages made no sense, but we knew the whole story behind that one letter.

I dug a cherry out of my soda and popped it into my mouth. I went for one more before opening the file. These things took hours to sort through.

The first few pages held all of the basics: full name, DOB, height, weight, education, career, hobbies, interests, etc. After a quick scan, I pulled another cherry out of my soda.

The next section, or as we Eves liked to call it, the Payday Section, was where I spent the majority of my study time. That section covered his likes and dislikes in and out of the bedroom. It went over his goals, ambitions, and dreams.

In short, it told me everything I needed to know to transform myself into the woman Mr. Daniel Silva couldn't resist. It even told me what color, length, and style of hair he preferred. So after my salon appointment the next day, I'd (once again) be a long-haired blonde who wore her hair down with just a hint of a curl. In my line of work, blonde took the gold medal. Red was a close second.

I flipped to the next page, and there was Mr. Silva in all his mediocre glory. He looked his age-early forties-but had that confidence in his expression that conveyed he thought he was quite the gift. Dark hair and eyes, tall, medium build, handsome in a distinguished, George Clooney type of way, but not in the god-of-a-man way like he obviously perceived himself to be.

I turned the photo over and went to the next page. In the beginning, the next section had made me squirm. I didn't squirm anymore. I'd seen it all when it came to sex preferences, positions, appetites, and fetishes. No Target could shock me. Not anymore.

Mr. Silva was pretty straight forward and in-line with my expectations based on what I'd already gleaned from his file. His preferred position was from behind, and his preferred quantity was once a day. No surprises there. I hadn't run across a man yet who didn't prefer sex once a day, and the from behind part I'd guessed once I knew what hair color he preferred.

Seduction was an art of statistics and probabilities. Every Eve knew a man who wanted a blonde liked giving it from behind, a man who lusted after a redhead liked the woman on top, and a man who liked a brunette preferred classic missionary style. The rules didn't hold true one hundred percent of the time, but at least ninety-five percent, and that was close enough for me to stamp it into the book of truth.

What was surprising though, was that nothing had been filled out below the Sex Fetishes and Other Kinds of Miscellaneous Kinkery section. That section was rarely left blank. Most of the time, the Client ran out of space and had to add additional comments on the back of the sheet. Occasionally, the man who preferred a classic brunette and missionary sex would have a blank space, but never the man who liked a blonde from behind. There was always something else.

These questions weren't meant to be insulting or obtrusive to the Client. We needed to dive down the rabbit hole of sex because that was how I finished my job and finished it quickly. When I knew a man's turn-ons, turn-offs, and everything in between, my job was a hundred times easier. If Mr. Silva didn't have any noteworthy fetishes, then fine. I'd close out the job and realize I still had a thing or two to learn. But if Mrs. Silva had purposefully left the space blank out of embarrassment, a desire for privacy, or because she just didn't want to give me the nitty-gritty details, I would be pissed.

When I'd asked her if everything I needed was in the file and she said yes, she'd better have damn well meant it. I didn't like to flounder my way through an Errand because the Client hadn't done their simple assignment.

A few hours and a second round of extra-cherries cherry Coke later, I slammed the file closed. I'd read every note, pondered over every little clue I could use, and was exhausted.

I knew what kind of clothes to pick up; I knew what kind of makeup to wear. I knew what kind of smile caught his attention and how to shape my mouth to make him hard. I had it all.

Tomorrow I would transform into the blonde, bronze goddess Mr. Silva would come to know as Sienna Stevens. Tonight, though, I would go to bed and fall asleep as myself.

Whoever that person now was.

The Greet

CHAMELEON DAY IS exactly what one would expect. It's the day I pull out my credit card and didn't stop swiping until I'd been dyed, tanned, styled, and primped into the ideal future MRTS. (mistress) of Mr. Silva.

It took most of the morning to get my canvas prepped and ready and most of the afternoon to paint it. I wasn't the biggest fan of the streaking and plucking. It was a necessary evil of the job though. But once my canvas was ready to be painted, I savored the shopping. G gave us a generous stipend at the start of every Errand and let us use it as we saw fit. I used a good chunk of it on Chameleon Day.

After paying the salon-the bill had been in the four digits-I set myself loose on an open air mall in South Beach. After a few hours and few thousand dollars, I had a good Mr. Silva/Miami wardrobe. Mr. Silva's proclivity in the woman's clothing department didn't have any real surprises. Snug-fitting cocktail dresses and stilettos were most men's catnip. I just made sure the dresses were tailored to his specific tastes: short dresses in shades of red that showed off a liberal amount of cl**vage. Mr. Silva really was the stereotypical rich womanizer.

Most of the men I worked with were "stereotypical."

By ten o'clock that night, I'd been up for sixteen hours. My day should have been done, but it was really just getting started.

I handed the BMW keys off to the valet outside of The Pleasure Room, the club in Miami to be seen at on a Friday or Saturday night. The burlesque club was known for giving the audience "The Full Tease," served innovative libations, and was the hangout for at least one A-lister every weekend of the year.

It was the kind of place I'd avoid when I wasn't working. Tonight though, I was making the Greet, and since Mr. Silva owned The Pleasure Room, it was the place to be for Sienna Stevens.

Like all the top clubs in South Beach, The Pleasure Room had a line of bodies wrapped around the building, waiting for their chance to witness the full tease on stage or to bump into whatever Hollywood heart-throb or darling was in there. Me, though? I didn't do lines. Not because I had an over-inflated sense of self, but because time was one of my most precious commodities.

I couldn't afford to wait in a line for hours when I had an Eight's attention to catch. The sooner I finished with Mr. Silva, the sooner I could move on to the next job, the sooner I could reach the magic number in my bank account, hang up my Eve hat, and start enjoying that whole freedom thing.

After finishing my homework the night before, I'd called G to give her the heads up that she might get a call from an unhappy wife to an Eight or a Nine in the next few days. I told her if she did call G, I expected her to assign the job to me since I'd drummed up the business. She told me to focus on Mr. Silva and she would focus on running her business. I might have lost the battle, but I wouldn't lose the war. I wanted that Errand if the Eves got it.

But G was right. I did need to focus on Mr. Silva. He was the Errand. Thinking of previous or future Errands did no good, so I shoved aside everything but why I was there. I couldn't leave until I'd ingratiated my way into Mr. Silva's head. I had to be the itch he couldn't scratch. That would make me the woman he had to have, at all costs.

I put on my game face and walk as I approached the entrance where a couple of men with chests as wide as a Hummer guarded it. One had a checklist, and the other was obviously there just to kick ass if needed. I had their attention, both of their attentions, when I was still fifty feet away.

Those kinds of men-young, invincible, virile ones-could be read like a book. I didn't need a thick manila folder to figure out their individual wants and needs. Men in their twenties were simple. They all wanted and needed the same thing: to stick their dicks in as many women as often as they could.

My job was easy when young men were the gatekeepers to something I needed, specifically to skip the line and saunter inside of those doors in this instance. So, knowing what I did of their many/often needs, my job was to let them assume they could have me. I had to provide exactly the right amount of flirt, say just the right thing to lead them to believe they had a chance in this life and their next to bang me. It was an exact science.

As I approached, I met each of their gazes, gave them a just-barely parted-mouth smile, and added a bit more sway to my step.

The rope was open for me before I'd set foot on the black and gold tile leading up to the club's entrance.

Young men were so easy. Child's play, really.

Once I was inside the club, I understood what all the fuss was about. It was like Disneyland for adults. The Pleasure Room had two floors. The stage was a large square in the center of the room, sectioned off into four individual stages where different dancers performed. A bar area was set up at each end of the room. The rest of the space on the first floor was dance floor, while the second floor looked to mainly be for seating.

Everyone had a smile on their face and a drink in their hand. Everyone was dancing and celebrating like it was the party to end all parties. Everyone was there for a good time. Everyone except for me-I was there to work.

I milled about the room searching for Mr. Silva. He'd be somewhere on the floor. I knew nightclub owners like him from two Errands I'd worked before. They were the kind of men who didn't want to be locked up in an office when the party was happening a floor below them. They were the kind of men who liked to be seen and wanted to be recognized. They thrived off of it.

It was also what they expected, and the best way to get a man's attention was to lead with the unexpected.

I finally saw him. As expected, he was in the middle of a little entourage. All of them were women, and most of them were dancers. He was laughing and touching and charming, just as I'd expected, decked out in a dark blue suit with just enough sheen that the dim light of the club made him stand out from the next guy in a suit. The wedding ring was missing from his left hand, just like every last one of my former Targets. His teeth were fake, as was his tan, but the gleam in his eyes-that predatory, I-take-what-I-want-when-I-want-it-was real. The most real thing about him.

I tipped my shoulders back a bit, arched my back ever so slightly, and started toward Mr. Silva and his female entourage. How would I stand out amongst the couple dozen beautiful women staggered around him?

I would be the only one ignoring him.

Ten more feet and I'd make eye contact for no more than a second or two. Just long enough for him to know I'd noticed him and would keep walking. All men loved the chase and wanted what they couldn't have, but men like Mr. Silva were at the top of the food chain in that department.

I could tell he'd noticed me from the corner of his eyes, and his gaze was just shifting when someone stepped in front of me.

"Damn, now I understand why this is called The Pleasure Room," the young man decked out in a cheap suit said, staring at me with a sideways smile as he fitted his hands to my hips. I knew the look he was giving me had done a job on plenty of women, but I had a built-in B.S. detector when it came to all things male.

I glowered up at him. "And you're about to know it as The Punishment Room from tonight on if you don't get your hands off of me." The guy was big and built, just like ninety-nine percent of the meatheads wandering down Ocean Drive on South Beach, but G made sure to include self-defense training in our Eve education. I knew just where to punch, poke, and prod at a guy to bring him to his knees.

Captain Meathead obviously didn't have a lot going on upstairs because his one-sided smile only shifted higher. He lowered his mouth to my ear. "I like when a girl talks dirty. It makes me imagine the filthy things she'll be cursing up at me when I'm between her legs."

All right. I wouldn't even feel bad when I drove my knee into that dude's nads. Maybe stumbling around for a week with ice strapped to his crotch would beat some sense into his thick-head.

Right before I could deliver knee-to-nads, a voluptuous little thing skidded up beside us. "What the hell, Chad?" she half-shrieked.

"Shea, calm down," Chad instructed, lifting his hands.

Shea didn't calm down. She pretty much went with the opposite. Lifting her blinged out hand, she slapped Chad across his cheek before turning my way. If the chick tried to slap me, she was going down. I didn't do girl drama.

I gave her a warning look and prepared to grab her hand, but she did something I wasn't expecting. She upended her glass of white wine on my chest.

"There," she said, making sure the last drop of wine landed on my dress. "Now I'm calm." Without another word, she flicked her hair and powered away.

"Shea!" Chad called out, flashing me an apologetic look before chasing her.

Muttering a string of curses, I worked my way back into the crowd before Mr. Silva's gaze could drift my way again and find me a livid, wine-soaked mess. I went to every Greet prepared, but that snafu would take a little time to sort out.

I'd had a drink dumped on me before. Thankfully Shea's was only white wine. Let's just say that white linen spattered with bloody mary is beyond repair.

The women's lounge and restroom was at the end of a long, dark hall and was mostly empty. Other than a girl adjusting her cl**vage at the long mirror, I was alone. I dug around in my small clutch until I found a mini-spritzer bottle of club soda. Some women didn't leave home without their lipstick; I didn't leave home with my spritzer of club soda. To date, save for the white linen/bloody mary fiasco, I hadn't met a stain club soda couldn't tackle.

After spritzing, dabbing, and drying my dress under the hand dryers, I was good to go. Next time, I would kick the offending meathead boyfriend in the balls first and dodge the girlfriend and her drink later.

Before leaving the restroom, I did a once-over in the mirror. It always took me a few days to get used to my new look. Realizing the person staring back at me in the mirror wasn't a stranger, at least not in the traditional sense, took a few double takes.

The stylist had layered my hair with champagne and platinum highlights, woven in a few hair pieces for added length and va-va-voom, and added some long layers. Once the hair team was done, I'd been passed off to the waxer, the bronzer, the facial specialist, the manicurist, the pedicurist, and finally the girl who'd layered lash after precious fake eyelash into my existing ones. I didn't know what it was about that kind of Look at ME! style that men loved, but the ones I dealt with couldn't get enough. I felt more like a patina of a woman than a real one.

After making a slight dress adjustment, I headed for the door. The woman's lounge had been empty when I'd meandered into the restroom, but it wasn't anymore. In fact, the whole three's a crowd adage didn't seem to apply to the woman's lounge.

"And here I thought this was a woman's lounge," I said, startling two of the trio. The third couldn't have looked less startled. The dancer on her knees in front of Mr. Silva stopped pulling at his zipper, and the other, who'd been making out with him in a way that gave new meaning to the term "sucking face," gave the face sucking a break.

It wasn't an ideal first meeting: in the woman's lounge while the Target was about to be serviced by not one, but two, of his own employees. However, when G had warned me years ago to be prepared for anything, I'd taken that warning seriously.

I would take these three-way meet-and-greet lemons and make some goddamned lemonade.

Lowering my lids just enough, I gave Mr. Silva a hint of a smile. When his pupils dilated even more than they already were, I knew I'd caught his attention. The right attention. "I'll let you get back to it then." I headed toward the door, adding just a bit more sway of my h*ps to my step. "Have fun."

I hadn't gotten more than five feet when Mr. Silva's smile slid into place. "You can stay and play if you like," he said, letting his gaze linger on my chest for so long I was worried he would go cross-eyed. "The more the merrier." His voice was deep and smooth, and that confident expression was even more impressive in person than it had been in his photograph.

"I'll pass. Thanks though," I replied, as I lifted one eyebrow at him on my way to the door. "I don't do that. Anymore." I caught the look flash over his face before I unlocked the lounge room door to let myself out. That flash said I was the treat placed right under a child's nose they were told they couldn't have. Wanting what they couldn't, or thought they couldn't, have was every man's Achilles' heel.

I smiled my whole way out of the club. I was still smiling when I wandered into my hotel room a little while later. Despite the cluster-fuck of unexpected events, the Greet had been made of win. I'd caught Mr. Silva's attention, and I'd held his undivided attention while two half-naked girls were pressed up against him.

The job was going to be easier than I'd thought.

FAMOUS LAST WORDS. After five years, you would have thought I'd learned no job is ever easy. It's just not in the cards.

I returned to The Pleasure Room the following night, quite certain that if Mr. Silva caught sight of me, he'd drop anything and anyone and come my way. Again, that wasn't conceit talking; it was experience. The look on his face, the way he'd licked his lips as I passed him in the woman's lounge were strong indicators that what I was sending out, my Target was picking up.

I waited around until the club closed. Mr. Silva didn't show his face once, which seemed odd given it was Saturday night, The Pleasure Room was bustling, and Mr. Silva didn't seem as though he would ever willingly miss out on a party.

So back to the drawing board early Sunday morning. After thumbing through Mr. Silva's file again, I got into my car and zipped over to his country club. According to Mrs. Silva's notes, he went there every Sunday morning from seven to eleven a.m. Apparently, he soaked in the club's mineral pool before hitting the green for eighteen holes. I hoped Mrs. Silva's notes were "apparently" correct. Every hour wasted was one I'd never get back.

I pulled up to the club a half an hour before seven. The club, just like the spa where I'd met Mrs. Silva, only had valet parking. I'd had plenty of experience with those kinds of places. They didn't let just anyone off the street inside. You couldn't get inside the front door if you made less than seven figures a year. So how would I get past the front desk without so much as a second glance?

By pretending I owned the place, the way the rest of those upper-crust broads did.

These kinds of country clubs weren't the place where you scanned a membership card before being granted admission. Your membership card was the handbag on your arm, the name stamped on your shoes, the entitled tilt of your brow when you sashayed in.

I rolled my shoulders back as I walked through the front doors. I tipped the doorman and made it a good one, but I didn't make eye contact, and I didn't smile. The young woman attending the front desk glanced up as I passed her, but after a moment or two, she went back to her computer. And I was in. I'd just "snuck" into one of the most prestigious country clubs in the nation by doing what we Eves had mastered: hiding in plain sight.

The Louis Vuitton handbag on my arm, the Jimmy Choo's strapped onto my feet, and the rich-bitch expression I'd perfected didn't hurt either.

Other than the golf course, the club was pretty dead that early in the morning. When I found the mineral pool, not a single trust-fund soul was in sight. I couldn't have planned it more perfectly.

After tucking my purse, shoes, and dress into one of the pool decks' storage compartments, I gave the pool room one more scan. Empty, but not for long. I'd worn my swimsuit under my dress, so once I was certain I was alone, I gave the strings tied at my back and neck a tug.

I knew swimming topless to catch a guy's attention was classified as trashy by most non-European women. But since I didn't know anyone was coming soon-at least in Mr. Silva's estimation-my trashy ploy would be perceived as wild, spontaneous, and adventurous abandon.

Plus, Mr. Silva would see me half-naked, which would make him want to see me completely nak*d.

I didn't use this technique to lead into most of my jobs, but Mr. Silva was a bit more evasive than I'd anticipated, which meant it was time for the girls to come out to play.

The mineral pool area was beautiful, very Grecian inspired, and I wouldn't mind spending my retirement years in the pool itself. It wasn't quite hot-tub warm, but it was close, and millions of tiny bubbles gurgled through the water. I tilted my head back to wet my hair before swimming to the other end.

If it wasn't seven o'clock yet, it would be in the next minute. Mr. Silva was probably passing the front desk. Men like him hadn't built an enormously successful career for themselves by showing up late. Being prompt, even to their extracurricular activities, was ingrained in them.

I was just making the return trip when the door swung open. The pillars stationed around the pool deck obscured my view as I continued down the pool, but I heard a voice. Or voices. Only one of them was male. The other two were a couple of giggling girls.

If I had had something nearby to punch, I would have. Mr. Silva was turning out to be a major pain in my seducing ass. Mrs. Silva could have saved herself some money by having him followed for a day and snapping a picture of any one of the good handful of times he screwed another woman in any given week.

I'm sure if I had hidden and stayed quiet, I could have snapped a picture of him doing the deed-twice-in a few minutes, but that wasn't my job. The Eves didn't get paid for another woman screwing the Target. We didn't get the credit for another woman's hands-and-knees handiwork. So much for Mr. Silva's discretion.

I'd never met a Target less discreet.

I swam to the end of the pool, and by the time I'd almost reached the stairs, Mr. Silva and his giggling girls were in view. He had one on each arm. I almost rolled my eyes.

The two girls were different from the two in the woman's lounge, but they had the same look: blonde and busty with and had the fuck-me look on their faces. So what was my plan for getting and keeping his attention when I was blonde and busty like the other two?

I was going to give him the fuck-you expression.

The trio didn't notice me until I walked up the pool steps. When they did notice me, two sets of eyes narrowed. The third set widened.

The other girls might have been a bit bustier, but mine were real.

A girl with real boobs in Miami was harder to come by than a virgin wife.

"Sorry," I said to Mr. Silva, who was having a tough time making eye contact, "I thought I was alone."

When his eyes scanned my face, his smile tilted higher on one side. Oh, yeah. He remembered me. "And here I thought I was in the man's lounge."

I stared pointedly at the no-longer-giggling women. "Looks like you're outnumbered."

His gaze faltered again. "Lucky me."

I'd given him enough of the show for free. "I'll let you get back to it." I turned my back on the trio and wandered over to my stuff.

I smiled when I heard a couple of female grumbles. He was following me.

I acted surprised when he shouldered up beside me, of course. "What are you doing tonight?" he asked.

I couldn't even allow myself a small smile. I couldn't let him know I was pleased. I gave him another fuck-you face. "Not you, if that's what you're hoping."

"That wasn't what I asked." He leaned a shoulder into the wall as I slipped into my heels.

I glanced at his crotch, where something was prominently on display, and lifted an eyebrow.

He shrugged and didn't appear the least bit ashamed. "A beautiful woman with an equally beautiful rack is two feet in front of me. I'd be concerned if my johnson wasn't at full attention." That wasn't just full attention. That bulge was at holy-shit attention. "So, I'll repeat myself. What are you doing tonight?" If he stared at my boobs any longer, he would bust something.

That's exactly where I wanted him. Facing him, I gave him a better view for a split second before slipping my dress over my head. Puppy dogs couldn't look so sad. "Monogamy. That's what I'm planning on doing tonight. And tomorrow night. And the night after that. You should give it a try some time." I tossed my bikini top into my purse and gave him an expectant look.

"For a woman like you, I just might be tempted to," was his reply.

I'd never heard that line before ...

"If you ever find yourself so tempted one day," I said, passing him on my way to the door, "let me know."

I felt his eyes watching me intently, like a predator deciding just how to attack. The Mr. Silvas of the world didn't realize they weren't at the top of the food chain though.

I was.

"Daniel!" he called after me. "And I'll be letting you know soon!"

I shot a wave at the girls giving me impressive glares. This isn't the kiddie pool, girls. You're swimming with the sharks now. "Sienna," I replied over my shoulder, giving Daniel his first small smile. Women needed to better understand they couldn't give anything away for free when it came to a man, a smile included. He had to work for it, he had to earn it because ... he wanted to work for it, he needed to earn it. "And I won't hold my breath."

I walked out of the country club knowing I wouldn't have to look for Mr. Silva anymore. Daniel would come looking for me.

The Heat

I WAS LOUNGING on the balcony of my hotel room when one of my three cell phones rang. It was the G-designated one. She never just called to shoot the shit, so either something was very wrong or very right.

I answered the call and hoped for the best. "Bonjour, Madame G."

"Closed the Silva case yet?" was her warm greeting.

I smiled. If something was wrong, G would have gotten straight to it. She wouldn't have been making-at least, according to G-small talk.

"Almost," I replied.

"Almost as in sometime this week, or almost as in sometime this month?" G's voice could have been considered feminine if she didn't deliver each word as if it was a threat.

"Almost as in tomorrow night if I was confident Mrs. Silva could handle knowing I'd managed to seduce her husband in less than a few days. Out of respect for her, and because this guy is really a tool who deserves every bit of discomfort from the blue balls he'll get waiting for me, I'm going to wait a few more days to wrap things up." I sighed when I looked around at everything else I'd be wrapping up. Miami just a few minutes before sunset was like something from a dream. "Although I wouldn't mind it if you found me another case to work out here."

"Speaking of new cases ... guess who I got a call from this morning?"

My heart went into my throat. "Young, unhappy wife of an Eight, possibly a Nine, from Miami?"

"You're right except for the Miami part. She's from Seattle. She was just down in Miami for the weekend."

"And ...?" It would be a big job, and I wanted it.

"And if she decides to contract the Eves, you may end up with the job," she replied. "You know as well as I do that if I find another Eve's physical assets to be a better fit, you won't get the Errand."

I rolled my eyes only because G wasn't in front of me. If I ever tried that in front of her, I'd be the one found dead in a back alley a week later. "Come on, G. You know as well as I do I can transform myself into whatever version of a wet dream Mr. Eight or Nine needs. I want that Errand."

"Then let's hope Mr. MoneyBags likes a tall, slim, busty build because stylists and surgeons can morph you to a certain degree, but no one except for the Maker could turn you into a short, athletically-built Asian. Sorry, love." G didn't sound irritated, she rarely showed emotion, but I knew I'd be pressing my luck if I pushed again.

All I could do was hope the big Eight or Nine forthcoming was an aficionado to my brand of woman. Plenty of men were, but that didn't mean every man was. That didn't mean he would be.

"Anything else?" I asked, knowing there wasn't. G was all business, all the time. In fact, I didn't know a single personal thing about her, including her real name.

"Nothing else for now."

"Good night, G. I'll text you when it's done."

G chuckled a few notes. "And I'd say good luck if I thought you needed it."

After I hung up, I laid back down on the lounger to try to soak up the last few rays of sun. Not even a full minute later, a knock sounded on the door inside my room. No one knew I was there and I hadn't ordered room service, so I was tempted to grab the little Lady Smith I kept hidden in the nightstand for emergencies. After a quick look through the peephole, I saw I didn't need to answer with guns blazing.

I could have slid into a cover-up, but it was South Beach. People would have gone to work in their swimsuits if it was allowed. I swung the door open and tried not to smile when the bellman's mouth about dropped to the floor. I was only twenty-five, but I was only intimate with men ten, twenty, and sometimes even thirty years older than me. It was nice to be reminded I could turn the head of a guy my own age.

"Can I help you?" I asked after a few seconds.

The bellman shook his head a couple of times and picked his jaw up off the floor. "This was left for you at the front desk." He held out an envelope.

I gave it a curious look. G wouldn't leave me mail at the front desk and Mrs. Silva better not be, so who in the world would have left that for me? "Who left it?"

The bellman shrugged. "I don't know. My manager just asked me to run it up here."

I could stand there staring all day, or I could rip it open and unveil the mystery. Grabbing my wallet off of the desk, I tipped the bellman, thanked him, and closed the door.

I tore that sucker open quickly. The sooner I figured out who had sent it, the sooner I could figure out what the hell to do about it. Of all the things I imagined could be contained in that envelope-blackmail, photos, a microchip-the last thing I'd expected was a couple of tickets to Nice, France, complete with a note scratched down on the back of a business card.

In case the mood to swim topless strikes you again. I wouldn't want to miss it.

The business card said Daniel Silva, Owner and Manager of The Pleasure Room, complete with his business and cell phone numbers.

The first thing that hit me was that he'd been ballsy enough to send me his business card. I didn't doubt a simple "Daniel Silva" typed into a search engine would result in a life history, including a mention of a Mrs. Silva. So why had he done it? Because he didn't think I'd Google him? Because he wanted me to have his phone number? No, I guessed he wanted to impress me. A business card said what he couldn't without sounding like a pretentious a**hole. He was the owner of one of the nation's most notorious nightclubs. He had money, status, and power.

If Mr. Silva knew I already knew exactly how much was in his bank account, along with the balance in his offshore accounts, I doubted he'd send me tickets to the south of France.

The second thing that hit me was that, somehow, he'd figured out where I was staying. That was disturbing on a bunch of levels. He'd either had me followed, followed me himself, or had someone looking into me. I didn't like the idea of being looked into, especially when I was the one who was supposed to be doing the "looking into."

It wasn't the first over-the-top gift I'd had thrown at me, but it was the first time the Target had tracked me down and had it delivered to my room. Well, neither would do.

Ten minutes later, I'd changed, packed, and was at the front desk checking out.

"Is there anything else we can do for you, Miss Stevens?" the receptionist asked.

"Yeah." I handed her the envelope I'd addressed before leaving my room. It contained two tickets to Nice, along with my own note that read: In case the mood to try monogamy strikes you, here's my number. "Do you think a bellman would be up to hand delivering this if I gave him a nice tip?"

She inspected me purposefully before taking the letter. "I think the bellman would be up to hand delivering this if you asked one of them real nice and nothing else. But if you want to leave a tip, I'll make sure the bellman gets both."

"For the bellman,"-I slid a hundred dollar bill across the counter, and then one more-"and for you."

She was about to open her mouth when I cut her off. "I appreciate your help and hospitality." I headed out the doors before she could object, but I'm pretty sure I heard a few mumbled words of thanks.

I still wanted to be on the beach, but I wanted to put some distance between the last hotel and my new one. After circling Ocean Drive a couple of times, I settled on a quieter hotel that wasn't right in the middle of it all. It wasn't quite as luxurious as the last hotel, but the suite was bigger. Once I'd unpacked, I wandered into the bathroom to take a bath.

I avoided the full length mirror on the wall as well as the one over the sink. I knew that for most women, mirrors were either their best friends or their worst enemies, but for me, they were more like ghosts. I was conscious of them, but I did my best to ignore them.

I'd been soaking for all of five minutes before one of my phones chimed. I groaned, but I fumbled through my handbag until I found the ringing phone.

Shit. That was fast.

I took a moment to compose myself before answering. "Hello."

"I'm struck with monogamy."

Of course he was. Most men are struck with anything if you give them enough motivation.

"And why do I find that hard to believe?"

"Because you're you and I'm me," Daniel said. "That's why."

That was the first true thing I'd heard him say.

"I take it you're calling because you received my envelope."

"Those were first-class tickets, you know? A woman's a fool to turn those down."

"Or maybe you're the fool for giving them to a woman you barely know," I replied.

He didn't have an immediate response. "Maybe, but I feel a little foolish when I'm around you."

Good. Then I was doing my job.

"You act a little foolish when you're around me," I replied. Then, because the sooner I closed out the Silva file, the sooner I could be finished with the Mr. Silva, I turned the faucet on with my toe so water started trickling into the tub.

"Do you need any help?" he asked, his voice low and confident.

Cocky bastard.

"None that requires your assistance," I nearly snapped back.

"So what am I supposed to do now that I know, wherever you are right now, you're nak*d and probably soaping that beautiful body of yours?"

Add brazen to the cocky bastard lineup.

"Oh, I don't know. Why don't you go find one of those four girls I've seen you with over the past few days? I'm sure they've got something that could help you out."

Daniel chuckled. "They've got something that could help me out, but not the thing to help me out."

"If you hadn't tracked me down at my hotel to deliver airline tickets to Nice, I'd ask you who you think's got the thing to help you, but that would make me seem dumb or naive."

"Which you are neither," he answered.

"Flattery gets you nowhere with me."

"And honesty won't either."

Hmm.Another kernel of truth from the mouth of Daniel Silva. "I'm afraid you're right." I turned the water back off.

"Which is why I must have the opportunity to see if I'm wrong. Just in case. We owe it to ourselves."

"We owe what to ourselves?" I asked. I'd heard the answer to that question so many times, I could mouth it word for word before the Target even replied.

"To find out if the chemistry that sparks to life when I just look at you transfers into everything else."

Translation: I want to f**k you sideways, backward, frontward, and maybe even while you're running because I'm an impulsive little boy stuck in a man's body who never had anyone tell him no when he was growing up.

"What are you asking, Daniel?" I said with a sigh. "Because I'm not going to the French Riviera with you. I'm not really your south of France type of girl."

"Every girl is your south of France type of girl."

"Not this one. I think you'll find me different from every other girl you've ever known." He had no idea just how different. The wives knew about us Eves, but the husbands never did. Other than getting caught on camera with a siren they just couldn't say no to, the only thing they realized at the end of it all was that half of their fortune was leaving with their wife.

"So does different-from-every-other-girl Sienna want to have dinner with me tomorrow?" He still sounded pretty damn sure of himself, but not as much as he had in our earlier conversations. I had him back on his toes, following after that carrot I'd dangled just in front of his face. I could ease off of the hard-to-get act.

"If by dinner you mean food and a good bottle of wine and nothing more, then okay," I said.

Another silence on the other end, but it was quickly over. "Tomorrow night. Eight o'clock. I'll send a driver to pick you up."

"Since someone went all secret agent on me, I moved. You don't know where I am." I smiled. I loved it when I could stay not one, but two steps ahead of the Target.

"Sienna, I know exactly where you are. I know exactly when you checked in," he replied in a low voice. It wasn't creepy, just ... menacing. Dominant. "I even know what room you're in."

Just then, someone knocked on the door. I flinched, but I thankfully didn't make any audible noise.

"I'll see you tomorrow night," Daniel said before ending the call.

Another knock sounded before I'd crawled out of the tub and into a bathrobe. If that was Daniel on the other side of the door, I wouldn't be happy. I would be supremely pissed.

However, if that smug face of his was waiting for me, I couldn't do what a normal boy pursuing girl relationship allowed. I couldn't slap his cheek or yell at him to go get bent, because our relationship wasn't "normal." This wasn't a surreptitious man meets woman, woes woman, pisses woman off kind of thing. This was a job. I was an actor on a stage giving the performance of my life.

Still, I sighed with relief when I checked the peephole. Only a bellman. He'd better not have an envelope with a couple of first-class tickets to Tahiti in his hand or else I'd send them back, too.

"Good evening, ma'am," the elderly bellman greeted as he held out a large silver box.

Daniel was persistent. Most of them were. It made my job easier.

"Thank you." I took the package and set it on the sofa table before rushing back to the bathroom to pull a tip from my wallet. I was going through tip money faster than normal on that trip, thanks to Daniel and his extravagant gifts.

"Anything else I can get you this evening, ma'am?" the bellman asked, nodding his head as I handed him the tip.

"Yeah," I said. "If any more gifts, envelopes, or packages arrive for me, please just don't accept them. It saves me from having to send them back."

"Can do, ma'am," the bellman said with a chuckle as he headed for the elevator. "Man troubles?"

I lifted my eyebrows. "Always."

IT WAS A dress. A nice one. The price tag had been removed, but I didn't need it to know that Daniel had spent five figures. It was red, curve-hugging, and cl**vage-showing. Mrs. Silva really did know her husband. It was a gorgeous gown, something I could have picked out, but as I got ready the next night for our dinner date, it stayed in the box.

If I wore that dress, it would be a mini-surrender. It would be a victory, and I couldn't give him that victory yet. I had to keep him motivated, and if I caved even a bit, he would believe the ball was back in his court.

Which it wasn't.

With men like Daniel, I had to keep them in such a crazed state that when the time came, I could dictate the time and location of our "consummation," and they wouldn't only be there, they'd be there bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. Keeping the Target motivated, crazed, and eager to please was the very crux of the Eve business. Spontaneous sex or giving-yourself-to-the-moment didn't get husbands caught cheating on film.

A few minutes before eight, I punched a message into my phone: That whole if at first you don't succeed, try, try again doesn't work with me. As I hit send, I imagined Daniel's expression when he read it and allowed myself a smile.

I'd just slid into my heels and was heading for the door when his reply came: That's where your opinion and mine differ.

Cocky, cocky, cocky bastard. If he wasn't an Errand, I would never, in this life or the next, let him near me.

However, it was an Errand, so I needed to shelve all of my personal thoughts and feelings on him. An Eve didn't successfully close an Errand unless she checked personal at the door when she was working. And she didn't stay in the business for long if she didn't repress personal a good portion of the time when she wasn't on the job.

Once I'd made my way through the foyer, I found a black Bentley waiting for me outside. A driver waited with the back door open.

"I suppose you're waiting for me?" I said as I approached.

"I was told I'd be picking up a beautiful woman in a red dress," the driver replied, "but I'm sure Mr. Silva won't complain if I've got the wrong woman."

I gave him a smile as I slid inside of the car. "I'm sure he wouldn't."

Before the driver closed the door, he paused. "So, which one are you? The right or the wrong woman?"

I looked him in the eyes and answered, "Both."

"Sounds like Mr. Silva's a lucky man," he added with a laugh before closing the door.

In fact, Mr. Silva's luck was about to run out.

Not even ten minutes later, we pulled up to a familiar place. The line winding around the side wasn't as long as it had been on Friday night, but still, The Pleasure Room was busy.

I couldn't believe the son of a bitch had brought me there for a dinner date. He'd probably screwed a girl over every accommodating surface. I wasn't happy.

But tonight wasn't about being happy. It was about driving him mad so when I gave him the time and place of his forthcoming demise, he'd shake his head and wag his tail. Tonight wasn't about keeping him at arm's length anymore-tonight was about bringing him closer.

By the time the driver came around to open the door, I'd recomposed my face, adjusted my dress, and was ready to saunter into that place as though I might have wanted to be somewhere else, but not with anybody else.

The driver inclined his head at one of the giants hovering in front of the Pleasure Room's entrance. "Dimitri over there will take you to Mr. Silva."

"Thank you for the ride," I said.

"Glad I found the right-wrong woman," was his reply before climbing back into the driver's seat.

Dimitri had the rope open for me as I approached and gave me a professional nod of acknowledgement. From the way he'd barely looked at me, I guessed Daniel had threatened to cut off his dick if Dimitri made a pass at me.

He said, just as professionally, "Right this way."

"Lucky me," I said with a fake smile as I followed.

The Pleasure Room was just as busy as it had been this past weekend. Most of the bodies were congregated around the stage. One dancer in particular caught my attention. She was similar in appearance to myself, except her face looked foreign. Eastern European? Russian? Every girl up on that stage was gorgeous, but the way she moved, the way she danced made her the only one anyone noticed. She wasn't just a dancer; she was a performer. A quick scan of the crowd revealed I wasn't the only one who couldn't seem to look away. In the most heterosexual way, I was enamored by her.

She would have made one hell of an Eve.

"Who is that?" I hollered at Dimitri, who was parting the sea of people in front of us.

"Natasha," he said over his shoulder. He glanced up at the stage right as she started playing with the snap of her garter. He smiled while the rest of the crowd cheered their heads off. "She's something else, right?"

"She sure is," I agreed. That woman didn't just have everyone eating out of her hand. If she'd ordered them to jump off of a cliff, I didn't doubt a good number of them would. She was that hypnotic.

After we wove our way through the crowd, Dimitri shoved open a door to a staircase.

"No elevator?" I said, being difficult with him because I couldn't with Daniel.

"Not where we're going," Dimitri answered, motioning me up the staircase.

I almost wished I had let Mrs. Silva know tonight was the night and to have her Contact ready to go. I was getting dangerously close to being done in on Daniel's particular brand of bull shit.

My heels clacked up a few flights of the metal staircase. I glanced back to see if Dimitri was following, and sure enough, he was. As a testament to what a devoted employee Dimitri was, his eyes weren't locked on my ass as it swayed up the stairs. It was a good thing Dimitri wasn't the Errand, or I'd have had my work cut out for me.

Finally, the stairs ran out, and Dimitri stepped in front of me to shove open a heavy metal door. Where in the hell was I being taken? Romance had flown out the window a few flights ago. Once Dimitri moved to the side, I saw where I was: the roof. Several strings of white paper lanterns hung above us, and toward the edge of the roof sat a small table adorned with candles and flowers. The view was unparalleled. Nothing but the ocean as far as the eye could see, colored by the pinks and oranges of the sunset. The whole scene was romantic in a way I hadn't expected.

And then a body stepped into my line of sight.

Romance wasn't the job. Doing whatever it took to succeed was the job.

"Sir," Dimitri said formally, bowing his head.

"Thank you, Dimitri," Daniel said, "You can leave us alone. And if you hear a lot of shrieking and screaming later on, you can ignore it."

I made myself smile at him. I made myself flush with excitement. I made myself shut off my instincts and remember my training. In those moments, when I had to shut almost all of myself off, I always felt more machine than human.

After Dimitri had closed the door, I approached Daniel slowly. He was dressed to impress, and the man could certainly fill out a tuxedo. If he could keep his mouth shut, I might have found him attractive, but keeping his mouth shut, kind of like keeping his dick behind his zipper, wasn't his forte.

"I'm not sure whether to be incredibly angry or incredibly turned on that you're not wearing the dress I got you." His dark eyes gleamed as I moved closer. I hadn't chosen to wear the one he'd gotten me, but the black, beaded dress barely long enough to cover the bottom of my butt-cheeks wasn't a poor substitute. The twisted smile on his face confirmed that.

I knew what I needed to do. I knew I was at the point in the job where I stopped keeping him at arm's length and drew him in, but I found what I needed to do more difficult right then.

Difficult or not, I would do it. I didn't have a choice.

I continued forward until I was right in front of him. From the change in his expression, my proximity surprised him. Exactly what I needed. Play hard to get, keep them on their toes, then you've got them. It was a formula that worked for every man, everywhere.

Before he had a chance to say anything, I wrapped both arms around his neck, combed my fingers through his hair, and pressed my body against his. The moment still hadn't caught up with him, but it never took them long to catch up. When I crushed my mouth to his, he actually groaned. His arms wound around me until his hands grabbed any part of my hip or butt he could get a hold of.

I always removed myself from my body during physical encounters. It was the only way to preserve whatever sense of self I still had. It felt as if I was watching what was taking place, not actually experiencing it. Somehow, that made it easier.

When my tongue played with the opening of his mouth, his arms tightened around me, and he let out a low growl. I felt his length grow against my body, and that was my cue to back off. Tonight wasn't the night. Tonight was, appropriate given the location, the tease. It was a reminder of just how badly he wanted me. If a serious hard-on wasn't a reminder of what my body did to his, I would be unemployed in the morning.

Sucking his lower lip into my mouth-any kind of sucking drove most men up the wall-I slowly pulled back, releasing his lip and lowering my arms.

He was breathing heavily, his pupils were dilated, and from his expression, I didn't doubt he was seriously considering tossing everything off of the table before throwing me onto it.

"What in the hell was that?" Daniel asked as I moved toward the chairs at the table.

"That was a Hey, how are you doing? without using words," I answered, adjusting my dress where he'd rumpled it. I shot him a coy smile before sitting. "You like?"

Daniel lifted his eyebrows. "I like." He smoothed his hands down his tux, his breathing back to normal, before taking the seat across from me. "Is it too early in the date to ask when I get to experience the Hey, how are you doing? fuck?"

Charming to a flaw. Not.

"I'll save you the suspense and tell you now that you are not getting any kind of laid, screwed, or f**ked tonight," I said, leaning forward in my seat. "Now that that's out of the way, can we have dinner?"

"You're going to kiss me like that without so much as a Hello first, and then proceed to tell me we're not going to end up horizontal between the sheets tonight?" He sounded almost amused.

I lifted my eyebrows in answer.

"Cruel."

The door I'd just come through opened again, and a white-coated waiter approached.

"You really went all out tonight," I said. "Were you hoping to impress me or something?"

Daniel smiled into the night. "Or something," he said, "but since you've made it quite clear I'm not getting any tonight, I suppose I'll have to settle for impressing you." He leaned across the table. The candlelight cast stark shadows and highlights over his angular face. "So? Are you impressed?"

Two steps forward. One back. That was the theme of the tease. "I'm not sure yet. I'll let you know later."

Daniel exhaled, then glanced up at the silent waiter. "Bring Sienna a bottle of the Petrus."

"Actually, I'll take the Chateau Margaux," I said. "And I'll have a glass."

Daniel gave me a sheepish smirk. "You can't blame a guy for trying."

"Oldest trick in the book. And the most tired one as well."

"Thank you for the education," Daniel said before addressing the waiter. "I'll take a double scotch on the rocks."

Double scotch on the rocks. I could have called that from the moment I saw Daniel. If any man fit the double-scotch-on-the-rocks profile, he did. A man's drink of choice said a lot about him. It wasn't always accurate to the letter, but it gave an overall assessment. Double scotch on the rocks meant a man knew what he wanted, was used to getting it, and liked the finer things in life. He didn't hear the word no often, and when he did, he almost always turned it into a yes. I'd had my fair share of double-scotch-on-the-rocks Targets.

After the waiter left, I felt Daniel's eyes on me in that way again. In that predatory, stalking cat kind of way. If I hadn't been trained to the nines, that look would have made me squirm in my chair.

"So. The Pleasure Room," I said. "What got you into the pleasure business?"

Daniel shook his head once. "No. I don't want to talk about my backstory. Or yours."

Not a big surprise, but he was the first Target I'd had who put it out there like that.

"Why? Got your fair share of secrets and skeletons in the closet?" Of course he did. I already knew every last one of them.

"No one's gotten anywhere in life by dwelling on their past," he answered. "I certainly didn't get where I am by wallowing in the highs and lows of mine."

"So what? Do you want me to talk about my future? My goals? Dreams? Ambitions?" I said with a hint of sarcasm.

"No." Daniel gave his head another shake. "The future is for my investors and advisors. I want to talk about right now." His eyes slid down my neck, taking their time on my br**sts, before making the return journey. "I want to know what you want and how you want it."

I sucked in a breath. "And why do you want to know that?"

One side of Daniel's mouth curved up. "So I can give it to you."

He didn't even attempt to disguise his meaning.

The door whooshed open again as the waiter returned. Daniel's gaze didn't shift when the waiter placed our drinks in front of us. They didn't waver until long after the waiter had exited again. I didn't doubt that that kind of intensity had broken through plenty of women's defenses, but it wouldn't break through mine. Nothing he could send my way would break down my defenses.

"To the present," he said at last, lifting his glass toward me.

I raised my glass and tilted my head. "To getting what you want."

"How you want it," he added, before clinking his glass to mine.

We both took a long sip of our drinks. I knew how marvelous the wine was, I'd had it plenty of times before when I'd felt quite certain it alone could make me orgasm, but I barely tasted it. My mind needed to stay sharp, my body just as sharp. I couldn't let the wine mess with me.

"Why are you here right now?" he asked suddenly.

I swept my eyes around. "The view's hard to beat. And you look good in a tux."

"I know I'm not your first older man," he said, taking another sip of his scotch. He was right about that. "Unless you've been playing with the trust-fund Hampton boys, no girl your age knows what Chateau Marguex is unless she's been with her fair share of older, wealthy men."

I lifted a shoulder. "Those rich little Hampton boys only drink appletinis anyway."

"Why are you drawn to the older man then?" Daniel asked. as the waiter made his appearance again, setting a couple of wedge salads in front of us.

I met his stare. "Experience. And if they're single and older, that means they're not looking for commitment-which holds no interest for me-and they have fewer inhibitions."

"Fewer inhibitions in the bedroom?"

I shook my head before taking another sip of wine. "Fewer inhibitions in every room."

Daniel wet his lips as his expression darkened with desire. Rising from his seat, he approached me. His eyes never left mine until he rounded my chair. "Fewer inhibitions on rooftops, too," he said just outside my ear as his hands dropped to my shoulders. Daniel's hands were large, and even in that intimate touch, I knew he wanted me to feel the strength in them. He wanted me to feel his physical superiority. He wanted me to feel just enough helpless.

That might have worked if I hadn't put the whole series of events into motion in the first place. He was only there, touching me, because I'd orchestrated it.

His hands roamed down, thumbs skimming my collar bones, before they slid under my dress. I kept my breathing regular, I didn't shift in my seat, and I tilted my head back so he could see my feigned expression of pleasure.

"I knew they were real," he said, his voice rough. With his hands completely jammed inside of my dress, he took both of my br**sts in full handfuls before squeezing in a way that wasn't exactly gentle.

I removed myself a little bit more from my body and forced a soft moan to fall from my lips.

"I can't remember the last time I had my hands on a real set of tits." His thumb and finger captured my n**ples and rolled them so forcefully I almost faltered with my expression of ecstasy. Daniel liked it rough. I could tailor my final seduction the next night accordingly. "Oh, the fun I'm going to have with you tonight," he groaned.

When he shifted closer, I felt his erection hard against my shoulder. I guessed what he was hoping for next, but he could hope his way into a coma. He wasn't getting anything more from me tonight.

"Oh, the fun you can have with me tomorrow night." I bit my lip to keep from wincing when he flicked my nipple.

"That, too," he said, lowering his mouth to my neck.

I shook my head. "As in only tomorrow night." His mouth sucked at my neck as if he was trying to consume me. That would definitely leave some hickeys. Probably all part of his sick, staking-a-claim M.O. "I don't want to be f**ked on the roof of the building where you work. My high school boyfriend tried that, and it didn't turn out so well for him."

Daniel's mouth and hands slowed, but they didn't stop. Teenage Daniel hadn't taken no for an answer, and he'd evolved into a man who still hadn't learned the concept.

"Tell you what," I said, winding my arm around his neck. "You rent me the South Beach Suite at The Presidential tomorrow night and have a bottle of Cristal on ice, and I promise to make you feel so good, you'll be ruined for all other women." I was quiet after that, hoping he'd chase the carrot and give my sore n**ples and neck a break. Employing physical force to get the Target to stop was less than ideal. Had a way of ruining the romance I'd simulated.

"I'm already ruined for all other women," he whispered against my neck, tasting it one last time.

"Still struck monogamous?" I twisted in my seat and looked up at him. All the physical signs were there. All the responses I needed to know he was, for all intents and purposes, my slave. If I told him to get down on his knees and kiss my feet, I knew he'd do it.

He lifted an eyebrow in answer.

I smiled and stood up because my mouth was too close to his zipper, and Daniel wasn't ignorant of that nearness. "Of course you are," I said. Moving closer, I pressed a lingering kiss into the slope of his jaw before grabbing my clutch and heading for the door.

"We haven't even finished the first course yet," he said after me.

Oh, we've definitely finished the first course.

"I'm more of a main course kind of girl," I called back over my shoulder. "I've never been into the whole gradual progression thing."

Daniel's chuckle rumbled low in his chest. "You're leaving? You're really going to leave me like this?"

A person could be left like this in about a million ways, but if Daniel Silva was saying those words, there was only one way.

"Until tomorrow night."

"There is a way you could help me out, you know." Suggestion dripped from his voice. "A way that wouldn't technically qualify as me f**king you on the roof."

Optimistic, relentless bastard.

"Sorry," I said with a wave of my hand, "I never give head before I get it."

There was a few moments' pause while that settled in.

"You are the most intriguing creature I've come across," Daniel replied as I swung the door open.

"I know," I said to myself as I headed down the stairs.

The Sheets

DANIEL SILVA WAS getting nailed tonight.

In every way a man could. I'd done my job and done it well. Of course it would figure that when I'd finally landed in a city I could spend the rest of my life in, I moved the Target through the stages of seduction in next to record time. When the Target was a douchebag to Daniel's degree, I only took my time getting him into bed only out of respect for the wife. I could have been in his bed the night I'd met him, but timing was everything in my career. Just as taking too long was a detriment to wrapping the case up with a big bow, so was taking too little. Just under one week was a little fast, but still within the acceptable realm.

I'd texted G last night letting her know tonight was the night, and I'd texted Mrs. Silva the address, time, and suite of where Mr. Silva could be, literally, caught with his pants down. As long as she didn't drop the ball. Considering all of the intricate pieces to the game, making sure a P.I. or detective had a camera ready at a certain time was a preschool task. I'd never had a Client fail me, and if that day ever came, there'd be hell to pay. From G and me.

With most jobs, I'd take care selecting just the right lingerie. If the Target had suddenly grown a conscious, the lace, or the bustier, or whatever his preference in the unmentionables department was would send him over the unsure edge. Daniel Silva, though, wasn't in danger of growing a conscious. I could have showed up in a jumpsuit, and he would have been hard before I stepped inside the suite.

Since a particular shade or style of lingerie wasn't an issue, I went with none at all. Other than the red lace dress, that was short, tight, and off-the-shoulders, I wore nothing else. Well, I had some heels on, too. Having less to take off meant less actual time spent with Daniel Silva.

I knew hav**g s*x with a man I detested was a deplorable concept. I also knew if the Eves were ever made public, the scrutiny would be instant and overwhelming. But those who would turn their judgey little fingers our way wouldn't be the ones who knew how it felt to have your entire world crumble around you because of one man. They wouldn't know how it felt to invest your time and your dreams in one person only to discover they were f**king someone else behind your back. They wouldn't know the utter devastation of betrayal and the loss of self that ensued. They wouldn't know how our Clients felt knowing that freedom meant financial and social ruin. They wouldn't understand any of it.

And that was all right. Because I did.

I knew how it felt to have my whole life ruined because I'd been stupid enough to fall in love.

I knew. And I'd never forget.

As I punched the gas behind the wheel of the 640, I knew the Miami scene wasn't the only thing I'd miss. I was always assigned a sweet car, but this one was especially sweet. As much as I loved the car though, it wasn't worth spending another day with Daniel.

As I pulled up to the valet outside of The Presidential Hotel, I checked to make sure I was as removed from myself as possible. I needed to be sharp enough I didn't make a slip, but I had to remove myself enough that my actions wouldn't permanently taint my soul. I called it conscious removal, and to date, it hadn't done me wrong.

I barely noticed the lobby as I whisked through it because the lobby wasn't my destination. The South Beach Suite was. I'd chosen that suite instead of the presidential suite because it didn't require a special access key to get to the floor, which the Contact wouldn't have been able to get to. I always chose an accessible place that would provide the fewest number of road blocks. It wasn't my job to make the Contact's job easier, but it was my job to close the Errand, and I didn't want to give anyone an excuse for not holding up their end of the bargain.

Once I was inside of the elevator and going up, I checked my reflection in the gold doors. I'd lined and painted my lips red like I did on every Sheet night. Men were fixated on women's mouths, and when it was bright and hard to miss, the way mine was, they automatically imagined what it would look like wrapped around a certain part of their anatomy.

Red lips were what we called a natural aphrodisiac. Lingerie, cl**vage, stilettos, tiny and tight dresses, bedroom eyes, coy smiles ... all of those were natural aphrodisiacs. Unnatural aphrodisiacs had to do with chemical engineering. Certain drugs slipped into a drink could stimulate desire or, if need be, sleep. Liquids with precisely the right mix of pheromones could be dabbed on the neck or decolletage to lure a Target closer. The Eves arsenal had it all, but I was something of a purist. I'd never needed the assistance of chemical engineering to bed a Target, and my goal was to keep it that way.

I didn't consider it cheating; it just seemed like a cop out. The day I couldn't lure a man with nothing more than a look or bring him to his knees by sucking my lower lip into my mouth was the day I needed to start thinking about retirement.

The elevator doors whooshed open, announcing it was show time. I stepped into the hall and headed for the suite. There were only a few rooms on that floor, and it was mostly quiet, except for a couple of voices behind one door.

A male and a female voice coming from behind the door of the suite I was headed toward.

I cursed under my breath and started ad hoc'ing the hell out of my contingency plans. Maybe it was just a maid doing a turn-down service. Maybe a waitress was delivering the Cristal. Maybe it was no one of significance.

I sucked in a breath and knocked. The voices went silent right before the door swung open. Daniel was in a dark suit, smiling at me with expectation, and a familiar woman came up behind him.

It was the show-stopping burlesque dancer from last night.

Fuck.

"Daniel," I said cooly, giving Natasha just as cool of a look. No one had said anything yet, so I didn't technically know why she was there, but from her clothes-almost identical to mine except her dress was black-and Daniel's already rumpled tie, I knew why she was there.

That cheating, three-way bastard was going down, and knowing I'd be responsible for it felt like a privilege.

"We've been waiting for you," he said with a smug expression. "I thought we could use a little company on our big night." He inclined his head back at Natasha, who was smiling at me as though I was more her type than Daniel.

If I ever ran into Mrs. Silva again, I would give her hell for not documenting that her husband was so into three-ways he probably couldn't get off anymore without two girls grinding all over him.

"And I thought I told you that I didn't do that." I propped a hand on my hip and gave him a killer look.

"Anymore," he added. "You said you didn't do that anymore. But tonight's going to change that."

He reached for my waist and pulled me inside. I would have fought if I thought I could succeed. Knowing when to fight and when not to was an important part of our world. Daniel had me when it came to brute strength. I'd lose any and all physical battles against him. My strength came from my words, and I'd battle him with those until I'd won.

Daniel picked up a glass of champagne and handed it to me. If he thought this was my celebration face, he had another thing coming.

I crossed my arms and narrowed my eyes. "Either she goes or I go."

Natasha crossed her arms, too. No offense to her, because if I batted for the other team, I'm sure she'd do it for me, but Natasha and female f**kery wasn't part of the job.

Daniel firmly shook his head. "No. Nobody is going. We're all going to get nak*d, play with each other, and f**k like it's going out of style." With those ever so eloquent words, he lifted the glass of champagne I'd refused and drained it in one long drink. "Any questions?"

I took one full breath before I chanced responding. I wouldn't have been able to stay civil if I hadn't given myself a few moments to bite back the words that wanted to fly out of my mouth. "She goes. Or I go."

Daniel's forehead wrinkled. Setting the glass back down, he approached me. He wound his arm around my waist and shoved me hard against him. His mouth moved just outside of my ear, and he held me like that for a while before he said anything. It was a play to intimidate me.

I couldn't be intimidated, least of all by someone like him. Behind the expensive suit and the insatiable sex drive was a little boy who'd wet the bed and grown up ignored by his mother. G hadn't been remiss when she'd included psychological training in the Eve line-up.

"I know how bad you want me. I know you want me so bad you'd be willing to do anything," he breathed into my ear, pulling me harder to him. "You want me? This is the price."

I lifted an eyebrow and gave him an unimpressed smile. "I know how bad you want me. I know you want me so bad you'd be willing to do anything. You want me? She goes," I said, not blinking as I met his stare. "This is the price."

"You're bluffing." His eyes flashed with excitement. From his expression and his stiff member pressed into my hip, a woman talking back to him was obviously turning him on. The majority of my Targets were the same.

"I never bluff when it comes to sex," was my reply. When his hold on me loosened just enough, I wove out of it and headed for the door.

Yes, I was bluffing. Tonight was the night, and come hell or three-way high water, I needed to get Mr. Silva's pants around his ankles. I was playing a hunch that he wouldn't let me get past the door. I didn't want to think about the repercussions if that hunch blew up in my face.

I was about to step my first foot out into the hall when his hand grabbed mine. He gave it a tug and whipped me back inside of the room. "Natasha. Leave," he ordered, inclining his head toward the door.

"Excuse me?" Natasha replied in an outraged tone with a thick European accent.

"Precisely." Daniel threw her an irritated look. "You're excused."

She made a disgusted noise before grabbing her purse and storming for the door. "Un-f**king-believable," she said, glaring at him in a way that gave new meaning to the term glaring daggers. "When you're finished with him trying and failing to satisfy you, come find me," Natasha said, dropping her hand on my arm. "A woman knows what a woman wants." Then, she blew me an air kiss, flashed her middle finger in Daniel's face, and marched out into the hallway.

Daniel slammed the door. "Alone at last. I hope you're happy," he said, giving me an expectant look. "You'd better make this good."

One hurdle down, one more to go. Fifteen minutes to go, and I'd never have to see Daniel Silva again. Ten if I moved fast. "If you didn't believe I would, you wouldn't have kicked her out."

Daniel's face shifted into a smirk. "True. So show me just how good you are."

Planning on it.

When he stopped in front of me, I moved for his zipper. I gave it a hard tug, eliciting a surprised exhalation from him, followed by a grin. He didn't want to waste time either.

I slid my hand inside of his pants until I had a firm grip on him. His chest was rising and falling before I did anything else. I lowered my grip down him, swiveling and tightening, before gliding back up in a quicker, looser motion. When I repeated the motion, a deep groan vibrated up Daniel's chest. After two more pumps, his pupils were dilated, and his face was lined in a familiar way. When I swiveled down again, I rested a couple of fingers lower. From the feel of it, he was about to come in my hand.

I knew how to touch a man to make him fall apart in less than ten seconds, but I hadn't been employing anywhere near my A-game with Daniel. Somebody had an issue with premature ejaculation, which actually fit with what I knew of him.

"How's that for good?" I whispered as I freed my hand.

"Damn," he breathed, giving his head a clearing shake. "Where did you learn that?"

"My sorority back in college. There was a competition to see which sorority gave the best handjobs, and we took the challenge seriously." I lied, since the truth would have ruined the whole mood.

"Obviously. Any other skills you picked up in college I might be interested in?" From the look on his face, he was about to throw me down on the carpet right then and there. That wouldn't work.

I pointed with my eyes at the dark bedroom behind him. "Why don't you go strip down, lie down, and I'll give you a live demonstration?"

"My God," he said, already yanking on his tie, "I've never wanted a woman more than I want you."

What a compliment (insert sarcasm here).

Once he'd disappeared into the bedroom, I rushed to the door, unlocked it, and opened it just a hair. After a quick time check, I allowed myself a smile. I'd timed it almost to the minute. If someone wasn't waiting out in the hall, the night would be all for nothing.

As I headed for the bedroom, I grabbed my clutch and unsnapped it. My eyes took a moment to adjust to the darkness, but when they did, I found an eager, very eager, and nak*d Daniel Silva spread out on the bed. There was no denying he had a nice body, but even though the exterior was beautiful, the interior wasn't. It was ugly, and knowing that made enjoying the exterior impossible.

"Well, here I am," he said, motioning down at his torso. "Ready and rock hard. Why don't you get over here and help me out with that?"

I reached for the zipper at the back of my dress and lowered it. Daniel leaned up on his elbows, his eyes flashing. Sliding each arm out, I shimmied the dress down my chest and over my h*ps until it was rumpled in a heap on the floor.

"There's a special place in heaven for women who don't wear underwear," he said, wetting his lips as his eyes skimmed me.

I raised an eyebrow at him. "And there's a special place in hell for the men that f**k with them."

He grabbed a condom off of the nightstand, tore the package open, and rolled the condom down his length as though he'd done it a million times. He probably had. "Since it doesn't sound like you and I will spend our hereafters in the same place, we'd better make up for it right now."

I crawled up the bed toward him. "No more talking," I ordered, straddling him until I felt his dick twitching below me. "Just screwing."

"With a mouth like that, I'd rather have you talk dirty the whole time," he said as his hands affixed to my hips. He tried to lower my body over him, but I didn't let him. Maintaining control was the only way I managed to get through it.

Reaching for my clutch at the foot of the bed, I slid the silk scarf out. Daniel froze for a moment when I held it in front of his face, so I lowered myself until I felt him just barely inside of me.

A rush of air escaped his lips.

"It will make what I'm about to do to you more intense," I whispered as I wrapped the dark scarf around his eyes. Plus, it makes it impossible for you to see a camera flash go off from the other room.

He shook his head as I tied a knot at the back of it. "No. I want to see you. I want to see those f**king perfect tits bouncing."

He was fighting it more than the others. I didn't blindfold every Target, circumstance didn't always require it, but I couldn't risk Daniel seeing anything, or anyone.

Emptying my mind, I lowered the rest of the way onto him. Whatever protest was on Daniel's lips was lost when I arched my back and slid back up his length.

"Convinced?" I whispered outside of his ear as I lowered myself again, agonizingly slow.

Daniel was mid-growl when I detected the slightest noise from the sitting room. I checked our angle to make sure the camera would catch Daniel's face and exactly what we were doing before I moved up and down him in deep, quick spurts.

He was past the point of words. I'd never known a man who wasn't when an Eve was astride him and implementing everything she'd learned. Words were for men whose women didn't know how to send them over the edge in one precise thrust.

Daniel's hands roamed up my body until they gripped my shoulders. Bracing himself, he pounded harder as he bent me forward. He might have been blindfolded, but he had no problem finding my nipple. Sucking it hard, his tongue played with it, circling and teasing until I had a sudden flash of pleasure.

And then the man moving below me, moving inside of me wasn't Daniel Silva. A different mouth was tasting me, different arms were holding me tight, a different body was taking and having mine.

When I realized whose face I was visualizing, I cried out. Daniel misunderstood my cries because his pace picked up yet again. When his teeth sunk into my nipple, I cried out again, willing my mind to empty. I hadn't let him inside of my defenses in so long. It had been so long I'd almost forgotten the way his touch felt.

It hadn't been long enough.

When Daniel's mouth moved just outside of my ear, his breath impossibly fast as it kept pace with his thrusting, I involuntarily replaced his sounds with another's. He'd sounded so similar, that low, vibrating rattle in his chest when he was ready to fall apart in my arms.

I whimpered again right before Daniel hit his cli**x. Now this, the rutting and deep growl wasn't the same. His was different enough for me to shove that face out of my head and remember who I was with and what I was doing. Never before when I'd emptied my head had that face from my past found its way into the vacancy, but after it had, I was terrified it would happen again. I couldn't allow that. I'd rather be present and feeling and experiencing everything with the Target than have a replay of what had just happened.

As the aftershocks of his orgasm ripped through Daniel's body, his arms fell to the sides. That was also different, making resurfacing from the nightmare I'd just found myself in easier. The arms from my past would hold me tight and never let go until both of us had fallen into a deep, satisfied sleep.

"You are good," he said between short breaths. "In fact, the best f**k I've ever had."

That's because I was trained by the best.

"I'd give my whole fortune for that kind of a screw," he said.

You only have to give half. What a bargain.

I checked over my shoulder to make sure it was all clear before untying the blindfold. Daniel blinked a few times as an ear-to-ear grin settled on his face.

"Did you get off, babe?"

I smiled to myself as I climbed off of him and the bed. I zipped into my dress, slid into my heels, and stuffed the blindfold back into my clutch as quickly as he'd rolled on a condom. He was an expert at getting off; I was an expert at getting up and getting out.

I examined him spread out and spent on the bed. Thirty seconds after orgasm, and he was still hard. "Oh, believe me, I got off big time. Babe," I tacked on.

As I headed out of the room, he said, "So, I'll see you around?"

I rolled my eyes. The same line guys used in high school was just as overused twenty years later. "Oh, I'm sure you'll be seeing plenty of me around in the future."

Also known as blown-up black and white photos on display in divorce court. Time to figure out how to do more with less, Mr. Silva, because your wife's about to take you to the bank.

Before I headed out of the door, I grabbed my wayfarers from my clutch and slid them into position. That was my post-game tradition. My victory dance. I slid those glasses on, and I was someone else. A girl who didn't just sleep with husbands because their wives commissioned her to. I was a girl setting another girl free. I was a girl channeling my need for revenge on a worthy cause. I was a girl who'd closed an Errand and was that much closer to my own freedom.

The Sweet

IF I COULD give an accurate snapshot of a man based on his drink, what did mine say about me?

I slid onto the barstool of some crummy bar a few blocks off the beach and ignored the way the bartender eyed me. "Give me a shot of the cheapest stuff you have on the shelf."

The bartender gave me a funny look and took a second glance at my designer clutch, then my dime-sized diamond studs. I gave him a look even though he couldn't see my eyes behind my sunglasses. "Glass," I said, pointing at the tower of them behind him. "Bottle." I waved my finger around the large jugs on the bottom shelf, guessing those were as cheap as cheap got. "Pour." I mimed it for him. He still wasn't moving. "Questions?"

Finally, muscled, shaved-head meathead with a shirt so tight I guessed it cut off the circulation to his brain chuckled. "You didn't say the magic word."

Did every man on the face of the planet have to be a total dickhead? In my line of work, you didn't ask that question unless you wanted to find yourself on an impressive cocktail of anti-depressants.

"Please," I said, giving him another Get a move on wave.

After he'd poured a shot from one of those giant-sized jugs, he dropped it in front of me. I slid a twenty out of my purse and gave it to him. "Thanks for the stellar service."

He chuckled again, leaned into the counter, and looked like he was about to say something when my phone went off. I'd already destroyed the Client and Target phones, so only one person could be calling me.

I moved the phone to my ear and gave the bartender an expectant look. I waited until he'd moved on to another single girl on the opposite end of the bar before answering.

"No need for an actual verbal congratulations," I said, wrapping my hand around the shot glass. "Your standard G reply says it all." I'd texted G and Mrs. Silva the V for victory message a little earlier. Other than her usual G reply to confirm she'd received my text, I never heard from her. I never heard from her unless ...

"You've got another Errand for me," I stated, about to grimace before catching myself. "Need I remind you I just finished a big, fat Eight about thirty minutes ago? I think that's earned me a day or, Lord have mercy, a weekend reprieve." I was pressing my luck with G, but I was exhausted. Physically and mentally. We Eves generally got a few weeks off between each Errand for a reason. We needed time to rest and clear our heads before we walked into another one. After Mr. Silva's particular breed of swine, I needed a long reprieve.

"This isn't just another Errand." G's voice sounded almost ... excited. G did excitement about as often as I did. Every other year. We penciled it into our calendars and everything. "This is the Errand."

My heart stopped. "You convinced my spa girl to let us help?" If G was calling to tell me that, I was getting the Errand.

"Convinced? She didn't need any convincing after I explained how we worked."

"I'm getting the Errand?" I felt refreshed and ready to go at the very thought of landing that one. The payout would bolster my bank account enough so that, if I kept at it for another year or so, I could be out. Retired, fully funded, doing what I wanted, and answering to no one.

"From the Client's description of her husband's ideal woman, she could have been describing you the day I found you at that mall moping and alone."

That memory made me flinch, but it passed quickly. "How much? What's he worth?" I crossed my fingers, legs, and toes.

"It's our Ten," she said slowly. "It's the one we've been waiting for."

The air rushed out of my lungs. Scratch that whole year of work forecast. Successfully completing that Errand meant my personal freedom one second after texting G the V message. I could be in my own personal paradise, soaking up sun and scuba diving, in a month.

"Holy shit," I breathed, incapable of anything else.

"Well put. So eloquent," G replied. "Let's hope you remember your manners and your class when you get to the Greet with Mr. Ten."

"You tell me when and where, and I'll be whatever that Ten needs me to be."

"There's the Eve I trained." I could almost hear the hint of a smile in G's voice. "I hope you don't have big plans because the Client is about to board a plane as we speak. She was in Miami for another long weekend, but she's got the file if you think you can make it to Miami International in under an hour."

"I'll be there." I popped off of the stool and grabbed my clutch. "Text me exactly where I'm meeting her, and I'll be there in forty-five."

"I will. And good luck."

My eyebrows came together. Had I heard her right? We Eves didn't believe in luck; we created it. "I don't need luck, G."

G inhaled slowly on the other end. "For this one, you might. Now hurry up. There's a reason I supply you with a fast car, you know."

"Hurrying up," I said, ending the call. I rushed toward the exit before I caught myself. Lunging back to the bar, I grabbed the shot, upended it, fought the cringe-shiver off, then slammed the glass upside-down on the counter. It was a habit I wished I could give up, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't not celebrate a victory with a cheap shot in a cheap bar. Maybe one day, but not this one.

Once I'd hurried out of the bar, I rushed to the 640. This kind of joint didn't offer valet. I kicked off my heels when I slid into the seat, and the engine had barely turned over before I'd put the pedal to the metal. I flew down Ocean Drive, weaving in and out of cars and dodging pedestrians. When I sped past a familiar building with a long line outside its entrance, I put my arm outside the window and raised my middle finger into the air.

Farewell to The Pleasure Room and Mr. Daniel Silva. Hello, Mr. Ten.

Once I hit the Causeway, I set the 640 loose. Since it was late, traffic wasn't much of an issue. I left the lights and glitter of South Beach behind me. It was something to miss, a place to mourn, but what I was heading toward made the goodbye easier.

I cruised into MIA twenty minutes later. I whipped into the closest parking spot I could find, and once I'd slid back into my heels and grabbed my clutch, I flat-out ran for the terminal. I still had on the red dress from earlier, and even though it was short, it was so tight it made running impossible. Once I'd jacked it up a few more inches, I could finally sprint. I turned more than a few heads, but now wasn't the time to be concerned with appearances.

My phone pinged. Fumbling through my clutch, I pulled it out, checking the time first. Thirty minutes down. The women's restroom just outside of security in the North terminal.

When I realized I was already in the right terminal for the Meet, I almost wondered if luck was shining down on me. I dismissed that idea before it could take root. Luck was a concept created by people too weak or afraid to take control of their lives or circumstances. At least that's what G had drilled into me. I believed it.

Scanning the terminal, I caught sight of the little blue sign with a woman figure stenciled into it a few hundred feet down. I didn't sprint the distance, but I power-walked. I wouldn't get this close only to fail in the eleventh hour.

I took a moment to recompose myself before I shoved through the women's restroom door. I smoothed my hair and dress before rolling my shoulders back and lifting my chin a touch. Confidence just a notch below arrogance. That was how we were instructed to come to the Meet.

The bathroom was quiet and appeared empty. Just before I cursed myself for being too late, a figure walked out of the end stall.

"Fancy seeing you again," Mrs. Ten said, giving me a quick once-over before pulling a thick folder out of her carry-on. She was the first Client I'd had whose voice wasn't shaky. "G said you were her best. I hope she's right."

Mrs. Ten was a bitch. I hadn't picked up on that at the spa.

Fine. I'd see her bitch and raise her a raging one. Crossing my arms, I held out my hand as she approached. "I am."

She dropped the file into my hand and gave me a condescending smile. "There it is. Everything you need to know to nail my husband." Her smile twisted higher as she studied the folder. "If you need any tips on how to fake orgasm when you're with him, give me a ring. I'm the expert."

That reminded me of something. "I'll mail you a phone just as soon-"

She lifted her hand. "No need. G's already equipped me, gone over the rules. And gone over the rules again. My lips are sealed, and I will be waiting on the edge of my seat for you to text me that final V."

I didn't know how or when G had worked everything out, but I didn't mind. It saved me having to spend another ten minutes with the bitch queen.

"Now, if we're done here, I've got a flight to catch."

Nice to be working with you, too, I mouthed once she'd passed me.

"Question," I said, spinning on my heels. "Why do you want out?" The answer to my question was somewhere in the file in my hands, but I had to know right now.

Her face shaded for a split second.

"He's a cheating a**hole," I said, more of a statement than a guess. I knew that look. Hell, I'd lived that looked for a couple of months before G found me.

Mrs. Ten shook her head. "He's made his billions. I've done my time. I want out. And I want my share." One corner of her mouth twitched up.

I took an automatic step back. That wasn't how it worked. I'd never heard of an Errand without a good-for-nothing cheater or beater as the Target. It was an unsaid maxim we Eves held to. It made our jobs easier to know we were nailing a bastard who deserved it. From the sound of it, Mr. Ten had committed no greater offense than making a shitload of money and marrying the wrong woman.

"You've got a husband to screw, and I've got a flight to catch," she said, shoving through the door. "Good luck."

There was that word again: luck. I'd disliked hearing it once in reference to an Errand. I positively abhorred hearing it twice.

Backing up into the sink behind me, I contemplated my moral dilemma. I'd just wound up with the largest Errand in the history of the Eves. The payout would set me free. It was the Errand we dreamed of, the one we spent our careers chasing. And I had it in my hands.

In the other corner ... the Client had commissioned us for no reason other than she was tired of the mister in her life. She didn't want a divorce because he was screwing half of Texas or because he liked to beat her into next week. She was leaving him because she could and, with the Eves' help, she could with billions to her name. I had something of a skewed sense of right and wrong, and even I knew that was f**ked up.

What would I do? Could I take this one? Would my conscience allow it?

Those were questions I couldn't answer. One half of me answered them one way, and the other half answered them the other way. I was at a stand-still.

Before I knew what I was doing, I opened the file and slid the mass of paperwork out. Maybe once I'd read through some of the notes, seen some of the answers, I could make up my mind. I knew if I declined the Errand, G would want to rip my heart from my chest with her own hands. Hell, I'd want to do the same to myself if I turned it down.

I quickly scanned the first few pages. My hands actually shook as I read. Nothing stood out. Nothing gave away that Mr. Ten was a Grade A loser who needed to be brought to his financial knees.

Nothing.

From the list of charities he was involved in, the man seemed as if he would qualify for sainthood when he passed on.

And then I flipped to the next page. My hands went from trembling to shaking. My knees gave out, and had it not been for the sink behind me, I would have crashed to the ground.

I stared at the photo of Mr. Ten. I stared at a familiar face. I stared at the face of the man I'd unwillingly imagined when I'd been with Mr. Silva.

I stared at the face of the man I'd loved. The same man who'd brought me to my own knees and taken every scrap of confidence I'd possessed five years ago.

By the time I'd caught my breath and calmed the shaking, my mind was made up. I was taking the Errand. I wouldn't only take it, I would ruin him the way he'd ruined me.

I would no longer have to exact my revenge on the lovers of other women-I could focus it on the one who deserved it all.

I wandered out of the bathroom a few minutes later, the file tucked under my arm, and I headed for the ticket counter. Goodbye, Miami. Hello, Seattle.

I was resolved. I was ready. I would make him feel every last drop of devastation I had.

Because I was in the business of Great Exploitations. And business was good.

END
