Chapter one

Standing atop a lonely hill, Vivian gazed out upon the turbulent sea. Voluptuous and shapely, she cut a striking silhouette. Resembling the siren she was purported to be, she looked to the west. A dark ship appeared on the horizon, and with its sighting, her pulse quickened. Was it the dark pirate captain who haunted her dreams? A tall and fierce warrior, his face was full of fury. And passion. With just a glance from him, her loins quivered. With a touch ... implosion.

Was it he? Returning from faraway lands and adventures she could only dream of, would he pillage and plunder her body as only he could? Would the pirate bestow upon her the treasure of his manhood? Or would he cast her aside as an empty booty?

Would he?

Would he?

Would he care for another Diet Dr Pepper?

Wait, what?

I was torn from my pirate fantasy by the nasal, weenie voice of Richard Harrison, CPA.

"Can I get another Diet Dr Pepper, please? And for the lady, another-what was it you're having, Viv?"

"Scotch. Water. Neat," I answered, looking across the table at the latest in a long line of blind dates. Set up by my mother, which should have been my first clue to say no and run screaming into that good night. Not that she didn't have good taste; she'd picked a looker with Richard. Strike that-he was a looker if that's what you were into.

Brown hair. Brown eyes. Brown chinos, perfectly creased. White button-down. White teeth. Blindingly white, actually; I was pretty sure when he smiled chimes went off. Every time a CPA smiled, a fairy got its wings?

Jesus, Viv, get a grip.

I sipped my Scotch, wincing not only at the good burn, but at the bad turn this conversation was taking. Tax laws over appetizers. Nothing like a little burrata caprese with a side of capital gains.

I'd gotten through the first twenty minutes of Current Bad Date by letting my mind wander to my favorite place, Romance Novel Central. But now even the thought of pirates marauding through my underwear couldn't spare me from the drone of brown-brown-brown-white-white-boring.

I let my eyes wander around the restaurant, fingering the small locket around my neck. Shell-pink and ivory, the tiny cameo had been given to me when I was thirteen. A family heirloom, it had been given to me as a confirmation gift. My family was still active in the church; not so much me. Although I did love a good fish fry. With a side of guilt, thank you very much. Which was why I was here on a Friday night instead of relaxing with a good book.

Directly above my heirloom cameo was a face "framed by wisps of dark curly hair, with golden tanned skin, and sea-glass-green eyes." This is how my mother sold me to Richard Harrison, CPA, and aforementioned weenie. I did in fact have dark curly hair, all two inches of it, and I did have green eyes. Golden skin? Well, it was tan, I'll give her that. But what she neglected to mention was the barbell in my left eyebrow. She usually also left out the nose piercing, tongue piercing, and the tattoo at the base of my neck. When I took off my leather jacket earlier, it made Mr. Harrison cringe a bit, but he held his own. Barely five two in socks but almost five four in my favorite combat boots, I knew very well the image I was projecting-certainly one at odds with the familyfriendly TGI McGeneric restaurant he'd brought me to. All the great restaurants in South Philadelphia, and he brings me here?

Why in the world did I let myself get talked into another blind date?

Because you're single, you've never been in love, and you're Desperately Seeking Pirate?

True. I'd also take a cowboy. Or a fireman. Or an estranged prince separated from his royal bloodline by a ruthless uncle hell-bent on obtaining the throne, especially when it came along with the maiden princess from a rival kingdom, the most beautiful creature in all the land. Too bad for the uncle that the maiden had been de-maidened by said prince on a bed of snowy-white down feathers. And when the prince thrust into his lady love, her nails scored into his back like those of an eagle taking flight, a flight into passionate-

Whoa. No more Scotch.

Ten solid minutes later of listening to him wax poetic about tax shelters and Roth IRAs, I set my glass down and stared at him. I could be luxuriating in a bubble bath and inside my head with the pirate king, but I was listening to this? I was perfectly capable of finding my own dates, a fact I lectured my mother about over and over again. Though actually putting this capability into practice was a different matter; a practice I didn't really engage in. It wasn't that I wasn't interested in dating; I was. To a point. I just didn't have any patience for the small-talk two-step that one needed to engage in to catch a feller.

I knew that life couldn't be like a romance novel, where someone could fall hopelessly in love with her soul mate the moment they met eyes across a crowded room.

Preposterous.

Or that you could be whisked off into a world of fantasy and excitement by a handsome stranger, instantly connect, and be in perfect sexual sync from the second his mammoth male member teased your delicate flower petals.

The idea.

Or that there was a billionaire bad boy at the head of every Fortune 100 company who was in his late twenties, six feet, three inches of barely tamed unchecked male aggression who was waiting for a tiny waif of a girl with no self-esteem and Chuck Taylor sneakers with no socks to knock him off his pedestal and change the course of his life over a two-martini lunch and a quickie in the restaurant ladies' room.

For the record? Wearing Chucks with no socks makes your feet stink like bags of disgusting.

However. For all the ridiculous perpetuated in a romance novel, I still longed for the fantasy. The fairy tale. The wonderful give and take that occurred when two became one. So I went out on dates, met guys in bars, picked them up occasionally, and had the mostly bland, occasionally inventive, sex of the single-girl encounters. Orgasms, whether by my own hand or someone else's, could never be discounted. So when my mother wore me down every few months about being the only one of my siblings who wasn't married, I relented and let her set me up on blind dates.

My type and my mother's type were as different as tuna fish and a curling iron. I liked a bad boy, and had enjoyed some a time or two. I preferred them a bit rough, tough looking. Messy hair? Yes, please. Artistic? Yes, please-musician, painter, performance artist, what have you.

My mother's type was everyone's type: good provider, steady, accomplished, smart, sociable at parties, and enough sperm to breed Catholic guilt into the next generation several times over.

And in this latest surge of motherly influence, no doubt spawned by the birth of her third grandchild and her wild desire to have a baker's dozen, lately she had been setting up dates for me like it was going out of style. In the last two weeks alone I'd been out with Harry Thomson, Tommy Dickerson, and now Richard Harrison. A financial planner, a tax lawyer, and now a CPA. Same guy, same pants, same brain. Tom, Dick, and Harry? Oh hell, no ...

"So I said to the guy, if you want to roll over all of this into a 401(k) I'll do that, but you'd miss out on the more attractive shelter over here! So what I proposed was-"

"Dick? Can I call you Dick?"

"Actually, I'd prefer Richard, but-"

"Dick, I'm going to stop you right here. This was a mistake."

He looked crestfallen. "Darn it all, I knew we should have ordered the chicken fingers. This berretta cheese is a little too exotic for my taste too. Let me see if I can get our waitress and-"

He held up his hand for some help with his "berretta," and I slapped mine on the table.

"It's not the cheese, it's not the restaurant, it's not even you, Dick. It's me. I should never have let my mother talk me into this."

"Your mother is terrific. Great assets."

"No more asset talk. I want to be romanced; I want to be swept away-I want something special, rare, passionate, out of the ordinary!" I replied, my voice rising as I got worked up. I leaned across the table. "I want someone who will sweep everything off the table, throw me across it, and ravage me to within an inch of my life. Can you do that, Dick?" I slammed down the rest of my Scotch, meeting his eyes in challenge.

"Passionate? Out of the ordinary?" He gulped, pulling at his tie. Then a strange look came over his face. "You mean like, in the butt?" he whispered with an exaggerated wink.

Oh. My. God.

"How we doing over here?" a cheerful voice asked, and I looked up into the face of our waitress.

"Dick needs some chicken fingers." I sighed, taking a twenty out of my purse and setting it on the table next to my empty glass. I pushed back from the table, went around to his side, and patted him on the shoulder. "Sorry this didn't work out." The relief was so very evident on his face it was almost comical. He started to stand, and I waved him off as I grabbed my jacket and headed for the door.

Another one bites the dust. Or chicken finger, in this case.

As I shut the front door to my home, the silence was palpable. My shoes rang out dully against polished concrete, the lights low and a bit lonely. I peeled off my jacket, snickering once more when I thought of Dick's face when I took it off. Tattoos were commonplace in this day and age, but there's nothing like neck ink on a girl to make a guy in a suit blink. I shouldn't snicker; he didn't deserve total annihilation like that. Not over appetizers. I tamped the snicker down as I passed by the wall photo of my mom on my way to kitchen. "Sorry, Ma, but come on. Berretta?"

I may have snickered once more. Just the one.

Contemplating the effects tomorrow morning of having one more bump of Scotch tonight, and deciding the hell with it, I splashed a little more into a glass and leaned back against the counter. Polished concrete, like the floor. My home had an industrial feel to it: clean, uncluttered, orderly. Steel, chrome, blacks, and shades of-you know.

Along one wall was a line of pictures, all in black frames with black mattes. Spaced exactly three inches apart (above, below, and in between) were photos of my family. Five older brothers. Mom. Dad. All of us together.

It had been interesting, growing up. By the time my parents got around to having me, they were so used to football, hockey, and baseball, that into the jerseys I went, and never even entertained the idea of a dress. I wore dresses sometimes now, but they were the skintight-over-fishnets-and-combat-boots type. Courtney Love circa 1996. Without the smeared lipstick. Or the heroin.

Growing up with five older brothers meant that everyone in town saw me as one of the "Franklin Boys." Something that became harder to lump me into when I developed serious lumps of my own when I hit puberty, but the fact that I ran around in ball caps and sweatshirts continued the myth. Following in my brothers' footsteps also meant that I excelled at school, particularly math and science, taking calculus in tenth grade. Franklins are good at math and science, therefore as a Franklin, I was too. The hitch in the giddy-up was that I also loved art. Drawing, painting, you name it, I loved it. There's a symmetry to drawing, an innate sense of placement and scale that appealed to my inner math geek. But between after-school sports and advanced placement college prep classes, it was a side that I didn't have much time to explore.

And frankly wasn't encouraged to explore. The family business was computers, and that's what all of us were groomed for. And I followed suit-for a while.

Next to the framed pictures of my family was the single piece of artwork in the room, the only piece that was in color. Bold splashes of bright corals, cotton-candy pinks, soft curling puffs of white. April in Paris. I let my eyes follow the swoops and swirls of color, remembering what it felt like to spend my days in a studio in France. Heaven. A heaven that was a world and a computer software company away.

I pushed the thoughts aside, draining the rest of my Scotch and fumbling for my phone. I decided to bite the bullet and check my messages. There were at least three from my mother and two from an unknown number. Knowing that Mother just wanted to see how the date went, and not caring about messages from someone I didn't know, I erased them all and headed for my bedroom.

Slipping out of my clothes and into a fluffy white robe, I made my way toward the only room in the house that didn't have my monochromatic modern theme. I opened the door into rosy chaos.

Rose wallpaper, rose carpet-if there was a surface I could stick a rose onto, I did it. Gold candelabras too; I had plenty of those. White taper candles with romantic drips spilling down them-it was all there. My private escape. My romantic nirvana.

Soaker tub. Deep. Long. With a shelf overflowing with bubble bath gels, salts, pearls, and oils. Fragrances of lavender, geranium, and of course, rose. I flipped on the radio, tuned to the local classical station, and felt the evening fade away as I turned on the hot water. While I poured the rose-scented bubbles into the stream, my eyes zeroed in on the book I'd be finishing tonight. On the cover? Man. Strong. Fierce. Pecs. Woman. Beautiful. Swooning. Boobs.

Dropping the robe and all memories of Dick Weenie, I slipped into the perfumed water and let my world fade away.

I was sound asleep when my cell phone rang, jolting me out of a dream in which a giant shoe was chasing me down a water slide. I grappled across the nightstand, knocking over a stack of books and a water bottle, finally clutching my phone. "Hello?"

Static.

"Hello?"

"Hello, is this Ms. Vivian Franklin?" a man's voice asked.

"This is Viv, yeah, who is this?" I barked, noticing the time. Who the hell called at 1:28 a.m.? "Do you have any idea what time it is?"

"I am terribly sorry for the time difference. It's considerably earlier here in California."

"Well, bully for all the granola eaters. Who the hell are you, and what the hell are you doing calling me in the middle of the night?"

"Ms. Franklin, I did try calling earlier in the evening. Did you not get my messages?"

"Five seconds, California, or I'm hanging up," I growled.

"Forgive me for saying so, but you do remind me of your aunt." He laughed a cultured laugh, and I frowned.

"My aunt?" I didn't resemble either Aunt Gloria or Aunt Kimberly, and neither of them lived in California. Wait a minute- "Are you breathing heavy?" Ick, he was! "Dude, you picked the wrong chick for an obscene call-"

"Oh, no, Ms. Franklin. I just climbed up a rather long staircase, and I'm afraid the old ticker isn't quite what it used to be." After taking a deep breath, he laughed. "Obscene-the idea. Your Aunt Maude would have loved that."

Aunt Maude. Aunt Maude? Ohhhh, Aunt Maude.

"As in my Great-Aunt Maude? Maude Perkins?"

"Yes, the very one. I'm sure you've heard this time and again in the last few days, but let me please extend to you my condolences."

"Condolences?"

"Yes, of course, on your aunt's passing. My firm represented her for decades, and I'd gotten to be quite fond of her in the last few years. What a remarkable woman."

Great Aunt Maude was ... well ... in need of condolences?

"Okay, California, start from the beginning, including your name and why in the world you'd be calling me in the middle of the night about a woman I barely know and haven't seen in fifteen years. And who by the way, I didn't even know had ... well ... passed."

"Oh my! You didn't know? Well, this is all a bit strange then, isn't it? I'm so very sorry, Ms. Franklin. Let me introduce myself. My name is Gerald Montgomery, your aunt's attorney and executor of her will."

I switched the light on, climbed out of bed to grab a pad of paper, then got back in bed.

"Okay, Mr. Montgomery, you've got my attention. Now tell me everything, including how in the world she died without even one person in my family knowing about it."

"Well, Ms. Franklin, she was, as you are aware, quite eccentric," he began with a chuckle.

Thirty minutes later I set the phone down, utterly numb and confused. I looked back down over the notes I'd scribbled on the pages.

passed away with no one but me named in her will

house and ranch and all worldly goods ... to me?

Mendocino. As in California!

I looked at the clock, my mind whirling. It was too late to call my parents. I'd have to call them in the morning. I could barely process all of this. Crazy Aunt Maude. I hadn't seen her since I was twelve, spending the summer out west with her in her old house.

The old house on a cliff above the beach. Oh my God-the beach house.

I flew out of my bedroom, down the stairs, and toward the bookcase in the living room. I grabbed an old family photo album, filled with Polaroids from family vacations and holidays from when I was kid. Flipping through the pages quickly, I found the ones I was looking for.

I spent one summer in Mendocino, one magical summer with my family and Aunt Maude. It was so long ago I'd almost forgotten it. I closed my eyes, remembering the feel of sun on my skin, salt in the air, and sand between my toes. I opened my eyes and stared down at the picture of the Victorian home overlooking the raging Pacific. Named "Seaside Cottage," it was anything but. Turrets. Widow's walk. Porch for days. Wide plank floors rubbed smooth from years of bare feet running across it. Kitchen garden. Attic, filled to bursting with trunks and old dress mannequins. It was like little girl wonderland.

And I'd inherited it?

And the ranch! Christ, how could I have forgotten the ranch that was adjacent to the picture-perfect house? Acres and acres of fertile California land, dotted with sheep, chickens, and the occasional milk cow. And horses. How could I have forgotten the horses? And the quaint old barn where ... wait a minute ... horses need tending to. Usually by a ... cowboy.

A mysterious phone call in the middle of the night, beckoning me from my sleep. A call that awakened my mind with endless possibilities. An adventure? A new beginning? A journey across the land where a new life awaits? One with a ... gulp ... a cowboy? Shit. I could gulp a cowboy. Especially if I was about to be starring in my very own romance novel. But could I actually move across the country? I didn't know a soul in California.

Wait, strike that.

I picked up the phone to call the only person I knew on the West Coast. One who shared the same sense of adventure that I once did.

It was only eleven o'clock in California. Of course, who the hell knew where he might be, knowing his job? I scrolled through my phone, looking at his name, weighing the decision about waiting to call in the morning.

Fuck it.

I called my old friend from high school, Simon Parker.

Chapter two

"Viv Franklin. To what do I owe the pleasure?"

"Hi, Simon. Did I catch you at a bad time? I figured it wasn't too late to call, since you've never been an in-bed-before-midnight kind of guy, right?"

"No, not usually. Although lately-"

"Spare me the details of your love life, except to tell me that you're still with Caroline, right? You didn't mess that up, did you?" At our high school reunion last fall, I'd met the woman who'd finally tamed the man that is Simon Parker.

"I am indeed. She's back at home in San Francisco. Well, actually, home is now Sausalito."

"Back at home? Where are you now?"

"On a shoot in Cambodia. You'd love it, Viv. I just did a study on the forest taking back the lost temples and cities over and around Angkor Wat. Fucking unreal."

I sighed, thinking back on my more adventurous days. I'd picked my prospective colleges with my parents, comparing the programs they offered in computer engineering, advanced mathematics, etc. But I also spent some time researching the art programs at those schools. And when I chose a small liberal arts college over the prestigious technical colleges my brothers had attended, I told my parents that a more well-rounded education would make me a more appealing young woman. Read: Your "sixth son" is turning into a young woman, and she needs something beyond field hockey.

So off I went, acing my advanced applied mathematics courses and taking some art classes every semester. By the time I was a junior and declared my official major, computer engineering, I stunned my family with my minor: studio art. I further stunned them when I turned down a summer internship at a rival software firm for a summer program in Italy, studying in Florence. What was even more stunning? I spent a semester of my senior year in Paris, studying at the Sorbonne. I took just enough core classes to satisfy my parents and a figure drawing class just for myself.

Graduation loomed, job offers came in, but it was understood that I'd be following my brothers into my father's company. So I did what every girl from a wealthy family does: I rebelled. In perfect, by-the-book fashion. I dyed my hair, got several tattoos, pierced some things that were noticeable-and some that were not-and when I walked across the stage to get my diploma I did so in combat boots and a sign on the top of my cap. In masking tape, I'd spelled out:

MOVING TO FRANCE

This was my totally pu**y in-your-face way of telling my parents I wasn't taking their job, or any job for that matter. I'd secured an internship at a gallery on the Left Bank in Paris, had some money from a trust that kicked in when I turned twenty-one, a travel visa, and a spanking-new backpack.

My. Parents. Were. Livid.

I. Was. On. An. Adventure.

I apologized to my parents, who initially responded with the threat of disowning me and insisting I was throwing my life away. They eventually ended in tears, fearing I'd lose my head and virtue to a Frenchman. They had no idea that my virtue had been lost years ago in the backseat of my car, The Blue Bomber, but that was neither here nor there. The here was leaving my family behind, to do something no one was expecting. The there was a fourth-floor walk-up in the 11th Arrondissement with two roommates I'd met online and arranged a sublet with.

I had the best time of my life. I lived, worked, and loved in the City of Light. I spoke marginal French but learned quickly, ate delicious food, danced in delicious nightclubs, and had my first delicious sexual encounter with an uncircumcised man. Ooh la la. I took art classes, I rented a studio space, I had passionate love affairs with passionate artists as passionate about their craft and their determination to live a bohemian idealistic lifestyle as I was. I traveled throughout Europe and points farther east, resulting in an unexpected meeting with Simon in Istanbul toward the end of my European adventure.

By now I was well into my romance novel addiction, taking any gloomy day or disappointing date as an opportunity to indulge in steamy and dreamy. But while the heroines in my books all ended up with their happily-ever-after, my love life was falling short. Sex life was off the rails, but love eluded me. I'm a reasonably attractive young gal, great rack, nice legs, and never had any complaints in the sack. But I'd never been-cue sad music-in love before. And no one had ever been-cue sadder music-in love with me. No one had ever taken me in his arms, kissed my sweet lips, and whispered the words I love you.

For the record? No one knows that. But back to Paris.

I remained in adventure mode, indulging in very satisfying but safe naked times with beautiful boys, traveled all over, painted whenever the muse struck, and just lived. Lived in that way you can only live in your early twenties, when nothing truly epic has happened yet, and it's time to just dance.

But then my father had a heart attack, which sobered me up fast and brought my traveling ass home. Seeing my strong, invincible father falter like that brought everything into focus. Family trumps everything, and soon after his recovery, I was back in the fold as if I'd never left. I'd had my adventure, I was now twenty-three, and math was calling. I'd actually missed the certainty that came from working with numbers. Safe, solid, wonderfully complex simple numbers.

I retained some of my independence, though. Early on, I got lucky with a computer program I'd written, and used the money from selling that license to fund my own start-up. So I was within the realm of the family business, but on my own two feet. Which were still clad in combat boots. And though I liked my comfortable life, sometimes I caught myself holding my pen like a brush, mimicking brush strokes when I was puzzling out a particularly tricky problem. Sometimes I missed that romantic, wild, carefree lifestyle.

So hearing Simon talk about where he was and what he was doing made me a bit wistful. "Sounds amazing," I said with a sigh. I was dying for an adventure!

"What's up, Viv?" he asked. "What's going on?"

"Tell me everything you know about Mendocino," I said.

"Mendocino? As in California? As in, three hours north of where I live?"

"That's the one."

"Um, it's on the beach."

"That's descriptive."

"You want to tell me what's going on here?"

"I just found out that my Great-Aunt Maude, who I barely knew, passed away and left me her beach house, her ranch, and everything that comes with it."

"Holy shit! So when are you coming out?"

"Not sure yet," I replied, chewing on my fingernail, then sat on my hand. Nasty habit.

"What's your family say?"

"I literally found out thirty minutes ago. My family knows nothing about it," I answered, chewing on my fingernail. Again! I grabbed a sock from the dresser and put it over my hand.

"Wait, wait, so this is, like, all yours?"

"Apparently. The attorney said I can go out there to sign everything and take possession, or he can handle selling everything for me."

"Don't sell it," he said instantly.

"Oh, I'm totally not. At least not until I've seen it again." Huh. Looks like I was going.

"Cool," Simon said.

I agreed. Very cool.

Now I just had to tell my family. Me going off on an adventure? These conversations traditionally never went well.

I took the sock off my hand.

Two weeks, three fights, and four packed bags later, I was ready to fly across the country. Telling my family had been interesting, especially my mother. It was her aunt who had passed away, albeit one she had no contact with. Aunt Maude had pulled away from the entire family toward the end of her life. My mom called a family meeting with her sisters, Gloria and Kimberly, spoke with our family attorney, spoke with Aunt Maude's attorney, and realized it was all very clear. Maude had died without wanting anyone to know except me, her sole heir.

My brothers-Michael, Jared, Greg, Kevin, and Chris-were divided on how it all went down. Michael and Kevin were pissed that they didn't get anything, while Greg, Jared, and Chris just chalked it up to crazy Great-Aunt Maude. What they all agreed on, including my father, was that I shouldn't be heading out there.

"Peanut, do you have any idea what land like that, especially right on the beach, is worth? Why in the world are you not selling it?" my father asked, after all the details of the will had been explained and analyzed.

I rolled my eyes. He'd been calling me Peanut since I'd been the size of an actual peanut. But if by twenty-nine the nickname hadn't gone away, I would be a peanut now and for always.

"Maybe I will sell it eventually. But for now? I just want to get out there, see what's what. Then I'll decide." I looked at him out of the corner of my eye. "Who knows, maybe I'll just stay out there."

I went from Peanut to young lady in 2.2 seconds.

"Young lady, would you care to explain to me exactly how you intend to run your business from California?"

"Dad, I'm hardly pulling up stakes and moving to California. Although technically I can do my job from anywhere, that's beside the point." I tamped down the internal thrill I got from just saying those words out loud. I could work from anywhere in the world, one of the perks of owning an online business. But I needed to focus on the Right Now. This was a fact-finding mission, not an adventure.

It's totally an adventure! Internal Carefree Happypants Viv was dancing a jig of excitement. But External Serious Viv had to keep it together, especially in front of her father. So even though I couldn't keep my mouth from turning up at the corners, I tried to convince my father that this was not like when I ran off to Europe.

"So you're coming back soon, then?" he asked pointedly.

"I didn't say that."

"But-"

"But nothing," I interrupted as he continued to sputter. No one ever interrupted my dad, except me. My father owned a computer software company that had been around since the seventies. He got in on the ground floor of the emerging industry and had been smart enough to stay ahead of the pack. He'd built his business from scratch, and now two of my brothers ran different divisions, two were software engineers working on new programs, and one was being groomed to take over for my father when he retired. Which he swore would be never, but my mother had other ideas.

One of the ideas my father had been entertaining for years, and had been asking me about frequently recently, was selling my company to him and joining him and my brothers. I'd gotten a lot of press within the computer world recently for creating a new app that was snatched up by Google. Not as much money as some apps were being purchased for, but a nice chunk of change. Coupled with the fact that I was still renting the small apartment I'd been in for the last few years, owned my car outright, and spent most of my time with my nose either in a laptop or in a book, I had zero debt and a sizable savings account. Saving for what, I didn't know, but saving I was.

For a rainy day? For something exactly like what had just dropped into my lap by a mysterious phone call from across the land, telling me that my life had changed and if I was adventurous enough to take a chance, everything could change?

Back to the present. A present where, if my father couldn't convince me to sell my business to him, he was still going to tell me how to run it. Or how I was not running it correctly, as so many fathers do.

"Dad, I love you. I love you all. But I'm heading out to Mendocino. I might be back in a few weeks, ready to sell off the land and the house and everything else, but for now? I'm going. And not making any decisions beyond that."

That conversation had ended in grumbles and gruff agreements on both sides.

My mother's argument was of a different tactic, but no less strategic. My mother lived perpetually in the land of Hopeless Romantic.

"You know, I just have a good feeling about this, Vivvie. I can't say exactly why, just that I have a good feeling." She was perched on my bed, helping me pack. Which meant making suggestions about certain clothing items that she thought would be more flattering and appropriate for the trip.

"I have a good feeling too, Mom. Is it weird that I'm excited about something that's the result of someone dying? Is that terrible?"

"It's not terrible, sweetie. It's life. You didn't really know Maude; even your aunts and I didn't. We tried to reach out, to get her to move east to be closer to family, but- Not that red one, sweetie. It washes you out." The red sweater went back into the closet. "And, besides, she loved that house. She always said they'd carry her out feet first. Not the yellow one, sweetie. Makes you look jaundiced." The T-shirt was replaced by a pink one.

"Feet first! Ew, that's f**king morbid." I shivered slightly. I'd be in her house soon.

"Vivvie! Language. Besides, that's how old people talk. They don't think of it as morbid; they're just being obstinate. 'Feet first,' she'd say whenever someone would suggest maybe she should think about moving into a retirement community. That's a pretty one. Green has always been a good color for you, especially with your eyes."

"Mom, I'm not going to a garden party."

"Well, it doesn't hurt to be colorful, no matter the occasion. Now, where are those cute sandals I brought you last week? You have such cute, tiny feet, Vivvie, I wish you'd stop burying them in those combat boots. Who knows who you're going to meet out there! Why you could meet The One! A nice man with a good job and ..."

I tuned out all her nice-man talk. I knew what I was hoping for out there. And it had nothing to do with nice ...

So now I stood at the curb at the airport, surrounded by suitcases and duffel bags, ready to head west. I had a new romance novel downloaded to my Kindle for the five-hour flight, and a bubbling excitement at embarking on my very own adventure, just like the ones in my favorite books.

Bring it.

I'm pretty sure that in my romance novels, the heroine always arrives at her new destination fresh and unwrinkled, smelling of gardenias and excitement.

I arrived at San Francisco International Airport with swollen ankles and a T-shirt covered in marinara sauce from an in-flight argument with a chicken parm. I smelled like recycled airplane air. I was exhausted and cranky from staying up late with last-minute packing, and annoyingly horny due to my marathon read of Loins of Endearment.

I struggled to load my luggage into a cart, then struggled to get it onto the rental car bus, and then struggled to load it into the freaking golf-cart-size car they gave me. I don't know where the midsized SUV I'd reserved had disappeared to, but at this point I would have driven a scooter to Mendocino. I just wanted to get there.

Firing up the putt-putt-mobile, I consulted my GPS, turned on some tunes, and hit the freeway. And then got stuck in traffic. Then hit the open road! Then more traffic.

Determined to keep my adventurous spirit intact, I rolled down the windows to breathe in that California air. Certain that it would be laced with flowers and sun, I was surprised when it smelled the same as Pennsylvania. But no matter. I was here! Aaaand back in traffic again.

Two hours later, I finally saw signs of the shoreline. The state highway began to wiggle back and forth along the coast; I started noticing tiny slivers of peekaboo blue. Rocks rose majestically out of the water, cliffs sprang up and out toward the deep blue water. The Pacific looked angry, crashing against the shore as though it was taking it personally. I found it invigorating; it could thrash itself as much as it wanted to. I loved the sea spray it created; the hidden caves bubbling the water back out as quickly as it was pushed in.

As I neared the seaside town at a grandmotherly pace of forty-seven miles per hour (thank you, weenie car), I decided that it was a blessing to have to go slow. To take in the beautiful surroundings, to not have anywhere in particular to go-and I'd get there when I got there. It was liberating, it was freeing. I had a devil-may-care feeling: I could go anywhere, be anything I wanted-

Honk!

What?

Honk honk!

There was a line of cars on the highway behind me that didn't care for my joie de vivre. Loins of Endearment had been set in wartime Paris, so I had French on the brain. And by French I mean a great war hero, member of the resistance, and the owner of his own very ample baguette. He had taken his lover up against the counter in a bakery, and when he pushed into her, taking her virginity for God and country, the moment was frozen in time. Never mind the bombs falling, never mind the countryside wracked with woe, this was here. And now. And the only thing that could stop the invasion into her heart was the-

Honk honk!

"I'm going, I'm going!" I yelled out the window, pushing the damned car to fifty-five, causing the entire frame to shake and shimmy. Baguette, indeed.

I spied the town of Mendocino in the distance, and pushed it to fifty-seven. Now we were talking!

My GPS took me straight to the coffee shop on the main drag where I was meeting Mr. Montgomery, the attorney who had contacted me. I gazed in wonder at the beautiful town, noting the Victorian homes and neat-as-a-pin front lawns. Cottages large and small dotted the twisting streets, built to take advantage of the natural landscape and picture-perfect ocean views. Set high on a cliff, the town looked down onto the sea below.

With a wide grin, I pulled into the parking lot near the coffee shop. Stretching out after my long drive after an even longer plane ride, I then headed toward a row of rocking chairs on a long porch where a gentleman sat.

He smiled at my approach, standing. "Ms. Franklin, I presume?"

Who says that anymore?

"Just Viv, please. Nice to meet you, Mr. Montgomery." I smiled, shaking his hand. He was tall and stately, his black suit and tie seeming at odds with the casual atmosphere of this little artsy village. But his smile was genuine, and his blue eyes danced. I looked down at my ripped jeans, combat boots, and sauce stained T-shirt, and zipped up my leather jacket. "Turbulence. Not great for eating pasta at thirty thousand feet," I explained.

"Not to worry. I'm sure once you get settled in at the house, you'll be able to relax and clean up a bit. Shall we take care of this business so you can be on your way? I'm sure you're anxious to see everything." He gestured toward a table and chairs where he had some paperwork set up, and I nodded. As we sat down, a pretty woman with dark blond hair crammed unsuccessfully into a ball cap approached.

"Any coffee for you?" she asked, and as I looked down I saw that Mr. Montgomery did indeed have a coffee there. I looked around her to the restaurant we were seated outside. Cliffside Coffee was the sign on the door, and now that I noticed, on her ball cap too.

"Oh, um, yeah that'd be great. Black. Thanks."

"Sure. You the Franklin girl who's taking over Maude Perkins' place?"

Surprised, I looked at her with narrowed eyes. "How'd you know about that?"

"Small town. Coffee shop. I know everything." She grinned. She had an easy way about her, pretty face, good energy, unfazed by my piercings-you never know how some people will react. "Been out to the house yet?"

"Literally just got into town, but you already knew that?" I asked, eyebrows raised.

"I totally did-just making conversation. I'll be right back with your coffee," she said, heading back inside. "Name's Jessica, by the way," she called over her shoulder as she disappeared through the swinging door.

I looked back at Mr. Montgomery, who merely smiled and readied the papers for me to sign.

Frickin' Mayberry.

I liked Mayberry.

"Any idea what you're going to do with the property, now that you're the sole owner?" he asked a few moments later, after I'd signed my name with a flourish.

"Not sure yet. Right now the only thing I can think about is a shower and a nap. In exactly that order." I groaned, feeling the grit of the day literally beginning to settle into my skin. But I would be taking a little tour of my new homestead, grit be damned.

I imagined the way this bit of coastline must have looked back in the 1850s when the town was first settled. Men and women, drawn west by the promise of gold, had arrived with only what could be carried in the back of a covered wagon. Moved by a sense of purpose and adventure that I now shared, did the women stare at the ocean with excitement? With wonder? Covered in actual trail grit, would they be too tired when their husbands, weary but journey strong, cast their eyes toward them with longing? And when the last waning sunbeam from across the ancient Pacific cast its luscious golden light upon her cascading bosom, did he push her back against the wagon wheel with a lusty groan, spilling kisses across her salty skin? And when he had tethered his oxen team to feast upon the fragrant sea grass, did he return to the wagon to unleash his own pair of-

"Ms. Franklin?"

I shook my head to clear it, punchy from my travels and more than a little worked up now. Sick, sick, sick in the head. I smiled innocently at Mr. Montgomery.

"Sorry, daydreaming."

"You've had quite a busy day. I think you've waited long enough. Shall we head over there now?" he asked.

"No need, just point me in the right direction and I can take it from there." I was used to handling things by myself, and while I appreciated the offer, I didn't really want anyone else there when I saw the house for the first time in years. In my head, it was all very dramatic.

"Very well, Ms. Franklin, is there anything else I can do for you today?" he asked, sliding an old-fashioned key across the table. As I picked it up, I felt a thrill roll through me. My key. It was my key now. Antsy, I stood.

"Nope I think I'm good! So which way is it?"

"Just down the main road a bit here and then curve down Maple Street. You can't miss it," he replied, standing and gathering all the paperwork for me. "You let me know if you need anything, promise?"

"I promise. Thanks for everything," I answered, shaking his hand and then practically prancing down the walkway.

Turning down the street, potentially my new street, brought a ton of memories flooding back. An entire summer I'd spent here, the sun on my face and the sand underneath my feet. This town had been my universe, tiny and enormous existing within the same space. I'd often wondered if I'd had the chance to come back again, would it be the same? Would it be as magical, as picturesque, as quaint? As comfortable? They say you can never go home again, but this was never my home. It was my fairy tale.

And as I turned into the long and winding driveway that led up to Seaside Cottage, I was struck by how much more it was. It was even better than I had remembered it. Set apart from the town by maybe not even a quarter of a mile, the house stood sentry over the ocean as it had for more than a hundred years.

I pulled the car into the driveway, the gravel crunching underneath the tires. I gazed up at the two-story Victorian, the tall pitched roof concealing the enormous attic. It was cozy and homey, grand and stately all at the same time. From the car, the sightline was all house and ocean. Once I started for the front porch, the cliff behind was revealed, with the winding wooden staircase I remembered just peeping over the edge, leading down to the beach below.

Looking around to make sure I was alone, and I was, I let out a nervous giggle as I practically danced up the front steps. Whitewashed and bleached out from the sun and salt, the wooden bannister felt warm beneath my hands, solid and perfect. And as I ascended the last charming creaky stair, I stepped onto the wide expansive porch, dotted with ferns and flower boxes filled with a riot of color. Purples, pinks, sunny yellows, and-whoa!

My left foot went through the floorboard, pitching me to my knees and tossing the contents of my bag across the planks.

I took a moment to mentally assess. Foot? Still attached. Shin? Felt scratched up a bit but not too bad. I cautiously pulled my leg from the hole in the porch, testing my weight on the surrounding planks. I'd shredded my already ripped jeans, and it looked like I had a nasty scrape, but I was otherwise unharmed.

"Nice work, Viv, you broke the house," I chided myself. My voice was carried away on the wind blowing in from the ocean. Mmm, salty. Briny. Oceany. I dusted myself off and put my bag back together. Undaunted but with a slight limp, I approached the grand front door, the window just above the doorknob covered in a lacy curtain.

Would it look the same? I closed my eyes for a moment, letting my memory run wild. I recalled the front entryway, deep burnished oak halfway up the walls with a built-in bench just inside for shoes and boots, the space above studded with old-fashioned hooks for jackets and coats. A long mirror, creating the illusion of a space larger than it really was. Wide, shining planked floors leading the eye to a grand staircase of more honeyed wood. The scent of wood soap and lemony oil rubbed into the wood to make it gleam. I could almost see it.

And I would, as soon as I managed to get the old key to work. Twisting it this way and that, I finally got it to turn. I held my breath as I let myself into the house. Preparing myself for the beautiful woodwork, the gentle sun shining through a picture window on the west side, I stepped inside.

I breathed deeply, waiting for the lemon and the pine and the wood soap. But what I got was ... mildew? It was dark inside, and I let my eyes adjust as I let out a mild cough. Throwing open the yellowed curtain on the door to let some light inside, I turned in a complete circle, taking it all in.

Dull, scratched woodwork. Stacks of old magazines. Clothes in piles along the stairs. Dust bunnies the size of their namesakes. The long mirror, foggy and shadowed. And every single hat that had ever been manufactured on the West Coast gathered on a hat tree that was leaned toward me in an imagined jaunty greeting.

I went further into the house, the formerly elegant but cozy living room now almost buried under piles of old calendars, boxes full of what looked like teacups, and again, stacks and stacks of magazines. And old tin buckets; everywhere with the buckets. The dining room? The old table was still there, covered with dolls of all shapes and sizes and about an inch of dust. Into the kitchen I went, and promptly turned right around and came back out. Covering the counter were industrial-size cans of Beanee Weenees, stacked three high like someone was getting ready to cook for a summer camp.

Beanee Weenees. What the actual f**k?

Terrified of what I would find, but determined to push through, I climbed the stairs to the second floor, wincing at how loose the bannister was and how powdery and almost, well, gnawed looking the spindles leading up the stairs looked. The entire staircase used to be grand and gleaming; now it was held together with a prayer. To say nothing of how creaky the steps were as I made my way up, winding around crates of glasses stamped with cartoon characters and bags of what looked like tube socks.

The upstairs hallway wasn't any better. An Oriental rug runner that had seen better days led me through canyons of commemorative cheerleading banners, and an actual suit of armor. Well, half a suit. I'd no idea where the torso might be, but the knight's metal legs were in residence in the hallway. I peeked into one, two, three guest bedrooms and found more of the same: tidy but serious stacks of things. And stuff. It was just more and more things and stuff.

Sighing as I came to the end of the hallway, I opened the door onto what I remembered was the master bedroom. And here was the knight's torso, holding court on a stand in front of the wide picture window, overlooking the sea. Planning a watery invasion? Not likely, his legs being in the hallway, you see.

The ornate four-poster bed, still majestic and beautiful, was sagging in the middle. Well, bowling balls will do that. Yep, seven to be exact. Pink. Lined up down the center.

I turned in a circle, taking it all in.

Aunt Maude might have been shithouse crazy.

I left the house through the back door, testing each floorboard before putting my full weight on it. That scratch on my leg was throbbing. I'd need to head back into town and find some Bactine.

Ugh. I shuddered to think about sleeping in any of those beds until I could do a good airing out. The couch didn't look too bad, though. I could sleep there just for tonight until I could-

I was pulled from my thoughts by a soft whinny. The barn! I turned to look: still weathered red, with a pasture surrounded by a weathered wooden fence. Across the long dooryard from the house, I could see the old pump for the well that had been there forever. As I walked through the grass, a few chickens scratched at the ground.

Mr. Montgomery had said there were still a few animals. Someone from town took care of them, someone who had worked for Aunt Maude for a while. Hank, I think his name was. I hadn't seen any sign of him in the house; perhaps the barn?

I headed toward the barn door, the chickens squawking and making sure I knew my presence was unnecessary this afternoon. I toed my way through and poked my head around the corner.

Warm and still, the oaken beams soared just as high as they did when I was a little girl, when I had spent hours swinging from a rope above. I could see the hayloft, stuffed full with feed for the horses. Er, horse. I counted seven empty stalls, and one solitary horse. Which whinnied again.

"Hey there, Mr. Horse," I soothed, the extent of my equestrian knowledge being exactly zero. But I always see people on television stroking the nose.

I didn't get to the nose. Because before I could get to the nose, I stepped in the shit.

Turns out picturesque old barns with actual living horses also come with poop. Which was now all over my boot. I limped on the left from the porch scratch and dragged on the right from the poop boot right back out into the yard. And for the history buffs out there, apparently shit and hay mixed together literally makes a kind of mortar. Like you could build a house with this stuff. So my right foot now weighed two thousand pounds.

I limped-dragged toward the cliff, trying to scrape my boot off but succeeding only in smearing dandelions into the mixture. "Oh for the love of f**k," I muttered, trying to laugh about this and retain the feeling I'd had before the shit step. I was in love with Mendocino, I was in love with this new adventure, I was in love with-

And then? I saw him. As I stood at the edge of the earth, buffeted by the wind, I saw a distant rider on a black horse on the pristine beach below, which curved as far as the eye could see.

My toes curled up in joy.

He splashed through the surf, galloping through the waves. Hurtling down the crooked, winding steps, down, down, down toward the beach. I forgot my brick shoe, I forgot my ripped jeans, I forgot everything but ... the rider.

And as he galloped closer, his features were revealed. And by features, I mean he wore not a stitch of clothing upon his mighty chest. Long, strong legs wrapped around the powerful black stallion, which snorted and tossed its head into the sea spray. Legs wrapped in the luckiest denim ever sewn led my eyes up, up, up to the most chiseled chest and abs, cut into his golden wet skin by the hand of sweet merciful God himself. Arms? His arms were like pythons, his hands holding the barest of reins, preferring to guide his horse with a gentle nudge and prod. And speaking of a nudge and prod.

His manhood was apparent even through his jeans.

I gulped as I traversed the treacherous steps, finally reaching the beach and slowing my pace as he approached. Closer now, I could see that his hair was long, and flowing, and a blond the exact color of honey and lust. I stood upon the sand as he cantered close, his cowboy hat-a motherfucking cowboy!-tilted back to reveal a face that could make angels sing and devils weep. Square jaw, full lips, and dark smoldering eyes that made me want to get lost in them for the foreseeable future.

He rode his stallion right up to me, looking down at my female form and raising an eyebrow in ... appreciation? Admiration? Total and complete abandon?

Was this Cowboy Hank? Oh my, yes, it was. Because his belt buckle told me so ...

Those perfect lips parted, and he said-

"Hey, lady, this beach is private property. Get the hell outta here."

He spun his horse and galloped away. But as a parting gift, his horse crapped on the beach.

I dragged myself back toward the stairs, my footprints behind me ridiculous due to the now shit-hay-dandelion-sand-encrusted-twice-the-normal-size right side and the hobble on the left.

Not how my romance novel was supposed to start ...

Chapter three

I crawled back into the house, mad as a wet hen. Which I'm pretty sure was cackling at me as I'd made my way through the yard and tried to get the old pump working. It didn't. Naturally.

Cowboy Hank. I couldn't believe it. Not exactly the introduction I'd hoped for. But still, he was dreamy as all get-out. I'd tangled with bad boys before. I could do it again. All great romance novels had a conflict to overcome, right? Granted, they rarely started with horseshit, but I'd adapt. But for now, I had business to attend to.

Humming the Bad Boys theme song, I peeled my disgusting boots off, rolled my jeans up past the muck and the cut in my shin, and headed toward the kitchen. Using the cleanest rag I could find I ran the water until it was scalding hot, then cleaned out the cut. I'd sat through multiple piercings and tattoos; hot water was nothing. Climbing back upstairs, I ransacked the bathroom medicine cabinets, looking for anything I could use to disinfect my leg. The last thing I needed was to get an infection.

Bad boys bad boys, whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do when your horse poops poo ... I sang to myself and the legless knight as I poked around in Aunt Maude's bathroom.

Finding nothing but a bottle of iodine-did they even sell iodine anymore?-I saturated a cotton ball with the brown liquid and dotted it on and around. Gross. But effective for now. First-aid needs temporarily met, I evaluated and assessed.

Drugstore for real disinfectant.

Grocery store for food.

Liquor store for the love of all that is holy.

I changed into a clean pair of jeans and boots, grabbed my bag, and headed back out to the car. On my way, I realized I hadn't looked in the garage. Mr. Montgomery had said there was a car, a real looker. Did I even want to go there?

My leg was stinging. I passed on the garage, I'd take my chances later on. Soon I was heading back into town, looking right and left. I knew I'd passed a-aha! A drugstore. Right next to the grocery store and everything else I needed. Parking my car, I noticed the girl from the coffee shop heading toward me. Jamie? Jennifer?

"Jessica. It's Jessica," she called out in greeting.

"Did I say that out loud?" I asked, mortified. Lack of sleep and jet lag must be starting to hit.

"No, but you had that look. How's the house?" she asked, falling into step as I walked along the sidewalk toward the drugstore.

"The house? Hmm, well."

"I gotta tell you, I'm dying to see the inside of it. Maude's kept to herself so much the last few years, ordering her groceries in, not really coming into town anymore. The whole town's been buzzing about someone new moving in," she said, nodding to an older couple passing by. "Evening, Owen, Polly."

"Lovely evening, isn't it, Jessica?" the older gentleman responded, smiling at me.

"Certainly is," Jessica replied.

Mayberry. Literally Mayberry.

"So where you headed?" she asked. Nosy. But nice.

"Had a run-in with a splintered porch step, so I'm grabbing some disinfectant. Then some beer."

"Good call. Well, if you need a recommendation for a quick bite, the pizza across the street is the best in town. The fact that my boyfriend owns the restaurant is only part of the reason it's the best." She laughed, her eyes twinkling. I looked where she was pointing and saw a bustling, comfortable-looking place. As I'd been cleaning up, the sun had sunk low across the ocean. The lights of the town were turning on. Streetlamps dotted the sidewalks, shops were closing up but still spilled a soft light out onto the pavement. And that fiery ball lit up the western sky like a painting.

Weird day, yes. But oddly great.

"Pizza's good, huh?" I asked, my stomach now rumbling. When was the last time I'd eaten?

"Pizza is freaking great; tell John I sent you. Get him to make you the Butcher Block special, it's unreal."

"Now that you mention it, I'm starving. I could eat an actual butcher."

"Nah, we have a great butcher. Stan. And the town would tar and feather you if you took him out of service. Fantastic ribs."

The town had a butcher. An honest-to-god butcher. I f**king loved this place.

"Okay, Butcher Block pizza it is. Thanks for the advice."

"Sure thing. I put the coffee out at six a.m.; stop by anytime," she replied, pulling off her ball cap and shaking out her hair. With a wave, she headed off down the sidewalk.

I did indeed take her advice and headed across the street. I found John behind the bar, a great big ex-football player type, and told him I heard he was the man to see about a Butcher Block special.

"My girl sent you, didn't she?" He grimaced, but in a good-natured way.

"She sure did. And I have to tell you, I'm from the East Coast, so I'm a little funny about pizza," I replied with a raised eyebrow. He laughed out loud, smacking his hands together.

"A challenge has been thrown down. Butcher Block special it is, coming right up. You eating here or taking it home?"

"Home, I think, but I need to run a few errands in the meantime. Thirty minutes good?"

"It'll be ready in twenty-five."

I told him that was perfect, and set off to grab what I needed to make it through the night in Clutter Central.

I hurried into the drugstore, grabbed some Bactine and Band-Aids, and hit the grocery store next door. I nabbed some cereal and a small container of milk; I'd wait and do my real shopping once I purged the house of all things Beanee Weenee. I also picked up a few flashlights, because the way this day was going I figured it couldn't hurt to be prepared. Checking my watch, I had just enough time to head into the liquor store, grab a six-pack, then back into John's to pick up the most heavenly smelling pizza ever created.

"You stop by tomorrow and tell me that wasn't the best pizza you've ever had." He winked, handing me the box and a big stack of napkins.

"Wow. Lots of napkins. Always a good sign." I laughed, and paid.

"How's the house, by the way?"

"Is there a sign on my forehead?" I asked, shaking my head. "How in the world do you know about that?"

"Jessica told me, but the East Coast thing gave it away." He grinned. "Enjoy."

I smiled, grabbed my change, and headed back to my car.

Back at the house, sitting at the dining room table surrounded by dolls, I ate the best pizza I'd ever had. Halfway through the second slice, though, I covered them up with a tarp.

Dolls are scary f**kers.

I liked my environment clean. Neat. Orderly. Hospital corners? Yes, please. Can labels showing to the front? Thank you kindly. How else could you see what's in the can?

This house was the polar opposite of what I preferred, and yet ... As I bedded down for the night, the bed consisting of cedar-smelling camp blankets I'd dug out of an old chest in a guest room and arranged on the large sofa in the living room, I felt strangely content. Belly full of pizza and beer, pleasantly warm and a bit tipsy, I'd turned out the lights and walked through the lower level once more, checking locks. I paused in front of the picture window, the moon full and bright on the Pacific below. I'd seen some clouds beginning to gather before full dark, but now things looked clear and peaceful.

I had a to-do list started for the next day, but tonight I was beat. Letting the long day finally overtake me, I sank into a deep sleep in my new home. And on the inside of my eyelids? A playback of Hank on that horse. The body, the bulk, the buckle. Bad boy? I could manage that ...

Drip.

Drip.

Drippity drip.

I rubbed my face, wiping it dry. Back to sleep.

Drip.

Drip.

Drippity drip drip.

No. No no no!

I sat up straight, staring at the ceiling, only to be splashed once more. The room was bathed in a flash of light, illuminated like a photograph for an instant, then returned to darkness. I heard a rumble of thunder, accompanied by another flash of lightning. And another round of drips.

Then I remembered the tin buckets I'd moved to make room for my bed. I'd thought they were just placed here and there as part of the random collections. Nope. Rain catchers. Of course there was a leaky roof.

Sighing, I pulled my blankets off to the side, replaced the buckets where I could find the drips, and curled back into a ball. I mentally added another task to my to-do list. I fell back into a troubled sleep while listening to:

Drip.

Drip.

Drippity drip.

The next morning I spent twenty minutes trying to figure out how to make the Eisenhower-era coffeepot work, before I remembered that Jessica had said she opened her shop at 6 a.m. Since I'd been up since 4 a.m. (time difference was going to take some adjusting to), I was in my car and into town almost as soon as I could throw on some clothes. The storm the night before had scrubbed clean the already fresh air, and by the time I'd hit the front door of Cliffside Coffee, the cobwebs were mostly swept from my brain.

A bell tinkled overheard as I opened the door, and I saw that lots of people started their day here. It was a cross between old-fashioned dive diner and cozy coffee shop, and heads turned to check out my arrival. But all in a pleasant Hi how are you? kind of way. I spied Jessica behind the counter, and she waved me down to the end.

"I wondered if I'd see you this morning. Coffee?"

"Bless you."

"Black, right?"

"As midnight, please." I sighed, sitting down on the stool and gratefully accepting a mug.

She set down a menu with a grin, then topped off several other customers' cups.

"By the way, you were right. That pizza was like a gift from the gods."

"I told you! No one knows meat like my boyfriend. Eyes on your own breakfast there, Mr. Martin. I know exactly what I just said," she warned, thumping the counter in front of who I guessed must be Mr. Martin. "Dirty old man." She laughed. He grinned at her but did indeed go back to his own breakfast. "How was your first night?"

"Shitty, actually. Leaky roof."

"Ugh. The worst." She nodded sympathetically, then looked down at the menu. "You know what you want?"

I was famished. That sea air was definitely working on my appetite. "Let's do the Hungry Man breakfast."

"Nice," she said. "I'll go put the order in." She moved away, taking care of her other customers as I watched the comings and goings. There was an interesting mix of people here, old and young. There seemed to be an artistic bent to this community from what I'd seen so far, equal parts California granola/free spirit vibe along with a side of coastal chic. I saw a few guys dressed in coveralls, and it made me think of something. When Jessica brought my breakfast over, I asked her, "So if I needed to get some work done on the house, roof, porch, et cetera, any recommendations on who to hire?"

"Sure, plenty. Want me to put the word out?"

"Yeah, I'm not a hundred percent sure what I'll need yet, but there's definitely some work to be done."

"Sounds like you're planning on staying awhile," she observed, looking at me with a knowing smile.

"You're kind of nosy, you know that?" I remarked, digging into my hash browns.

"Hell yes," she affirmed, setting a bottle of hot sauce in front of me and waving a hello to a new group that had just come in the front door.

I finished up, got a coffee to go, and thanked Jessica in advance for putting the word out to get some help. I headed back to the house ... where there was a cowboy waiting for me.

I drummed my fingers on the steering wheel, looking at the hunk who was on the porch. I noticed he'd avoided the broken floorboard. He stared at me, his eyes hard and unflinching. Recognition flared in them; did he remember me from the beach? Did he think I was still trespassing?

Unfolding my legs from the car, I put on my best strut as I closed the distance between us. My first words to him had to be something memorable, something intoxicating, something to make him think the dirty thoughts. His eyes strayed to my legs as I strode purposefully toward him, clad in short denim cutoffs and recently cleaned boots. And a bandage. Aw yeah.

Now standing at the bottom of the steps, I licked my lips as I appraised him. The seduction of Hank begins with the words ...

"I see by your buckle your name's Hunk. I mean, Hunk. I mean, f**k, Hank. Crap."

He looked confused. Not amused.

Birds chirped. Wind blew. Hank stared. I? Sweat. Aw yeah.

Deciding to pretend I'd not spoken at all, I stared back at him, determined not to say anything.

"So, you're Hank, right?"

Way to go, Viv.

He nodded.

Mmm. Nodding was the best. I wasn't going to say anything else.

The pressure of his silence built.

"I'm Viv Franklin." Sigh.

He just continued to stare, and I wondered if I had Hungry Man breakfast on my face. So much for the seduction of Hank.

"So anyway, I'm Maude's great-niece. Did you even know I was coming out here?"

"Mm-hmm."

He speaks! I mean, he hums!

"Great. Okay, so ..." I trailed off. Nothing. "Yesterday, when we were on the beach? And you said, you know, get the hell off the beach?"

"That was you?"

Okay, I'm a pretty girl. A tough kind of pretty, with the tats and the piercings, but I have a great face and not smallish boobs. Not to mention I was dragging a shit pinata behind me through the sand when we met. So overall, pretty memorable.

But not to Cowboy Hank. This was going to be a tougher nut to crack than I thought. Good thing I liked a challenge.

"Yep, that was me. This is my place now. I mean, I don't know if I'm keeping it for sure, lots of work to be done, and I haven't really seriously considered the implications of actually moving here from Philadelphia, but I'm thinking about it. What is it you do here, exactly? I heard you oversee things, but what does that entail? Does it mean-"

"You sure talk a lot," he mused, hooking his strong hands through his ... gulp ... belt buckle. Mmm, I did love a man who wasn't afraid of a buckle.

"I don't normally." I moved to the side to get out of the sun, and now he was in silhouette. Christ, his outline made me want to lick things. "Anyway, you want to come in?"

"Nope. Just here to feed the horses. I'll be back tomorrow," he said with a frown, turning toward the barn.

As he passed me I caught a whiff of his cologne. Spicy and manly. I suddenly sneezed.

"And stay out of the barn, you're making the animals nervous."

I stood there, evaluating and assessing. This guy was turning me into an idiot! Like, a simpering girly girl who couldn't handle herself around a mountain of man flesh, not at all how I normally was around men. But ooooohhhhh. Maybe this was supposed to be how it was? Like, in a good romance novel the heroine was always affected by the hero. Okay, so, reassess. Reevaluate. The cowboy wasn't going to fall in line. That's what happened, though, right? It couldn't be too easy, or romance novels would just be little pamphlets. There'd be some conflict in this story. Challenges. But no more word vomit hopefully.

I slunk back into the house, avoiding the broken floorboard.

I also avoided the backyard, although I watched from the windows in one of the guest rooms upstairs. I watched Hank move across the yard, feeding the horses and watering the chickens, which squawked gratefully. As I worried the cameo around my neck, I observed the cowboy in his natural element. He liked to work with no shirt on, which seemed so perfectly right and not at all beefcake. I mean, it was warm this morning, almost seventy degrees ...

Once he left in his truck, a great manly beast of a thing, clouds rolling in great waves of lusty dust in his wake, I went to work. I wasn't quite sure how to tackle all the junk. It was a bit sad, actually.

Maude had grown up in this house, where she'd lived her entire life. The house had been in the family for more than a hundred years. When the first generation of my family to branch off the Philadelphia trunk had traveled here so many years ago, what would become the town of Mendocino was still a small settlement. It was composed mostly of families from New England, so the style of homes reflected what these pioneers brought with them: Cape Cod, Victorian, picket fences, and cottage rosebushes everywhere.

She'd lived here when her mother died, and had never left to create her own household. Families had visited over the years; aunts and uncles and cousins and their children had filled this house with laughter and tears, suppers and tea parties. But in her last years, Aunt Maude had withdrawn.

As I began to sort through the clutter in one of the spare bedrooms, I discovered a trove of Maude's paintings. Mendocino had once been an artist colony, and she'd signed and dated every one, starting back in the fifties. I knew I'd get lost if I started looking through them with any kind of order at this point, so I tucked them back into the closet until I could spend more time examining them.

Maude had been an artist. Interesting. My fingers held a phantom brush, noticing the natural light pouring into the room and knowing instantly that this would be a great room to paint in. An inspection of the floor revealed an occasional paint splatter here and there, something I hadn't noticed anywhere else in the house. So she'd also found the light in here irresistible. Feeling a sudden kinship with her, I smiled.

I spent the morning cleaning out the bedroom with the best view of the ocean. Wiping a thick layer of sea salt and grime from the windowpanes, I continued to hum the theme to Bad Boys as I worked. Once the blue of the Pacific sparkled through once more, I searched for more clean rags in the linen closet in the hallway and was thrilled to find a fairly new set of sheets. Buoyed by the thought of sleeping in an actual bed tonight, I headed for the basement to see if the washing machine still worked.

Opening the basement door for the first time, I realized two things. One, the lightbulb was burned out. Two, the motherfucking lightbulb was burned out. Sighing loudly, I threw back my shoulders and bravely tromped down the steps. Into the dark basement of a hundred-plus-year-old house, with nothing but old sheets to protect me.

So there's stupid, and then there's stupid. I've had picnics in cemeteries. I went on a tour of the underground catacombs when I lived in Paris. I was always the last one standing when we played Bloody Mary at slumber parties. But by the time I made it to the bottom of those basement stairs, I was shaking like a horrified leaf. Basement danger, the worst kind.

The sun shone dimly through one dirty window. If I remembered correctly, the washer was on the other side, by the furnace. Turning away from the light, I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw the washer ... next to a pile of heads.

Sheets dropped, mouth opened in a silent scream, my entire body went on lockdown as my brain tried to catch up to what I was seeing. By the time I processed the Halloween label on the box and realized they were just masks, it was too late. Forever in my head, they'd be heads.

You have never seen someone start a load of laundry as quickly as I did. Whistling a happy tune to distract myself, I covered the heads with a big trash bag. Between the dolls and the Halloween props, I was beginning to understand why people can go a little funny when left on their own too long.

I thought about all this afterward up in the kitchen, the basement door firmly latched behind me, and I shivered when I realized I'd have to go back down there to put the sheets into the dryer.

Then I heard a knock at the front door. Would it be Hank? Returning for another round of witty banter?

Wiping my face on the inside of my T-shirt, I realized that I was disgusting and badly needed a shower. Oh well. Resigning myself to it, I headed out into the foyer. Peering through the lace at the window I saw a man, but the profile was leaner than Hunky Hank's. Soccer player vs. football player. Breathing a sigh of relief that I'd have more time to prepare myself for our next meeting, I opened the door.

Brown hair. Brown eyes behind dusty-looking eyeglasses. White button-down. Tweed jacket with ... elbow patches? He was tall, carried a briefcase, and looked exactly like Tom, Dick, and Harry. I could handle this. Hell, I'd just defeated an entire legion of heads.

"Hiya," I announced, surprising him. Pushing his glasses up onto his nose, he glanced down at me. I was dressed for cleaning in a tank top that I'd sweated through, denim cutoffs that showed most of my legs, and a headband, and he took me in with an appreciative glance. Amused, I let him look, and when he finally met my eyes again, I let him know with my look that I'd caught him peeking.

A blush colored his cheeks, and he pushed his glasses up once more.

"Vivian Franklin?" he asked, his voice deeper than I thought it'd be.

"It's Viv. Who's asking?"

"Vivian, my name is Clark Barrow. I heard you were looking to make some changes to Seaside Cottage?"

"Hell yes, probably starting with this porch. It's a death trap, Clark," I affirmed, thumping on the column, which wobbled. "You should see the cut I got on my leg yesterday when I went through the plank." I propped my leg up on the railing just to the right of him, running my hand down to highlight the bandage.

His eyes followed my hand. "That looks like a doozy of a cut," he agreed, his gaze on my skin.

I cleared my throat.

He still stared.

"So, Clark, you're here to put in a bid?"

"A bid?" he asked, looking up.

"Yeah, you said you heard I was looking to get some work done, right? I don't know for sure if I'm staying, but if I'm even going to consider it I'll need to have an idea of what kind of money I'd be shelling out to make this house livable, know what I'm saying? I'm thinking we'll start with the front porch; all these rotten boards are going to need to be torn off. The roof's leaking, so that's obviously the first thing we'll need to start on, and when I was trying to get to sleep last night, before the rain started that is, I could have sworn I heard something scuffling around behind the walls. I'd hate to have to rip out that plaster, but I'm not going to have anything furry surprise me some night so-"

"Rip out the-wait, no. No, no, you can't do that."

"What the hell kind of a contractor are you, Clark?" I asked, my brow wrinkling.

"I'm not a contractor, I'm a librarian. I'm also the town archivist, and that's really why I'm here," he said, pushing up his glasses.

"I'm confused. If you're a librarian, why are you here about ripping off my front porch?"

"No one is ripping off anything, Vivian, least of all this front porch."

"What the hell kind of librarian is in charge of front porches?"

"Not just front porches, the entire house. Seaside Cottage is on the historical register, as is much of the town of Mendocino. So any repairs, small or large, have to be approved by the town-specifically, the director of the historical society," he replied, straightening his lapel.

"And that would be?" I asked, dryly.

"Me," he answered, puffing up a bit.

"I see." I turned away, walking back and forth along the porch, ever mindful of the splintered floorboard. I fingered my cameo while I contemplated this wrinkle.

"So I can't make any changes without consulting you first?"

"Correct."

"Including the front porch."

"Correct."

"Or the wobbly bannister?"

"Good God, no! It was handcrafted by Jeremiah Wo-"

"Easy, Clark, easy," I soothed. "So where does that leave us?"

He looked past me into the house, easily seeing the stacks of boxes. "I'm sure you've discovered that your aunt was a bit of a packrat, but many of the things she owned could easily be donated to the historical society. You know, to make more room for you?" he asked hopefully.

I thought of the paintings in the closet upstairs. I wasn't ready to just let things go quite yet.

Channeling Aunt Maude? Yikes.

"Look, Clark, so here's what I'm thinking. I just got here, haven't even cleared off a bed yet. I slept on the floor last night, can you imagine?" I said, taking his arm just above the elbow patch and guiding him back down the steps.

"I can imagine. I mean, not about the bed of course but-" he stammered, blushing a deep red. I may have let my boobs brush his arm. Sweeten the pot when you can, right?

"So how about you let me get settled, carve out a bit of living space, as it were, and then we can talk some more?" I asked, walking him right back to his car. A Taurus, of course. Safe. Dependable.

"Well, that's just fine, Vivian," he answered.

"It's Viv," I said with a sweet smile. "And if I decide to rip off my front porch, I'll make sure to call you first, huh?"

"I'm not too comfortable with that phrase. Restoration work has to be slow and methodical. Patient."

I leaned one hand on the car behind him, bringing me a bit closer. It was fun making this guy blush.

"I don't know. Sometimes fast and hard and furious has its place-know what I mean, Clark?"

Cue blush. Also cue eye sparkle. Although to be fair, they were more than sparkling. They were burning. Hmmm.

He thrust a pamphlet into my hand, got into his car, and drove away. It was a pamphlet from the Mendocino Historical Society. On the back, his name was listed.

Clark Barrow. Historian. Archivist. Librarian.

He forgot to list Elbow Patch Rocker.

I turned back to the house with a chuckle. And almost stepped on the bad plank again. Slapping the porch railing, which wiggled generously, I muttered, "Can't make any repairs? We'll just see about that."

I worked my ass off all day, stopping only for leftover pizza and beer while standing in the kitchen, picking at contact paper on the pantry shelves. Was this historical contact paper? Was I allowed to pick this off? Or does the future of this town rest on the 1970s snail-and-grasshopper motif on this very contact paper?

After my standing lunch I ventured back to the basement, armed this time with three flashlights and a box of lightbulbs I'd found under the sink. Now fully lit, it wasn't nearly as scary as before. I investigated the cold room, pleased to see that Aunt Maude's jars of vegetables and preserves were still stacked neatly along the shelves, all dated from last season. Yum, blackberry jam. Heading back into the laundry room, I stalwartly ignored the box of heads as I put the sheets into the dryer. I brought the camp blankets upstairs and pinned them on the line out back, letting the winds blowing in from the west catch them on the breeze, snapping the ends. Then I trooped back upstairs, determined to restore order to the bedroom I'd be claiming for now. I scrubbed the floor, carrying bucket after bucket of dingy water out back to dump. I pulled down the old curtains, thick with dust, and contemplated throwing them out. But now that I was thinking about the frickin' historical significance of every last item in the house ...

Grumbling a little, I folded them neatly and set them aside. At some point, things were going to have to get thrown away. But apparently an archivist librarian had to be here for that.

I tackled the hall bathroom upstairs next, and with elbow grease and the grace of God, I got it spick-and-span. I'd found an old box of baking soda in the linen closet and with a bucket of warm water and a brush, I scrubbed the little octagonal floor tiles until they gleamed. The iron tub was still stained a bit despite all the bleach I'd used, but the old chrome faucets shone so I could practically see my face in them.

By the time dusk was setting in, I was tired and stinky, but I had a sparkling clean bedroom and bath. Too tired to even think about food, I stood under the shower and washed quickly, shampooing my hair as fast as I could in case the hot water ran out. Once the particulars were taken care of, I luxuriated under the warmth. Running my hands down my skin, I could feel every muscle that ached from the hard work.

I could also imagine feeling a very particular muscle, one that belonged to a cowboy named Hank. But as quickly as I was beginning to heat up, the water cooled down, shoving my daydreams out of the shower. I toweled off, listening to the house settling in for the night. I finger combed my curly hair as I dried it most of the way, literally too tired to even hold the hair dryer for too long. Clutching my copy of Loins of Endearment, I crawled into the most sinfully plush bed ever created, loving the scent of clean linens and line-dried sunny blankets.

I was asleep before even one loin was endeared.

Chapter four

I dreamed of a man on horseback. Splashing through the surf, his very presence called to me. Walking across the sand packed firm by the waves, I stared at the beautiful man jumping down off his mighty steed and starting toward me. But at the same time, a man who looked curiously like Clark waded in from the sea with a briefcase full of clamshells, letting me know in no uncertain terms that I wasn't to throw out any of the lobsters I might find in my shoes.

"Lobsters? What lobsters?" I'd asked, to the tune of "Rock Lobster" by the B-52's, of course. He'd pointed down, and I was horrified to see my legs were now lobster claws, clacking up and down the beach.

I woke in a cold sweat. But the soothing sound of the waves lulled me to sleep again, and I was back to the Land of Nod in no time.

I woke again as the morning light began to creep into the sky, my body still on East Coast time. I needed to stay up later tonight, try and get on West Coast time. Except for the disturbing dream, I'd slept like a rock. No drips, no leaky roof.

I pulled the covers over my face, trying to squeeze in one more set of forty winks, but it was useless. Then I realized that it was after six. And that meant ...

Coffee!

I threw on some leggings and a fleece, pushed my hair back into a headband, and clattered down the front steps. I decided to walk into town, wanting to stretch my legs a bit after the hard work they'd done the day before, and would surely do again today. Down the long driveway I went, turning down the main street into town. Maybe a quarter mile or so, I could walk it in less than ten minutes, which was nice to know. As I came upon the main drag, I noticed a shop that specialized in antiques, and notably, old paintings. Landscapes, several of the town. I wondered if any of Aunt Maude's paintings would be worth anything. Might be a good idea to keep in mind.

But now coffee called, and I answered it. Pushing open the tinkly door, I looked for Jessica's smiling face behind the counter. She waved, and I headed down to the last seat again.

"Same as yesterday?"

"Yes, please, I'm starving. I forgot to eat dinner last night." I sat down and picked up a newspaper someone had left.

"I've never had that problem, but that's because John is such a good cook," she proclaimed, pouring me a cup of coffee and sticking a ticket with my Hungry Man on the hook behind the counter for the short-order cook.

"I can see how that would never come up," I agreed, nodding a hello to Mr. Martin in the seat next to mine. I began to read the news of the day. Did two days in a row create a breakfast routine? Not sure, but I liked already where this was going.

After I ate my weight in bacon, I headed home. The sun was shining fully now, and it promised to be another clear and warm day. Autumn was beginning back home, but here it was still full summer. As I walked back to the house, I marveled once more at the view. I would never get tired of looking at that ocean. Gulls surfed the thermals, dive-bombing and swirling. As I reached the garage, I stopped to peer through the grimy windows, trying to see what was in there. Boxes, sitting on top of a tarp, which covered a car. I wondered what kind it was. Best guess? A pink Pinto.

I flipped through the keys on my ring, trying a few until one slid home. The door creaked open, disappearing into the rafters with a puff of dust. I coughed a few times, the dust stinging my lungs. I'd inhaled so much of it over the past few days, I'd no doubt that if you patted my lungs, puffs would rise.

I entered the garage, cracked concrete below my feet. I removed a few boxes from the hood, gearing up for the big reveal. Holding my breath as I gripped the edge of the tarp, I pulled it out into the driveway, revealing ... miles and miles of painted Detroit iron.

A 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air convertible. White fins. Whitewall tires. Powder-blue body. Not to mention steering wheel.

"You beautiful thing, you," I breathed, running my fingers across the trim. It looked like it was in good condition, and I could barely believe my good luck. I couldn't wait to drive it! I reluctantly covered it once more with the tarp, then closed the garage door. And as I started walking back toward the house, I noticed the barn door was ajar. I course corrected, heading for the open door. I could hear the rustle of hay inside, and as the chickens hurried from my path I watched for any calling cards the horses may have left. I wasn't doing that again ...

As I poked my head inside, there was Hank. Good God almighty, he was a sight.

Shoveling hay down from the loft with a pitchfork, he was already working up a sweat. I leaned against a barn post, the sweet smell of hay thick in the air. And speaking of thick, his white T-shirt clung to his broad body, which was ridiculously strong. He was like a steak, a prime cut of man.

He pivoted, catching me off guard, tossing down a load of hay right in front of me.

"Hey! Hay!" I cried out, trying to dodge it in time but getting a tuft in my mouth in the process.

"Told you to stay out of the barn," he called down, throwing the pitchfork aside and descending the ladder with perfect grace. I started to brush myself off, irritated with his attitude and also the feeling of hayseeds in my bra, and more than ready to tell him I could go in the barn whenever I darn well pleased when he ... began ... to brush me off.

Strong, capable fingers made deft work of the remaining strands, his hands dancing lightly over my collarbone, straying closer than was probably necessary to my br**sts. I held my breath as he continued, his body noticeably warm within the confined space. His cologne once more rose up in the air and swirled, making me drunk. Making me swoon. Making me sneeze.

"Achoo!" I blew, and hay flew.

In a romance novel, it would have been dainty and darling, a sneeze one could write sonnets about. In the life of Viv Franklin, it was powerful enough to scatter chickens.

His hands left my shoulders and he exited the barn.

I followed. "So, what exactly do you do here, Hank?"

"I take care of the animals," he answered, striding toward his truck.

"Yeah, I got that. But is that like daily? Twice daily?" I asked, still hurrying after him. Ridiculous.

"Depends," he said, swinging up into the cab. He was a man of few words. And pecs you could cut your teeth on. Yes, please.

"Depends?" I asked, slowing down and trying to recover a little bit of mystery, a little intrigue.

"Yeah, it depends. I'll be back later today, going to ride Paula."

Who was Paula, and how much could I kill her for getting to be ridden by Cowboy Hank?

"Paula?" I asked, my voice darkening.

"The mare. I took Paul out yesterday, so it's Paula's turn."

"The horses' names are Paul and Paula?" I asked, raising an eyebrow. "Who the hell came up with those?"

"I did," he replied, raising his own eyebrow. It was a strong eyebrow. I wondered what else he could raise with that eyebrow.

"Those are great names," I whispered. "Really great."

He just nodded his head and started the truck. "Stay out of the barn."

Storming back into the house, I berated myself for turning "idjit" every time this sonofabitch was around. I was determined to make a better impression the next time. But for now, I had more important things to do.

I needed to call my mom.

"Well, it's about time you checked in," was her greeting.

I smiled, sinking down onto a green velvet love seat in the living room. I hadn't had a chance to clean in here, so it answered with the appropriate dust puff.

"Sorry, Ma, I've been a little busy," I started, knowing the response I was going to get.

"Busy, my foot, you're never too busy to call your mother. If it wasn't for your text letting me know you'd actually gotten there I'd have been a nervous wreck."

"I'm good, Ma, everything is good. How're things back home?" If I didn't get her off the guilt train, we'd move to hand wringing and heart palpitations.

"Here? Oh the same as always, getting ready for the big bingo benefit at St. Gabe's next weekend. Did I tell you we got Father Mike to agree to a new caller? I mean, everyone knows Father Mike has called bingo for years and years, but we thought this year we needed some new blood, so-"

As she prattled on about the St. Gabe politics, I tuned out a little bit, letting my eyes wander around the living room. On the opposite wall there was a grand fireplace, mahogany by the look of it, inset with green marble. I pulled myself off the love seat while my mother talked about Mrs. Baxter and Mrs. O'Halloran fighting over who made the best fish batter, and began wiping the grime from the mantel with a cloth. In the hearth was a beautiful old iron grate, in which Aunt Maude was storing her collection of Johnny Mathis records. As one does ...

"So tell me, how's the house?" she asked finally.

"It's good. More cluttered than I remember, but it's still good."

"Aunt Kimberly mentioned that the last time she was out for a visit it had started to look a bit worse for wear. How bad is it?"

"It's not great." I sighed as a piece of the mantel came off in my hand. Oh, for the love of-

"Oh, boy. Do you want your father and me to come out?" she asked as I set the piece of the mantel against Johnny Mathis.

"No no, I've got this. It's just more than I bargained for, I guess," I replied, looking around at the amount of work that needed to be done. "What the hell was she thinking, leaving this to me? It makes no sense." I slumped back into the love seat.

"It makes perfect sense, if you ask me," my mother said.

"What do you mean?"

"Maude knew exactly what she was doing when she left this house to you. You're the only one in the family who wouldn't immediately sell it. Do you have any idea how much the land alone is worth? Oceanfront property in Mendocino?"

"Dad might have mentioned a few numbers," I answered. Zeros upon zeros upon zeros. It was enough to make me dizzy.

My family lived in a part of town that was considered old money, blue blood money, with the occasional new money like us thrown in. We'd been solid middle class until my dad struck gold in computer technology. So while money was something we enjoyed, we also appreciated its value. I can remember sitting at the kitchen table one morning, one of my older brothers pestering my dad for an advance on his allowance to buy some new something or other. "It's only a hundred dollars" was the phrase he used, and a phrase he will never forget. The tirade my father launched into about how we will never be the kind of people who say things like it's only a hundred dollars became a family legend.

Now don't get me wrong, my father gave a lot to his family. We enjoyed a very comfortable life, we belonged to a country club, we went to private schools, we vacationed every summer, Christmas, and spring break, and my parents each drove a new Mercedes every two years. But when my friends at school were driving their parents' two-year-old Mercedes, I was driving the Blue Bomber, an old Buick LeSabre that had been passed down to each brother and in turn, to me.

For the record? I loved that car. When it finally went to the junkyard, I shed an actual tear. I'd lost my virginit-wait. I'm not sharing that story. All I will share is Beck on the radio, a foot on the ceiling, and a seat belt buckle imprint still on my ass the next morning.

But I digress. The point is, my family had done well. And my brothers had done well.

And when I sold my app to Google, I did rather well myself. But not nearly as well as the worth of the land this house was sitting on. Although, could you sell a house that was on the historical register? Is that even possible? I could think of a certain librarian who would know the answer to that ...

"You think Maude knew I wouldn't sell it, huh?"

"I know she did, Vivvie."

"But, Ma, you should see what a wreck it is. I can't even imagine how much it would cost to renovate this place."

"So sell your business to your father. You know he wants it. That'll give you some breathing room to decide what you want to do."

"Sounds like you and Aunt Maude already know what you think I should do."

"She was crazy, not stupid."

I snorted. "She keeps her Johnny Mathis records in the fireplace, Ma."

"I rest my case."

After I hung up with my mother I weighed my options, my thoughts swirling. If I stayed and tried to make this work, I'd have to sell my business to my dad, which wasn't the worst idea in the world. I was proud of the little business I'd built but I could do it again. If I wanted to. The cash would allow me the opportunity to decide what I wanted to do. I looked out the window, to see if the answers were out there.

They were. Jessica was walking up the front steps carrying a pizza. With a smile, I pushed myself off the sofa and reached the front door just as she was about to knock.

"I know I called you nosy, but this is bordering on Single White Female," I joked as I opened the door.

"You've met the pizza man, you know I ain't single," she said, rolling her eyes. "Besides, I told you I've been dying to see the inside of this house." She started to walk back down the steps in an exaggerated way. "Or I could just take this box away; I'm sure you've already got lunch plans."

"Get in here. But I'll warn you in advance, it's a freaking mess," I said, holding the door open so the pizza and my new, insistent friend could come inside.

"If I'm going to make the Butcher Block special a constant in my life, and I see no reason why I shouldn't do exactly that, I'm going to have to start running again." I groaned, patting my stomach. Jessica and I were seated around the grand dining room table, the dolls now uncovered and arranged so we had an audience. She didn't find them as creepy as I did.

"There's some great trails around here. You know where the state park is?" she asked, also patting her own stomach.

"I think so. I passed it on the way into town. The Headlands?"

"Yep, there are some fantastic trails in there. Also around Big River. I'll draw you a map," she said, gesturing for the stack of napkins and a pen.

"Awesome, thanks," I said, getting up and stretching. I avoided looking directly at the dolls.

"So what's your story?"

"My story?" I asked, looking back at her. Though I might have been looking out the back window for a certain someone. Who was supposed to be coming back to ride Paula. Lucky horse.

"Yeah, your story. Everybody has a story." She broke off a piece of crust and pointed it at me. "C'mon, you're stalling."

"I literally just got here two days ago. There's plenty of time for my alleged story," I protested. What I got in return was a very exaggerated display of her getting comfortable.

"Okay, okay, my story. Well, let's see ... I was born a poor-"

"I'm going to go position these dolls all around your bed."

"I'm from Philadelphia, Maude Perkins was my great-aunt who I hadn't seen since I was twelve years old, I'm a computer software designer, and I like pizza. And beer. Especially together."

"Married?"

"No."

"Divorced?"

"No."

"Gay?"

"Not the last time I checked."

"Leave anyone behind?"

"Like in a fallen soldier kind of way?"

"Like in a dating someone kind of way."

"Not the last time I checked."

"Fabulous, I know this great guy that-"

"No, no, and no. I don't even know if I'm staying here and-"

"Oh, you're totally staying here."

"Why is everyone so sure about that?" I asked, my head swimming from the rapid fire.

"Call it a hunch." She laughed, then pointed out the window. "Besides, who could ever leave a view like that?"

"Indeed." Pretty sure she meant the ocean, but all I could see was Hank heading into the barn.

"So, where should we put the jeans?"

"In a puddle on the floor of the barn sounds good to me," I breathed, leaning my forehead against the cool glass of the window. He'd mounted Paula.

"Viv?" I heard behind me.

"Huh? What?" I turned to see her with an armful of jeans, just one of the many stacks of oddities that lived in the dining room. "Oh hey, you don't have to do that. Seriously, that's very sweet of you but-"

"Eh, it'll give me a chance to snoop around."

Who was I to say no to free help? Especially when I genuinely liked the helper. Nosy? Shit yes, but I was used to being around a large family, always nosy people around. And when there was a project this big? There would have always been people there to help out. So I accepted her offer, loaded her up with jeans and a large garbage bag, and let her snoop.

Within an hour, we'd uncovered a whole load of interesting. In a closet upstairs we found a cedar chest full of hatboxes, hats included, some with the tags still on. As we tackled the second bedroom upstairs, we found an entire set of Haviland china underneath ten more bags of tube socks. And in a shoebox at the back of the linen closet we found ... well. Some rather interesting reading material of the scantily clad variety, circa 1940s. I was looking at exactly this when I heard the faint telltale sounds of clip-clopping coming from out back.

I hurried down the backstairs in the most nonchalant way possible, past where Jessica was perched on the bed sorting through another cache of dolls. She'd asked about my story, but I wanted to know his. What made Hank tick? I wanted to peel that onion, and in a very specific way.

Checking my reflection in the mirror, I imagined the way a great heroine might go out to greet her returning lover on a mighty steed. Grabbing two beers from the fridge, I moseyed out back toward where he was brushing down the horse after the long ride.

He didn't look up.

"I brought you a beer; thought you might be ... hot."

He still didn't look up, his movements soothing and methodical as he ran the brush thingie all along her pretty white coat. At one point he stood and walked around to the other side, making eye contact only once. I raised the beer but he shook his head, returning to the horse. "So, Hank. Can I call you Hank?"

"What else would you call me?" came his muffled reply from the other side of Paula. Who turned her head toward me and showed me her teeth.

"Right, what else indeed. So, Hank, do you live nearby?"

"Yep."

"In town?"

"Not far."

"I see. Have you worked here long?"

"Miss Perkins hired me a few years back, let me come and go as I please," he said, now straightening to his full height. Even with the horse between us, I could feel the heat of his eyes, now assessing me and my totally obvious interest. "I liked that. I like it best when I can just come. And go."

Oh. Oh my. Thrilled to have finally gotten a reaction out of him, I tried to contain my excitement. I tipped the beer bottle back to take a sip, sneezed suddenly, and poured it on the side of my face instead. Aw yeah.

For the record, this kind of thing never happens to me; I'm usually very good at the flirting. But this man made me come unglued. And speaking of glue, I'm pretty sure that f**king horse was laughing at me.

As I turned to clean off, I saw Jessica standing on the back porch with a barely contained smile. Rolling my eyes and turning back toward Hank, I saw that he wasn't bothering to contain his own smile. I'd never seen him smile before. It was luminous, radiant, exciting, and stunning. So stunning in fact that I almost didn't notice that he was actually laughing at me. Well, to be fair, I'd laugh at me too.

In fact, I did start to see the humor in this situation. I had the Fabio of cowboys in front of me, with no shirt on per usual, and I'd just poured a beer in my ear because I was so darn twitterpated.

And speaking of shirt, what the hell did this guy have against shirts? Not that I was complaining. I mean, come on. Pecs. Abs. And the like. But seriously, what was up with that? Just another layer of that onion I'm going to peel. With my teeth.

I tried to salvage what remained of the conversation. He'd finally been sharing details about his life with me. He lived "not far," and he-oh right. Coming and going. Sexy, sexy man.

"So, you were saying. You like to come and-"

"Go. Yep. I'm outta here," he said.

He walked by me, and right on cue ...

"Achooo!" I held tight to the beer bottles, closing my eyes at the terrific sneeze. And another. And a frickin' nother. It was a sneeze parade. I had literally sneezed more in the last two days than I probably had in the last two years. I heard the sound of his manly truck retreating in the distance, and I kept my eyes closed in embarrassment until I was sure it was gone. I heard gravel crunching, and then I heard someone approach. Jessica.

"This would be a good time to practice not being so nosy," I started, opening my eyes ready to see her knowing look. What I saw was- "Clark!"

I stepped back, surprised and annoyed that he'd arrived during all of this and I didn't even notice. It was the Hank goggles. "You scared me to death!" I protested, turning quickly and heading back to the porch. I set down my beer, wiping at my nose. "You shouldn't sneak up on people like that."

"I'm sorry. I did knock, several times in fact, but then I heard voices so I just came around. Hello, Jessica," he replied, following me up the steps.

"Hey, Clark." She smiled.

Today he was in a blue shirt, button-down of course, plaid tie, paired with his tweed jacket. Chinos, brown. Glasses, dusty. Hair parted on the side, swooped down in an almost old-fashioned manner. He looked at me expectantly.

"So, what can I do you for, Clark?" I asked, lifting up my T-shirt a bit to wring out the spilled beer.

His eyes dipped, his gaze drawn to my exposed belly. The two rings in my navel seemed to fascinate him. And make him nervous. "Beer?" I asked, knotting my T-shirt in the back, keeping my tummy exposed. He cleared his throat, then refocused his attention.

"It's two o'clock in the afternoon, Vivian."

"I realize that," I replied, draining the rest of the bottle. "And it's Viv."

"I came by today to show you something that I came across in the archives. Thought you might like to see this house as it was when it was originally built." He gestured to the brown-paper-wrapped package under his arm.

"Sure, let's see it. Come on in the house. Jessica, you coming?" I asked, herding Clark toward the door.

"Oh, I wouldn't miss this for the world," she said, a mischievous and gleeful look in her eye.

Unfortunately, what started out as a simple look at a picture turned into a war of words. The word being ... balustrade. Or as I liked to call it, that row of spindly things.

"You don't understand, you can't just go changing things willy-nilly! Not in a house of this stature, with this much significant history!"

"Let me tell you exactly what you can do with your stature-and did you really just say willy-nilly?"

We were standing on either side of the dining room table with the picture in front of us, Jessica and the creepy dolls bearing witness to the most ridiculous fight ever.

"It is willy-nilly when you talk about getting rid of things like a balustrade from this era. Do you have any idea how much craftsmanship went into this entire staircase? The balustrade alone is worth-"

"What the hell is a balus- Whatever you called it?"

"A balustrade, Vivian, is the row of individually carved spindles and the bannister they're connected to. Which you want to casually throw out like a load of kindling-"

"I did not say I wanted to throw it out; just that it needed some work so that I don't go tumbling down ass first some night when I'm throwing out buckets of rainwater pouring through the sieve masquerading as a roof! All I suggested was that perhaps replacing the old pieces with something newer might make things a bit more safe and-"

"You can't replace a balustrade like that! They literally don't make them like they used to. You think you can just waltz into a Home Depot and pick up a balustrade that-"

"If you say balustrade one more time, I will slap you right in your very own balustrade!"

"That doesn't even make sense! Vivian, what can I say to make you understand how important these things are?"

"You can start by calling me Viv, dammit. My name is Viv!" I shrieked, slamming my fist down on the table and making the dolls bounce.

"Can I just interject something here?" Jessica asked.

I leaned over the table across from Clark, seething mad. And for a man in a tweed jacket, he could get worked up. He was breathing hard, his top button had come undone, and his tie was askew.

I was breathing hard myself. Fucking baluhoozie.

"How about we just dial it down a bit?" she asked.

"I don't need to dial anything down. He's the one who came into my house, trying to tell me what I can and can't do with it-"

"It's your house, but it's on my register, Vivian. And I have a responsibility to this town to uphold the-"

"Oh, uphold this!" I snapped, my flipped bird ending the conversation with real dignity.

Silence. Except for all the heavy breathing.

"Impossible woman," he muttered, straightening his tie and picking up the picture that had brought him here in the first place.

"Impossible woman," I mimicked in a tone I hadn't used since third grade. I accompanied it with a face I also hadn't made since the third grade. Honestly.

Clark started gathering his things together, stacking them neatly and replacing them into his briefcase. "I can see that reason won't work here. Since you're new in town I wanted to be as neighborly as I could, but now? Here's what's going to happen."

He pointed his finger at me. "You can't change a thing in this house without going through me. Go ahead and check with Mr. Montgomery, he'll tell you the same thing. Not one thing, Vivian."

And with that, he left.

I slammed the door with a frustrated growl. Jessica started to say something but I held up my finger, scrambling for my phone in my pocket and dialing angrily. I really missed punching actual buttons sometimes, especially when I was this pissed off. It was hard to get rid of tension when you had to dial so delicately.

"You calling Mr. Montgomery?"

"Nope, I'm calling Simon."

"And Simon is ... ?"

"An old friend." He answered his phone. "Hey, Simon. Your girlfriend's a decorator, right?"

"Shit, don't ever call her that. She's an interior designer. Why? What's up?"

"I need some professional advice. You guys want to take a road trip up the coast?"

I hung up a few minutes later, my grin wide and toothy. I had backup rolling in this weekend.

Chapter five

"So let me get this straight. You inherited this house, and it's on the historical register in Mendocino County, correct?" Caroline asked.

"Correct."

"Not surprising. Most of the town is on the historical register."

"So I've been told," I seethed through gritted teeth. I was on the phone later that night with Simon's girlfriend, Caroline, whom I'd met at the high school reunion I'd attended last December. She seemed cool, and Simon was totally over the moon for her, something I never thought I'd see. "So is he right? I can't make changes to it?"

"Can't say yes or no at this point; let me do a little research. Typically, if a house is on the historical register but hasn't received any kind of federal funding, then the owner is free and clear. But don't quote me on that. Do you know if your aunt ever received any kind of grants or anything?"

"I have no idea. I can try to find out, though. I'm meeting with her attorney tomorrow."

"Okay, sit tight and I'll do a little digging on my end. Who's the guy that's causing so much trouble?"

"The librarian. Who knew?"

"Sounds interesting. The whole thing sounds interesting, actually. I love that area! Those old homes are fantastic; I can't wait to see it," she gushed.

"I'll be glad to see you too," I replied dryly, and she caught herself.

"I mean, we're coming to see you, of course," she said. "But the house, holy shit! You said it had four bedrooms, is that right?" she asked, and I could hear Simon telling her to wrap it up. I laughed, and let her gush another moment before she said good night, handing the phone back to Simon.

Apparently one of Caroline's best friends had a vacation home in the area, so another couple was traveling up with them. Frankly I didn't care who the hell showed up, as long as someone could get Clark off my back.

"Viv? You still there?" I heard Simon ask.

"Yep, sorry. So, Friday afternoon?"

"Yeah, we'll try to get out of the city as early as we can, but with traffic it'll probably be late afternoon before I get up there. You want us to come straight to the house or-"

"Sure, just come on over and then we can head into town for dinner. The place is still a mess, not exactly ready for a house party."

"No problem, I'll call you when we're on the way. And, Viv?"

"Yeah?"

"It'll be good to see you. I'm glad you called us."

"Christ, Simon, are you an 'us' now?" I teased, hearing him sigh into the phone.

"Nice. I'm coming to help and you're busting my balls?" he asked, and I heard Caroline in the background chime in with, "No busting the balls, they're great balls!"

"Oh, for God's sake, good night!" I said, hanging up.

Simon had gone through hell when we were in high school, losing both his parents in a car accident only a few months before graduation. As a result, he'd left Philadelphia and never looked back. I was glad he had someone as great as Caroline seemed to be, especially after bouncing around from woman to woman for years. She seemed to keep him on his toes.

And speaking of toes, I was ready to get off mine and have some dinner. Awhile after Jessica had left, I'd headed into town to grab some things from the grocery store. I'd shopped in a frenzy, still worked up after the Battle of the Balustrade. As a result I came home with things like three jars of peanut butter, but no jelly. But I did have salad fixings, so I used those to compose my dinner. I ate on the back porch, watching the waves roll in. They calmed me down: the tension that had been in my body since this afternoon all began to leak out as I relaxed while I ate. I could see the chickens still pecking about in the yard, not yet ready to head into their coop for bed. I knew literally nothing about chickens. Except that I liked to eat them. And eggs. Hey, did I have access to fresh eggs now?

I was going to have a chat with Hank the next time I saw him about what exactly he did and what exactly he was being paid to do. Wait, was I paying him? I added it to my mental list of things to talk to Mr. Montgomery about. I'd called him after getting off the phone with Simon earlier, and he'd agreed to meet me in town tomorrow to go over a few more things.

In no particular hurry after dinner to head inside, I wandered around a bit in the backyard. Staying away from the barn, in case Hank was right and I was in fact spooking the animals, I poked around in the old kitchen garden. I had very clear memories of when I'd visited before and seen row after row of raised beds, just off the side of the house beyond the kitchen. Aunt Maude was big into home remedies, the more natural the better. She always had beds filled with lavender, comfrey, calendula, echinacea. If you could find it at a health food store, you could also find it in her backyard. Of course all your better herbs were represented: You had your parsley, your sage, your rosemary, and several varieties of thyme, the lemon scented being my favorite. And the most gorgeous and well-tended vegetable garden I've ever seen. Before growing heirlooms was something everyone was talking about, she had her seeds she'd saved year after year. Carrots, tomatoes, poles of bean runners that I swear grew fast enough you could see them move, and blackberry bushes thick with purply fruit.

Now? It was a mess of weeds. The occasional volunteer carrot poked through here and there, but mostly it was an overgrown mess. That was something I was going to have to remedy. Might not be able to get it done right away, but it would be nice to have some growing going on back there again. I gazed out over the pasture on the other side of the barn, thinking back to how much land used to belong to this plot. Sold off in parcels over the years, it was still a nice spread, and the pasture still stretched over the hill. But so much less than it used to be. I sighed as I shuffled through the dusty soil, turning back toward the house. Lots of work to do. But no more tonight.

I spent the rest of the evening sprawled out in front of the old television, watching the one channel I could get with the rabbit ears. Honest-to-god rabbit ears. The TV was one of those old box ones, with the wood veneer surround and actual legs. The rabbit ears were made out of a wire hanger wrapped in aluminum. I was too tired to care, and I dozed in front of it watching Lawrence Welk on PBS. I began to doze off before he could get through the a-one-and-a-two.

Sometime after midnight, I headed up to my bedroom, automatically dodging the stacks and piles that littered the floor. Falling into the soft bed, I wrapped myself in the cozy blankets and fell asleep once more to the sound of waves crashing.

The next morning I slept in until 5:30 a.m.! Considering that was eight thirty back home, I pronounced it a triumph. I was planning on staying in this morning, having some cereal and getting a jump on the day, but then I remembered how antiquated the coffeepot was. Technically, it might even be a percolator. Technically, I wasn't messing with it. I put "coffeepot" on my list of things to buy, and got dressed to head into town.

Deciding to walk again this morning, I said hello to the Bel Air in the garage. I needed to find the key to that beauty. There were several junk drawers in the kitchen that it could be in, to say nothing of the thousand other crazy places it could be in that house.

As I walked down the drive, I heard a dog barking nearby. I was suddenly struck with the realization that if I stayed here, I could get a dog! Not that I couldn't back home, but I never liked the idea of keeping a big dog confined to an apartment. And big dog I would have, no tiny yippy yappy for me. And with this house and pasture? A dog would be perfect. I'd put a pin in it for now and think about it later, but it was definitely a plus in the Stay in Mendocino column. Which was growing ever larger the longer I was here.

Heading down the road into town, within minutes I was on my stool at the end of the counter, and ten minutes after that I had a plateful of breakfast and an earful of observations from Jessica.

"I just couldn't believe what I was seeing! I have never seen him so worked up!"

"Don't blow a gasket, he wasn't all that worked up," I replied, poking my sunny-side-up egg with a piece of bacon, making the yolk run all over.

"Listen, I've known Clark Barrow since we were in grade school. He never gets worked up. He is always Mr. Calm, Cool, and Collected. The only time he was remotely this excitable was when they announced they were making the Lord of the Rings movie."

"I think you're making too big a deal of this. Tabasco?" I asked, forking up a mouthful of hash browns. "You've known him that long?"

"Girl, I've known everyone that long." She handed me the hot sauce. "Clark was two years younger than me, but yeah, I've known him a long time."

"Thanks," I said, sprinkling the hot sauce liberally over my plate. "And he's always been this uptight?"

"You know, it's not that he's uptight. I don't want you to get the wrong idea about him. He's just ..."

"Rigid? Unrelenting? Stick up his ass?"

"Studious. Methodical. Organized," she said with a pointed glance.

"Okay, okay, if you say so. But from what I've seen-"

"From what I've seen, you can't keep your brain from scrambling around Hank. What's that about?" she asked before I knew what was happening. I crammed a forkful of hash browns into my mouth and made a show of chewing. She laughed out loud, pouring me and everyone else at the counter a hotter upper. Any time she made a move toward my end, I shoveled in another mouthful.

This thing with Hank had turned me inside out. I'd never acted like this in front of a guy before. But I was now living out my own romance novel, right? I mean, that's what this had all been about. The mysterious phone call in the middle of the night, the move across the country, the cowboy riding a horse on the beach without a shirt on? Who has a tough exterior, but inside, down deep, deeeeeep, there resides a heart of gold? Right?

Was he the one? The man who would finally say those words I'd never before heard? Had I finally met my I Love You Man? My instincts were telling me yes, in fact I had.

Patience, Viv. Peel that onion. Reveal the layers. Anyone with a chest like that is worth waiting for. Worth sneezing for.

When the plate was metaphorically licked clean, I waved her over. She came quickly, eager to dish.

"Okay, I'll bite. Tell me all about Hank."

"Hmm, let's see. I've known him about as long as Clark, he's actually a year older than I am. Played football with John; they used to pal around back in the day. Hank is ... hmmm ..."

Handsome we knew. Incredible to look at was a given. Here came the real insight into the enigma that was Hank. Sweet? Kind? Passionate? Hung?

Get a grip, Viv.

"Simple," she said, setting down my check.

"That's it? Simple?"

"Mm-hmm. That's all I'll say for now," she replied mysteriously, and walked away.

"Simple?" I yelled after her, causing everyone to turn and stare at me. I stared them all down. "Morning Mr. Martin." I laid my bills on the counter and sauntered out the front door.

Back at the house I spent some more time in the second bedroom, steadily making my way down the hallway. I was leaving Aunt Maude's room for last; I couldn't even imagine taking that on yet. And besides, the Legless Knight seemed to have things pretty well under control in there. I kept the laundry moving, washing sheets for the bed even though I was pretty sure I'd picked my bedroom. As I cleaned and organized, divided piles, and sorted through years of accumulations, it felt better to be able to walk by two bedrooms that looked livable.

Clean white cotton sheets now covered the bed in the second bedroom. I'd washed them twice and added extra softener so they didn't have that folded-in-the-linen-closet-for-years look to them. I'd lucked out in a hall closet and found stacks of lovely old quilts, folded neatly and encased in Aunt Maude's favorite storage container, Hefty bags. They'd done their job, though; the quilts were in great shape. Now the old iron bed was dressed with a simple but very pretty nine-block piece in lemony yellows and dusty pinks. Not my taste, but chrome and black leather would be out of place here. In this house, quilts just felt right. And if I was being honest with myself, I liked the look more than I thought I would. I scrubbed the wood floors not only in the second bedroom, but down the hall as well. Slowly but surely, clean spots were starting to take over. I'd nearly used up my meager cleaning supplies, though, which meant another run into town.

I consolidated Post-its and to-do lists from all over the house and made one big master list. I needed to hit the grocery store once more, lay in supplies for the weekend. Simon and his gang weren't staying here, but I still wanted to have some snacks and drinks on hand.

I made a cursory pass through the kitchen drawers, looking for the key to the Bel Air, but found nothing. No matter, I'd add that to the list of questions I would be asking Mr. Montgomery. I was meeting him after my shopping trip.

I drove into town, thankful I had a rental car but still not entirely sure how long I'd actually need it. If I was going to live here, I'd have to either bring my car out from Philadelphia or sell it and buy something here.

Or you could drive the Blue Bomber 2.0.

In an instant, I saw that car driving up the coast, top down like it should always be, whitewalls shining. The woman behind the wheel had dark curly hair, not unlike mine perhaps, tied back by a cheery aquamarine scarf. There was a song playing on the radio, something beboppy and doo-woppy, something designed to make your fingers tap out the rhythm on the steering wheel and sing along, even if you don't know the words. The woman pulled the car over to admire the view. To the left of the car, the Pacific. To the right of the woman? A man.

A man also designed to make you tap out a rhythm, on his back. His strong and magnificent back, skin of the most golden velvet, sheened with sweat earned not from a hard day's work, although he was certainly no stranger to that. No, this sweat was of the sweet kind, brought forth from each pore as a testament to this man's pure and unadulterated sexual prowess. His pulsating pillar of passion tall and proud, like a flagpole on the Fourth of July. But the fireworks hadn't begun yet. Not even close ...

Um. Yeah. I was losing it. Cowboy Hank was doing a number on me ...

And that number was sixty-nine-

Stop it!

I went into the store and busied myself with choosing cleaning products, and damn me if Mr. Clean didn't look particularly fetching. I slapped myself with a new sponge and kept on walking.

Stocked up and loaded for clean, I dropped off my supplies at the house and headed back into town for my meeting with Mr. Montgomery. He'd agreed to meet me at John's, the restaurant I'd been getting my pizza fix from. Sliding into a booth, I waved a hello to Jessica's boyfriend behind the bar.

"Ms. Franklin, delightful to see you again," Mr. Montgomery said. He nodded toward John. "Looks like you're making friends."

"Oh, I'm a regular gal about town." I grinned, scanning the menu. I needed something light today; I'd been eating like a truck driver. "Oh look, a Philly cheesesteak. On whole wheat? Blasphemous."

I shook my head. One thing you can't get anywhere but back home was a cheesesteak. Or a good hoagie. When the waitress came by, I squelched my cheesesteak argument and ordered something healthy. A cheeseburger. The healthy? I didn't add bacon.

We kibitzed for a few moments about the house, the weather, the town.

"So, you said you had some questions about the will? What can I help you with?" he asked, folding his hands across the table.

"Yeah, a few. The car in the garage, any idea last time it's been run?"

"I'm pretty sure your aunt kept the Bel Air tuned up; she loved that car. Though she didn't drive it the last few years, Mr. Higgins drove her into town in it a few times in the last year."

"Mr. Higgins?"

"The man she hired to help out around the house and barn."

"Oh, Hank! Let's talk about him. Who exactly is paying for the cowboy?"

"The cowboy?"

"Yeah, Fabio. Mr. Man. Whose payroll is he on?"

"Ah, yes. Maude provided for him in the will as well, provided he stays on to tend to the animals. She did love her animals. Used to have more of them, you know, but now it's just the two horses. And the chickens, of course."

"Yeah, about those chickens. Who owns them? Do I?"

"Yes."

"And the horses? Paul and Paula? Are they mine?"

"Yes."

"So, who does Hank work for?"

"Well, technically Maude."

"So how exactly is that going to work out long term?" I asked, taking a slow draw on my cherry Coke.

"That's up to you and Mr. Higgins to figure out."

"Not helping me here. If they're my chickens, can I use the eggs? He takes care of them, but they belong to me, so who gets the eggs?"

"Interesting question. I didn't expect to be debating the chicken versus the egg argument today." He laughed, and I frowned.

"Glad I could amuse. Do I get the eggs?"

"In my professional opinion?"

"Uh-huh," I said, then bit into my burger. "Oh mah gaw."

"Are you all right, Ms. Franklin?"

I nodded, unable to speak through the best burger I'd ever tasted.

I caught John's eye and waved him over. In the time it took him to get to the table, I ate three more bites.

"What's up, Viv? Hey, Mr. Montgomery, how are you?"

"Good to see you, John. How's business?" he asked.

"This burger is so good, it's stupid," I burst out. "I thought California was supposed to be full of vegans sprinkling sprouts on everything."

"That's at the restaurant across the street. You detox there, you come here when you want real food."

"I love you," I said, stroking my burger like a kitten.

"Me or the cheeseburger?"

"I can no longer separate the two."

"I won't tell Jessica." He laughed.

"You two chat about business. I'm eating," I replied, gesturing between him and Mr. Montgomery. As the two men talked, I demolished my lunch. I could feel my pants stretching, I needed to run tomorrow. As I ate, I listened to the two men talk. Mr. Montgomery really seemed to have his finger on the pulse of everything that went on in this small town. I assumed he lived out of town; his firm was in San Francisco.

When John went back to work, and the burger was nothing more than a memory, I looked at Mr. Montgomery. "How in the world do you know so much about this town?"

"I was born here, and I lived here for years."

"But isn't your firm in San Francisco?" I asked, confused.

"It is. And I live there mostly. But I've got a house here just outside of town, and while it used to be for vacations, as I get closer to retirement I find myself back here more often."

"I can certainly see why. The people are great, and the landscape, it's kind of awesome."

"The people are great, although I hear you had a run-in with Mr. Barrow?"

"How in the hell did you hear about that?" I asked, incredulous. Seriously, how did word spread so fast?

"I have ears, Ms. Franklin. And he can be a great help to you, setting up a new life here. No one knows more about this town than he does."

"He sure likes to remind me of that. But don't worry, I've got some help of my own on the way."

"That sounds mysterious." He chuckled. "I do think perhaps you should talk with him again. He really is only concerned with maintaining the integrity of the house-a concern I'm sure you share."

"I do, of course I do. But does he have to be so ... so ... I don't know ... librariany about it?"

"Ms. Franklin, are there any other questions you have about the will?" he asked patiently, not without some amusement in his expression.

"Well, yes, actually. There are some issues with the house, issues that Clark seems to think are no big deal. But when there's rain falling on your head in the middle of the night, they tend to be a big deal to the one with the wet face, you know?"

"I can imagine." He smiled. "And you're wanting to get the roof fixed, I'm sure."

"Well, that's the thing. If I stay, the house needs a lot of work. And he-"

"You're concerned that Clark doesn't want you making any changes to the house, yes?"

"His exact words were, 'You can't change a thing in this house without going through me. Go ahead and check with Mr. Montgomery, he'll tell you the same thing. Not one thing, Vivian,' and he even pointed at me. So tell me the truth, is he right?"

"It's complicated, Ms. Franklin," he began, clasping his hands across the table from me. "Your aunt was a bit eccentric, as I'm sure you are aware."

I thought of the dolls, the Mathis records, and the tube socks. Eccentric was an interesting choice of words.

"She wasn't always wise about money, and some years she had trouble keeping up some of the maintenance on the house, as you've no doubt noticed. She applied for and was given a grant from the historical society for some basic upkeep. She was able to continue to pay for some things on her own, her basic needs and keeping on some of the animals. She was able to continue to employ Mr. Higgins. But some of the money wasn't spent in the wisest of ways."

I thought of the dolls, the Mathis albums, the tube socks. Not to mention the suit of armor. Wow.

"There are updates that need to be made to the house, Ms. Franklin, and I'm sure if you decide to stay, you and Mr. Barrow will be able to come to some kind of agreement to ensure that not only are your great-aunt's wishes carried out, and the integrity of the house preserved, but that you also don't have to endure a leaky roof."

I thought for a moment. "So, the bottom line is if I decide to make some changes, the librarian is involved. Yes?"

"Yes, up to a point."

I leaned across the table. "I'm going to need to know exactly where that line is."

Chapter six

I pushed myself harder, lungs burning and legs quivering, up the last crest of the hill. I laser locked on the top, only yards away, using my last burst of energy to crash through the trees and reach the top. Letting my feet slow down, I stood with my hands on my hips, breathing in the sweet air this high up and gazing down at the mountain. What a view.

I'd used the map Jessica had made me of some of the running trails nearby, selecting a doozy this morning. I hadn't run since I left Philadelphia, and my muscles weren't happy about it. Matter of fact, they were livid, and they chanted as I ran up the trail:

Pizza

Cheeseburger

Pizza

Pizza

Beer

Cheeseburger

Worth it?

Worth it?

"Totally," I muttered, kicking my leg back and giving it a good stretch, leaning against a tree trunk for balance. I'd run in the state park, up into the headlands. The Pacific spanned the entirety of my field of vision, mixing with the Big River as it emptied into the ocean. Named for the redwoods that stood along its banks when this part of California was being settled, the Big River played a role not only in the development of the land, but in the gold rush and the timber rush, the majestic giants being cut down for the great building expansion. Now protected, it was a beautiful river, popular with canoers and kayakers.

Not a bad idea, I thought, wondering if there was a canoe hidden away somewhere in the house. It was certainly possible. After my meeting with Mr. Montgomery, I spent the rest of the afternoon and evening finishing up in the second bedroom, and beginning to tackle the third. There were items of a more personal nature in that room, letters and postcards that Maude had accumulated over a lifetime. I also found tax records and old bills of sale in an ancient accordion file, amazingly orderly. These would come in handy if I ended up staying and-

Of course you're staying. Was there really ever any doubt?

I chewed at my thumbnail, contemplating. I was staying.

A bubble of laughter made its way up my throat and out of my mouth before I could even stop it, one after another, until I sounded like a hyena on top of this mountain.

"I'm staying!" I said out loud, listening to the words fill the space. "Cool!"

I fist pumped, whirled about to run back down the mountain, and crashed into a sweaty chest.

My fist flew out again by instinct, right into the nose of Mr. Clark Barrow.

He staggered backward with a moan, his hands flying up to his face. "Good lord, Vivian!" he yelled, blood beginning to appear.

"Fuck! Clark! What the hell!" I yelled back, grabbing his arms and trying to peel his hands back from his nose so I could take a look. "Are you crazy? Sneaking up behind someone like that? Here, sit down so I can check your nose," I said, taking him by the elbow and pushing him down onto a boulder.

"Are you crazy? You were talking to yourself on top of a mountain. Don't do that-ow!" he said as I pried his fingers apart. I'd seen several broken noses in my time-softball, field hockey, you name it.

Fuck, I was talking to myself on top of a mountain. Dammit. "Okay, I was, but-oh hold still, will you?" I finally succeeded in pulling his hands back and getting a good look at what I'd done. Yup. I'd socked him a good one. Shit. "We need to get you to a doctor; I think it's broken."

"Oh, you think so?" he asked angrily, glaring at me.

He started to get up, and I leaned in. "Let me help you."

"You'd help me right off a cliff," he snapped, pulling away from me.

"Oh, would you settle down, just let me help you," I snapped back, turning him back down the trail, instead of higher up like he was heading. I pulled off my T-shirt and folded it into a square pad. "Here, hold this on your nose."

He looked at me, bare on top except for my sports bra, and his eyes widened. Raising an eyebrow, I looked back at him. As he held the T-shirt to his nose, I checked him out fully. Long and lean, he'd been running in just shorts. By the looks of it, he'd been a runner for a long time. And maybe doing some crunches and push-ups too. His body was strong, defined but not overly so. He had a small patch of hair on his chest, that led down a bit to his, ahem, shorts area. He had runner's legs, powerful and tanned. In fact, his whole body was tanned now that I looked at it. And I was looking at it.

Damn, Clark. I'd had no idea a tweed jacket could conceal so much awesome. But this awesome was also the same guy trying to stop me at every turn, so I squelched the staring after getting just one more good eyeful.

"Impossible woman," he muttered, his voice muffled by the wadded-up T-shirt.

"This impossible woman is going to help you now, okay, Clark? Why don't you put your arm around me and just-and that was my boob. Let's try this again?" I grimaced as I gripped him around the waist. His skin was so warm.

As we hiked back down the trail, he grumbled the entire time. I grumbled back, my face red from the exertion. Clark was a tall guy, and he was heavier than he looked.

My face heated more.

At the bottom of the trail he pronounced himself capable of driving to the doctor's on his own, and that if it was broken, I would be paying any medical bills.

I followed him to the urgent-care clinic in town. Once I'd deposited an in-pain-and-getting-crabbier-by-the-minute Clark there, I headed for my house. Now that I'd decided I was indeed staying, the logistics set in.

How to do this? Could I afford it? And when the hell could I get rid of this stupid putt-putt rental car and start driving a real one?

The first thing I needed to do was to tell my parents and see if my father was still interested in buying me out. Which he would be, so it was time to make his day.

I was glad Simon and Caroline would arrive today. I needed to know where I stood with the house and what they, and specifically Caroline, thought I would need to do to it. And of course, run everything by Clark.

Clark of the broken nose, angry eyes, and washboard abs. Who would have thunk it? Not me. And speaking of washboard abs, as I turned into the driveway of my house, I saw Hank's big truck parked there. I looked down at myself, half naked, trail dirty, and a bit bloody, and realized that this guy had never seen me at my best. Ah, well, wasn't going to be today either.

Pulling myself out of the car, I headed toward the barn, where I could hear the faint rustling of hay. He must be feeding Paul and Paula. Internally wincing at how terrible those names were, I poked my head around the corner carefully, not wanting to get hit with a mouthful of hay again.

I looked in, then up, and there he was. Once more, with the pitchfork and the awesome. Once more, with the no shirt and the hot. Once more, with the stunning curve of his spine as it dipped toward the small of his back, each vertebrae carefully selected and placed into position by the hand of God, or at least someone with a sense of divine proportion. Vertebrae. Mmm.

"Hey," I called out. He didn't even turn, which was okay. I could indulge in some more back p**n .

"It is," he answered in a bored voice.

"No, I meant ... oh boy." I walked farther in, sunbeams pouring through the space between the old barn boards, illuminating the golden strands of hay, making the entire space glow. He was glowing to be sure, his skin tanned a deep and outdoorsy bronze, slick with sweat and promise. I wondered if my skin would slip against his, or would it create just enough friction to set fire to everything in between.

I had a sudden vision of being thrown down on a cushiony pillow of hay, one strand in his mouth as he lazily drove into me, his jaw tight and clenched. Not only on the hayseed, but in order to contain his words of love and devotion, the honey-laced poems he'd undoubtedly been creating in his mind ever since I had the nerve to blow into his town, his world, and make him change his mind about anything and everything he'd ever believed in. He'd kept silent, keeping his devotion to himself, until this day, when the sight of my body overwhelmed his stoic nature, his steely constitution to resist me. Today, the ravaging would begin.

I waited expectantly. And waited. And waited some more. He literally stood there with his back to me, shoveling hay, knowing I was there. This onion was going to be harder to peel than I thought. Just as I was about to turn around and head back to the house, he finally threw down his pitchfork and turned toward me.

"What happened to the other guy?" he asked, starting for the ladder. His top half disappeared for a moment, giving me the chance to admire his equally tantalizing bottom half.

"Mmm?" I asked, my jaw falling open as my gaze caught on the deep indentation on either side of his heavenly carved abdominal muscles. He jumped the last few rungs, landing gracefully. He closed the distance between us, his eyes traveling over my smaller frame. A breeze blew in from one end of the barn, a kiss of sea air on my somewhat naked skin. T-shirt abandoned earlier for the cause of Clark, my skin now pebbled. Because of the wind? Or the proximity of the cowboy?

I shifted my weight, leaning forward as he approached. His eyes lingered on my sports bra, and he let his fingertips follow. Dragging one across my collarbone, he touched my skin, then curled underneath the strap. "I assume this is someone else's blood. Were you brawling before breakfast?" he asked, stringing more words than he'd uttered to me in our entire lifetimes together. He had an expression on his face that I could only classify as ... amusement?

"Brawling?" I asked, barely breathing.

"I assume you won, right?"

"I. Was. Running," I stammered, his nearness scrambling my brain and turning me into Forrest Gump.

Confusion crossed his face, and he stepped back a bit. I stepped forward, not wanting to widen the space between us. "I accidentally punched someone. On a mountain."

I cursed my brain and my inability to string together coherent sentences when this cowboy was near. Seriously, it was like I turned into a different person when alone with him.

"Like I said, brawling before breakfast." He winked (he winked!) and moseyed toward the barn door. And he was supremely qualified to bust out a mosey.

"How'd you know I won?" I asked, testing out my own mosey as I followed him.

He turned, leaning against the door, one arm over his head. Beef. To the motherfucking. Cake.

"You look like you can take care of yourself. That's why."

He moseyed away. I sneezed a dozen times.

Had I peeled away a layer? Perhaps not, but I'd certainly scratched through that papery brown skin on the outside.

I sneezed one more time, then headed for the shower.

After my shower I put on my robe and wrapped a towel around my hair, then curled up on the bed for a few minutes to collect my thoughts.

The idea of selling my company to my father had always felt like selling out. I'd created it, I managed it, I made a great living with it. On my own. But over the last year or so, I'd been longing to do something new. I couldn't identify what that new thing was, just that it wasn't in computers.

Now, my company was a means to an end. Not only that, it was the right means to an end. I knew it would be in good hands, and that it would give me the freedom to start my something new out there, whatever that meant. I had some ideas though, one in particular that was just starting to bubble away back there, hiding behind practical thoughts. I'd put a pin in it for now.

Curling my feet underneath me, I looked at my phone, simultaneously dreading and looking forward to this call. I scrolled through until I found Dad Office, and called my father. His secretary put me through.

"Peanut! How are you?"

"Hey, Dad," I replied, rolling my eyes at the nickname as I always did. Secretly? I loved it. The nickname, no, but that I had a nickname.

"How's it out there in granola land?"

"It's pretty cool, actually. There's a restaurant in town that has a cheesesteak on the menu-but on whole wheat bread!"

"Blasphemous," he intoned gravely.

"That's exactly what I said!" We both laughed. I filled him in on the details of my trip so far, knowing that my mother had already likely given him a full report, but also knowing that my dad liked to hear it directly from me. After a few minutes, he asked how long I was planning on staying.

"Well, actually, that's what I was calling to talk to you about. I think I'm staying."

He sighed. "You think so, huh?"

"I do."

He sighed again. "And what are you planning on doing with your business?"

I took a deep breath. "Actually, that's the reason I'm calling. Still interested in buying it?"

"Wow. You really are staying out there."

We were both quiet. I swallowed hard around the surprising lump in my throat.

"Okay, let's talk terms here, what were you thinking?" he said briskly, all business.

After twenty minutes or so we had the beginning of an agreement. Several stipulations of course, and pending an independent review of my books and balance sheets, but the initial number put forth was well in line not only to cover the changes I'd need to make to the property, but to help me really make a new life out here.

It was more of a relief than I thought it'd be. No one had signed on a dotted line yet of course, but all signs were leading that way. I'd be on my own, more money in the bank, and an entirely new life ahead of me.

Almost three thousand miles away from my family.

That dratted lump rose once more in my throat, making me cough a bit. My eyes were stinging a little as well. Fanning myself, I made to get off the call.

"So, let's talk about this again in a few days, huh? Let this sit a bit," he said, his own voice a little gruff.

"Good idea."

"Your mother and I are talking about coming out there soon to see you. When might be a good time?"

"You guys can come out whenever you want, you know that." I sniffed a bit. Argh.

"Well, I'll let you and your mother plan those details. Be glad to see you, Peanut," he said.

"You too, Dad."

We hung up and I stayed on the bed for a few minutes. Almost thirty years old, a woman who'd owned her own business for years, and my father could still make me feel three feet tall in the very best of ways. I tugged the towel off my head, my now-dry hair sticking out in all directions like I'd been electrocuted. Wiping off my face, I looked at the time and realized I needed to kick it into high gear. I scrambled off the bed and went to get myself in some kind of order.

I had company coming.

I stood in the doorway, watching for Simon's car. They were due any minute. Caroline had texted me when they hit the edge of town, and as I bounced from foot to foot I realized I was anxious. Anxious for them to get there, anxious for them to see my new house. It was a good feeling, welcoming someone into your home. And even though it had only been my home for a few days, with lots of work to be done, I was eager to show it off a bit.

Walking the length of the front porch and back again, I saw a twinkle of headlights down at the bottom of the driveway. And soon, an old Range Rover was parked in front of the house, with four of the best-looking people I'd ever seen spilling out onto the crushed gravel. Seriously, it was like watching the opening credits on a TV series.

A couple I guessed to be Mimi and Ryan came from the backseat. She was shorter than I was, and I was used to being the shortest in most rooms. Tiny and petite, she had flawless golden skin and shiny black hair. She held hands with Ryan, who was tall and lean with curly blond hair. It was longish, pushed behind his ears, and green eyes danced behind horn-rim glasses. It did not escape my attention that when Mimi dashed in front of him, he clearly checked out her ass.

That right there said a lot about this couple. Even if you missed the enormous sparkly ring on her left hand.

And climbing out of the front of the Range Rover was one of my favorite people on the planet, Simon Parker. Dark hair, chiseled jaw, he was the kind of handsome everyone agreed on. No matter your type, no matter your preference, Simon had that generally agreed upon kind of good looks. And charm. A charm I was immune to romantically speaking, and always had been. But even though we had only ever been good friends, I could still appreciate a gorgeous guy. And speaking of gorgeous, his girlfriend was tall and slim and blond and stunning. The kind of girl you wanted to dislike on sight, but then she opened her mouth and she won you over. Funny, a girl's girl, she could hold her own with Handsome over there, and that was something most women couldn't do. Points for that in my book.

"Hey, Parker."

"Hey, Franklin," he said, catching me into a close hug. I patted his backside and winked at Caroline over his shoulder. I saw Mimi shoot her a glance, and Caroline just waved her off. More points. She knew she had nothing to worry about.

"Quite the spread you've got here, Viv," he said, setting me down and taking in the view.

"Speaking of spread, what's up, homeboy?" I laughed, patting his stomach. He smoothed his T-shirt over his still very flat tummy.

"It's my girl. She bakes me pie. All the time." He winked at Caroline, and she blushed.

"I hear you, there's a pizza in this town that's as good as Tony's back home. I've been eating it way too much," I said, pulling up my own shirt and smacking my still-flat tummy. "Want to run tomorrow?"

"Yeah, sure, that'd be great. I brought my bike too. There's supposed to be some great trails near here. Have you had a chance to check any of them out?"

"Nah, don't have my bike out here yet, I need to-Christ, where are my manners?" I asked, turning around as Simon and I were halfway up the steps. Caroline, Ryan, and Mimi were standing in a semicircle in the driveway, grinning up at our retreat toward the house. I ran back down the steps, reaching out to hug Caroline.

"Girl, I'm a terrible host. How the hell are you?"

"Great, now that I'm here. I'm dying to see this house! And of course, you know, you too." She smiled, swatting me on the butt as she caught up to Simon.

"And you must be Mimi and Ryan, nice to meet you!" I said, shaking both their hands. Ryan started to say something, but Mimi was nearly bursting out of her skin.

"I heard a rumor that when you inherited this house, it was filled with all kinds of things! Things and stuff and very unorganized, is that right?" she asked, dancing from one foot to the other.

"Um, well, yeah, that's true. I've gotten some of the bedrooms upstairs started but there's still junk everywhere and-"

"Yes! Yes! Yes!" she chanted, pumping her fist in the air and skipping up the steps, almost plowing Caroline over in her haste to get inside the house.

"She on the crack?" I asked her fiance, who laughed out loud.

"She's a professional organizer. Your house will be like crack to her."

"Then she's going to need rehab after this," I warned, leading him and the rest of his friends inside. Where Mimi had already gone. Where she was turning circles, cheeks already pink with excitement over the stacks and piles crying out for attention. And someone with a tool belt full of labels and black Sharpies.

Once inside, I had this sudden sense of ... unease? Shame? I saw the house the way I did that first day, so full of clutter and crap. And now that there were people in it, my default reaction was almost embarrassment, like I was the one who had done this. I could only imagine how Aunt Maude had felt, if she was overwhelmed with all this stuff and had no clue where to start.

But they all seemed to take everything in stride. The guys went immediately to the back window, looking out at the view and exclaiming over the height of the waves. But the girls were staring, wonder apparent in their expressions. That made me happy.

Mimi was back to bouncing, her eyes lighting on every pile, every stack, every opportunity to restore order and balance. Caroline was taking in every detail, every spindly thingie, every woodwork dealio. Every knickknack that looked old and original, she'd zeroed in on it immediately.

"Viv, this house is incredible," she breathed, running her fingers down the intricately carved bannister.

"Right? I spent a summer out here when I was a kid, and I never forgot it," I replied, scooping up an errant tube sock and putting it back into the bag it'd jumped from. "The house isn't quite how I remember it, but it still has the feel, you know?"

"Can I see the rest?" she asked, and Mimi popped her head around the corner from the dining room.

"Yeah, can we see the rest?" she echoed, holding one of the Johnny Mathis records.

"Of course, come on," I replied, waving the boys forward as we headed into the kitchen. And as I walked them through the house, they all reacted differently to different things.

Caroline almost had to be hosed down when she saw the stove. "There's a vintage Magic Chef stove? Are you kidding me?"

Mimi almost bounced her little feet right off when she saw the stacks and stacks of old Life magazines. "These go back to the forties, like the 1940s!"

They all had the standard response to the legless knight-"weird"-and the claw-foot tub-"awesome!" The girls were reduced to dreamy sighs when they saw my bedroom and the view I woke up to every morning. The breeze was blowing off the Pacific today, the water calm and the bluest blue. Lacy curtains flapped in the window, freshly laundered and white as snow. All this room needed now was a coat of paint and-

"We should do a creamy ivory on the walls, accented by this stunning woodwork, which will need to be restored of course. We can pick up the deep green from this quilt and create some custom throw pillows, and I'm thinking a deep plush rug, the kind you lose your slippers in. And then over the bed we can-"

"Babe, easy," Simon said, slipping his arms around Caroline's waist as she spun every which way in the room, clearly seeing an entirely new room in her head. She turned beet red, looking my way.

"I'm so sorry, it's just a house like this, with this much natural beauty, it's amazing, Viv. Truly amazing," she said, smiling genuinely at me.

"It is amazing, I'm glad you think so. But it needs a shit ton of work or it will literally fall down around my ears," I replied. "You should see how much the roof leaks, or the rotten wood on the porch, or the world of scary that's in the basement. I'm scared to death to turn the boiler on once it gets chilly at night. It's like The Shining down there! And wait till you see how bad the-"

"Yeah yeah yeah, we'll get to all that. That's what I'm here for. For now, we just want to enjoy the weekend and your new house. This is so exciting!" Caroline said, reaching out and squeezing my shoulder. She had a strong grip. Simon must be happy. "And I want to hear all about this librarian."

I laughed, escorted everyone back down the stairs and into the kitchen, where I had cold beer, wine, and snacks waiting. We all grabbed something to drink and nibble on, and ended up on the back porch, each nestled into our own rocking chairs. Watching the breakers roll in and the chickens scratch around, I entertained my first guests.

After having a few drinks, we decided to walk into town rather than drive to get some dinner. It was a gorgeous night out, the sunset a perfect backdrop for a stroll. And as we walked, two couples plus me, I was struck with a sudden sense of longing. Not for a roll in the hay; not for a quickie up against a barn door, although those thoughts were tantalizing I'll admit. No, tonight I was longing to be part of a couple out for a stroll.

I wanted to have the easy comfort of a lingering hand on my waist, a gentle touch on the back of my neck, a whispered word. A hand to hold. I loved my romance novels, loved the passion and the chase. But the part I loved the most? Was when the hero took his woman into his arms and kissed her reverently.

Sigh.

I kicked absently at the gravel as we walked into town, the group's easy laughter bringing me back to the present. Where I had new friends and one old, albeit three hours away. I saw the lights of John's twinkling in the distance, and my mouth watered. Pizza.

As it turns out, Mimi's parents have a house in Mendocino, so she was familiar not only with John's the restaurant, but with John himself.

"Mimi! How you doin', kid?" John called out from behind the bar, waving us all over. "Your parents were up here a few weeks ago, they told me all about your wedding plans in San Francisco. Sounds like it's going to be some kind of epic event." He came out to greet us, exclaiming an "oof" when Mimi launched herself at the burly linebacker of a guy.

"John, this is Ryan, my fiance," she gushed, linking her arm through John's and grinning at both of them. The two shook hands, and introductions were made all around.

"So how do you know this one?" he asked Mimi, jerking his thumb toward me.

"Just met her today actually, but these two go way back," she answered, pointing at Simon and me.

"Viv, the usual?" John asked, leading us all to a corner table.

"I don't know that I've been coming here long enough to have a usual, have I?" I asked, looking over the menu. "Although I am dreaming of pizza ..."

"Butcher Block?" Mimi asked, and I nodded. "Yeah, let's get two of those. Large. And a couple of pitchers of beer, whatever's on tap tonight," she instructed. Everyone looked at one another, and then nodded. Pizza and beer all around.

The jukebox was going, the place was packed, the food was amazing, and the beer flowed. Ryan was fascinating to talk to, both smart and funny. Simon told me stories all about his latest travels and Caroline described the renovation they had just completed on their new home in Sausalito. And the adventures of their new feline family they'd inherited. And Mimi? Mimi was a trip. She knew half the people in the bar, from family vacations over the years. And when Jessica stopped by after she closed down the restaurant she found herself at the table as well with a beer in hand after Mimi literally pulled her off her feet and sat her down with us.

After days of near solitude, I felt almost overwhelmed. Just a touch. I grabbed my purse and headed up to the jukebox to take a breather while I picked some new tunes. A dance floor opened up out back behind the restaurant, along with additional seating for when it was this crowded. I studied the list of songs, made a few selections, and was just putting my quarters in when I felt a tickle in my nose. Turning, I spied one Mr. Hank Higgins perched on a barstool, the luckiest bottle of beer poised between his lips.

I watched as his tongue licked at his full lips, catching a drop. I watched as he ran his fingers up and down the long neck of the bottle, stroking it absently. I watched as his hand closed around the top, twisting ever so slightly before returning for the downstroke. And I watched as he cupped the nuts from below, holding them in his giant man hands.

Did I forget to mention they were cashews? From the bowl on the bar? Aw yeah.

"Pretty sure the jukebox won't work when there's drool in between the buttons," someone said in my ear, and I whirled around. Jessica stood there, silently laughing.

"Ass," I said, pushing past her and leaning against the other end of the bar. From this spot, I could still admire the cashews.

"He's just a guy," she urged. "Talk to him, don't talk to him-he's still just a guy."

I ran my hand through my hair in frustration. Tonight for once I wasn't wearing sneakers and covered in dust. I was clad in an oversized men's black button-down with a piece of rope belting it in the middle; it was a short dress on me. And in place of my combat boots, I'd worn sandals tonight. Laced up to my knees, they showed off my short but powerful legs. And my black button-down was artfully unbuttoned. Was I showing off some cleave? Yes'm. Could you see the edge of my black lacy bra? Yes'm. Was I looking fairly fetching tonight? Fuck yes'm.

Perhaps this was the night, the night I'd make him notice me as more than just a sneezer. I peered down the bar; he was still there. With his nuts. I could do this.

I handed her my purse, which she took with a murmured "Get it, girl."

I sauntered down toward him, putting an extra swish and sway into my hips. Something about leading with the hips makes a girl feel a little more sexy, a little more grrr. One of the songs I selected came on the jukebox, Al Green's Can't Get Next to You. I walked in time with the music, catching the eye of a bartender and tossing him a flirtatious and cheeky grin. He smiled back instantly, eyes appreciative of my perky perks. And was it me, or had the lighting changed? Darker, smokier, smudgier ...

"Grease fire is out!" was the call from the kitchen, but no matter. The smoke and the smudge gave an exotic feel to this neighborhood bar, this watering hole, this ... opium den.

The princess looked out across the sea of suitors, knowing that all eyes were on her. Her skin prickled, knowledge that he was in the room something that her body knew on a primordial level. Banners of silk hung low from the ceiling, fans paddled lazy air, swirling the heavy scent of myrrh and sandalwood thickly on the night breeze. And another scent, light at first but intensifying as she made her way through the men. The men, all there to woo and win her heart, but there was only one she wanted. And not just in her heart, she wanted him in her heat. Her secret female heat, the heat that only he would ever be privy to.

And then, he was there. The crowds parted, and he was revealed to her. Tall, crushingly handsome, he walked with a hunger in his eyes and power between his thighs. Dark, dangerous, and instantly assessing, he found her. And found her wanting. And panting. He found her wanting and panting and-

Blonde. Boobs. Big boobs. Tall. Blonde. Big blonde with boobs. While I was contemplating his nuts, he'd been contemplating the size-four sweater on the size-six girl who had plastered herself to his side. Bursting with enthusiasm was the kindest way to describe her.

I tried to make a course correction, not easy when you're midsaunter, and went right into the path of-

"This is getting just plain stupid, Clark," I said, when I ran right into his elbow patch. He lowered his to-go box and glared at me-as well as he could, with two black eyes. Purple and gray bloomed on either side of his nose, hidden by a butterfly bandage and some tape. He was dressed a little less formally tonight, a T-shirt underneath his tweed jacket. Huh. Clark Casual.

"Oh, I'm so sorry, does it hurt a lot?" I asked, reaching up to-Wait, what the hell was I reaching up to do? Luckily, he dodged my hand.

"Please don't touch, Vivian. One trip to the clinic is enough for one day, don't you think?" He looked around. "What are you doing here?"

"Having dinner with some friends. You?"

"Just picking up some dinner myself," he said, shuffling his dinner in his hands so he could push his glasses up on his nose. Which must have been habit, since he wasn't wearing them. Due to his injury? He winced when he touched it, and almost dropped his pizza box. "I gotta go," he muttered, and started for the door.

"Look, Clark. Stay. Let me buy you a drink. It's the least I can do for breaking your nose."

"In point of fact, it's not actually broken. Just incredibly bruised," he said.

I sighed. "Does it hurt?"

"Like you wouldn't believe."

"Then drinks are on me. Come on," I insisted, gently taking him by the elbow and steering him toward the table. Over his shoulder I glimpsed the cowboy and the boobs about to head out the front door. She was giggling. He was cocksure. He was also looking over his shoulder at me. And when he made eye contact, he grinned. Ass. And what a fine one it was ...

Another missed opportunity. And I so rarely wore dresses. Ah, well.

"Everyone, this is Clark. Clark, this is everyone. Except you already know Jessica," I announced, pulling an extra chair over to the table and plunking him down while taking my purse back from her. She raised an eyebrow as if to ask if I'd made any headway with the cowboy, and I shook my head.

"Clark! What happened to you?" Jessica exclaimed, whisking his pizza box out of his hands and depositing it on a neighboring table while she fussed over him. The people at the table said thank-you and started to open it up. I nabbed it right back and set it behind me.

"It's fine, just a little accident. No big deal," he said, catching my glance and now my questioning eyebrow. He shrugged, shaking hands all around and meeting everyone.

"It looks terrible, does it hurt?" Jessica asked, leaning over and raising her hand. Before I could tell her stop, and that he didn't want anyone touching it, she softly touched his cheek, then patted him on the shoulder. He didn't flinch, he didn't tell her not to do it, he just let her.

So it was me he didn't want touching him. Well, no big surprise there. After all, I was the one who'd socked him.

"It hurts some, but I've got some painkillers, so I'm all set," he replied.

"Well, if you've got painkillers then let's get you something soft to drink. I bet you drink Perrier, right, Clark?" I teased, waving over our waitress.

He rolled his eyes. "I live three blocks away, I think I'll make it home okay." Instead of Perrier he ordered, "Scotch. Water. Neat."

My eyes widened. That was my drink. When the waitress asked if anyone else wanted another round, I told her I'd have the exact same thing. Clark shrugged out of his jacket and I got another glance of tanned arms. Not popping out of his T-shirt like a meathead, but muscular nonetheless. And speaking of his T-shirt, it was covered in letters and numbers. As I peered closer, I realized it was the-

"Drake equation! Nice to see a fellow math nerd," Ryan exclaimed, reaching over for a fist bump. Looking cautious but pleased to be doing it, Clark fist bumped back. A tentative smile on his face, he appeared to relax a bit. As relaxed as someone with a butterfly bandage could be.

"What's the Drake equation?" Caroline asked.

I said, "It's an algebraic equation that calculates the possibility of not only the existence of alien life, but also postulates their ability to be radio-communicative." I took a bite of my pizza. "Mmmm."

I realized it was quiet at the table when I heard Clark let out a very small but still audible whimper. His nose must be hurting. I looked at the rest of the table, and saw all the girls smiling at me, while Ryan and Simon just looked impressed.

"What?" I asked. "I hate it when everyone assumes that because I have tits, I can't recognize something as simple as the Drake equation."

Did I enjoy changing people's perceptions of me? Me, with the piercings and the tattoos? Yup. Did I hate that people made assumptions about me? Yup.

Just as I was about to share this little nugget of Viv insight with the table, Caroline jostled Clark while reaching for her purse just enough that he bumped into me, his face turning toward mine in apology.

His eyes met mine and I noticed that what I'd mistakenly thought were the same boring brown eyes as Tom, Dick, and Harry were instead the exact color of rich dark chocolate, flecked with gold and a hint of green. I'd never noticed them before, what with the dusty glasses and the lecturing me about the house.

Dark chocolate was supposed to be good for you, right?

But I didn't want good for you. I wanted bad for you-a passionate tryst, feelings and desires and things that were dirty and naughty and taboo. I mean, except for that one thing that seemed to be so popular these days. No one, not even the cowboy, was getting anywhere near my-

"Back door?" Clark asked.

"Excuse me?" I spluttered, choking on my Scotch. How did he, wait, did I say-

"I left you a note on your back door, about coming by tomorrow. Are you all right?" he asked, as I continued to choke a bit. "You really shouldn't order Scotch if you can't handle it-but most people can't drink it straight like this. Shall I get you some soda?"

"I'm fine, I'm fine. Just went down the wrong pipe, that's all." I grimaced, gulping down some water. "You left me a note?"

"Yes, Vivian. I was able to dig up some of the original plans for the house. I can bring them by tomorrow if you like. I thought you might need them if you insist on proceeding with your changes."

"Wait. Whoa. You want to bring me something that could actually help me?" I asked, a wry smile on my face.

"As opposed to what? Hurt you?" he asked, a hint of a grin on his lips. He pointed to his nose.

"Touche."

I clinked his glass, and he downed his drink. Damn.

"I should get going, my pizza's going to get cold. Lovely to meet you all. Vivian, I'll see you tomorrow then?"

"Call me Viv and you got it," I replied. He gave me a puzzled look, then said his good-nights to the table. A moment after he left, Mimi and Caroline leaned in.

"Tomorrow? You just got to town and you already have a date? Nice work," Caroline said, Mimi nodding her head excitedly.

"With Clark? Oh no, you got it all wrong. He's the librarian."

"He's the librarian?" they said in unison, and I shushed them immediately. He hadn't even made it to the door, for pity's sake.

"They don't make librarians like that where I come from," Mimi said.

"Me either," piped up Caroline.

"They don't make them like that anywhere. That's just part of why our little town is so fantastic," Jessica added, and we all leaned out of our chairs just enough to watch him walking out of the bar, elbow patches glowing in the moonlight.

"He's cute," I allowed, sipping my Scotch. "But you'll see the other side. You'll see it tomorrow, when he picks a fight with me about some corner piece or whozit that he thinks must be restored and never thrown away, or the entire history of the world will be threatened by this one teeny tiny scrolly looking piece of bullshit I am trying to throw away in order to clean up my house and put it somewhat in order, but nooooo. No. Clark must save it-he must save it all."

My voice may have gotten higher and a wee bit more shrill toward the end of my diatribe, because Simon and Ryan stopped talking. As did the three tables on either side of us.

I looked at them, then downed the rest of my Scotch. "So, tomorrow?"

By the time we finished dinner, walked back to the house, and enjoyed cookies on the back porch, everyone was reasonably sober and ready to call it a day. I packed them into their car and thanked them for coming down, and we made plans for them to come back after breakfast in the morning. As they left for Mimi's family's vacation house, I reread the note I did indeed find from Clark on my back door. And if I didn't think it possible for someone to be uptight in a note, I now did.

Vivian-

In spite of what occurred this morning, I still feel it my duty to advise you on your restoration project. While I am opposed to a complete and total overhaul, I can see how there are some aspects of the home's deterioration that may seem untenable to you. Therefore, I have some suggestions that may help to guide you in your efforts. I can return tomorrow morning with the original plans. Please call me at your earliest convenience.

Regards,

Clark Barrow

Come on. Regards? And it was on embossed stationary. Embossed! With Mendocino Historical Society at the top-as if I could forget for one second whom he represented.

And what was this? At the bottom, his phone number?

I dialed it without thinking. It rang twice, then he answered.

"Clark Barrow."

Christ, he answered the phone with his full name?

"Hi, Clark Barrow, it's Viv Franklin."

"Vivian? What a surprise," he said, his voice deeper than I remembered it. Must be the phone. "To what do I owe the pleasure?"

The pleasure. Ooooo, that deep voice. The-why did I call him?

"I got your note, and yes, I'd like your assistance."

"I thought we'd established that over Scotch, Vivian," he murmured. His voice was deeper than usual. Thick. Not slurred, just ... heavy.

"We never actually said for sure if you were coming."

"If I'm coming?" he asked, and I pressed my hand against my cheek. Did it feel hot?

"Tomorrow. If you're coming tomorrow. Over here."

"Oh yes. Tomorrow." He chuckled. "Sure. If you want me."

Hmm. Nighttime Clark is very different from Daytime Clark.

"Sure. Great. At 10 a.m.?" I managed, my head reeling a bit.

"Perfect."

"Okay," I said, then waited. "Bye?"

"Night, Vivian."

I hung up the phone, shook my head, then shook it again. I went upstairs, crawled under the quilt, and thought about Scotch. Water. Neat. And Regards.

Chapter seven

Vivian stood in the doorway, luminous and radiant, lit from behind like an angel. But her thoughts were the furthest from pure. She refused to turn, even when she heard him approach. His footsteps, sure and strong, rang out as he walked toward her. Each step echoed as loudly as her heartbeat, which she was sure he could hear.

He stood just behind her now, close enough that she could feel the warmth from his body reaching out to caress her, a promise of what was to come when he finally laid his hands on her. Yet just the promise was driving her out of her skin, out of her mind, and practically out of her clothes. Her gown of silk was soft to the touch, but right now it was simply a barrier, confining her when she longed to be naked and free.

Reason? Rules? Order? All disappeared with each breath at the nape of her neck, intoxicating and wanton. She twisted in the doorway, not turning to see but to feel, her body changing into something mindless, only capable of feeling whatever he was going to do to her.

And whatever it was, she would let him. She was his.

His hands hovered at her waist, his strong hands wrapping low on her hips, his skin burning and branding her like none had before. When he pulled her against him she could feel how she'd affected him, how her curves alone had made him hard with lust for her.

"Vivian," he breathed into her ear, lips brushing just below and making her shiver and moan.

His hands slipped across her silk to her navel, tracing a path below her full br**sts, made heavier by the second as they grew more full in anticipation of his touch. Her ni**les hardened in excitement, straining against the silk. She arched into his hands, pressing her body back against his, flush and barely contained. He groaned heavy in her ear, and she shuddered.

"Vivian," he said once more, and she began to turn toward him. She had to see him, had to see his face-this lover she had ached for for far too long.

Lightning flashed and thunder rolled as the elements echoed her excitement at finally knowing his touch. She turned, she turned more, and-

Crash!

I woke up on the floor, covered in sweat and tangled in sheets, blankets, and a very thick quilt. My heart was racing, and no wonder. I'd had one of the most erotic dreams ever; my mind was still full of the images conjured by my subconscious.

Subconscious Viv was extremely horny. Something Conscious Viv could appreciate as well.

I struggled to get out of the cocoon, finally pushing everything down and shimmying out the top. Crawling back on top of the bed, I leaned over and pushed back the curtains, the dawn just beginning to creep into the sky. I looked at the clock. Not quite 5 a.m. Ugh.

I looked forward to the day when I was on California time. I looked forward to the day that I could sleep through the night. I especially looked forward to the day when my sex dreams were replaced by actual sex.

I leaned back in bed against the pillows. Occasionally I had dreams where I cast myself in my own romance novel, brought about no doubt by reading a few chapters of The Wolf of Lust Street the night before.

But unlike the romance novels where I could always see the hero so clearly in my head, when I dreamed, it was always a dark lover I could never quite see. A suggestion of full lips, strong jaw, giant c**k of course-but I could never see his face.

Pulling the quilt from the floor, I curled into myself like a roly-poly, pushing thoughts of dark faceless lovers from my head. In the light of day, a faceless lover was actually creepy, not sexy.

Except for the giant cock. Who needed the face when they had that?

Unless that face was buried between my lusty thighs ...

Get a grip, Viv!

Yeah, a grip of that hair as I hold him in place while he ...

Without a face, there'd be no mouth. Without a mouth, there'd be no tongue.

I'll concede the point.

Did all heroines have entire conversations with themselves inside their head? This is why I could never be a romance novel heroine. Insanity precludes it.

I went downstairs to make myself some breakfast. I was determined to start cooking for myself, but the Magic Chef stove that Caroline was so enamored of was clunky, old-fashioned, and a pain in the ass. You couldn't just turn it on and cook. Nope. You had to light it, jiggle the handle, then coax the flame out-and if you didn't pass out from the gas fumes before it actually lit, then an hour later, you had boiling water. Which made no sense at all, gas stoves were usually incredibly efficient. Something must be clogged somewhere, something was dirty or just plain old and busted. Which seemed to be the theme here.

I also was determined to make my own coffee. The percolator had met with an unfortunate accident when it was thrown across the backyard, almost beheading a chicken. It now lived in the garage. I'd found an old French press in a jumble of junk in the basement, washed it out several times, and it worked great. So as soon as I had boiling water, I could make coffee. While I waited, I wandered out onto the back porch with a banana, perching in one of the old rockers with my nightgown pulled down over my knees.

I'd never been a morning person, but lately I was finding it one of my favorite parts of the day, even though they were still starting earlier than I liked. Maybe it was still the time change, maybe it was all the fresh air, but I slept hard and fast and woke up ready to start the day.

The sea was quiet today, calm and peaceful. Gulls flew here and there, pelicans flapped lazily then dove like missiles for fish they'd spotted.

I'd thought I'd feel something more ... final about selling my company to my father. I'd buried myself in my work for so long it had become my world. So why wasn't I more broken up over it?

Instead of feeling sad or discouraged or questioning whether I'd done the wrong thing, I felt the complete opposite. I had no idea what I was doing out here, why I wanted to stay, or what I was going to do with this new life. I just knew that I was ... content. I was pleased with this turn my life was taking, and excited by the fact that I didn't know where it was going. It had been a long time since I'd been on an adventure.

Speaking of adventure, my teakettle was whistling. I padded into the kitchen, poured hot water into the pot with my dry oatmeal and into the French press, and started cutting up some fruit. Raspberries, blueberries, and a chunked-up peach went into a bowl with a squeeze of lemon and a sprinkling of sugar. I found I ate more fruit if I made it into a salad.

After finishing up with the fruit, I checked on the oatmeal. Soft. I checked on the coffee. Brewed. Perfect.

Ladling a few spoonfuls of oatmeal into a bowl, I added some of the fruit, a drizzle of honey, a splash of cream, and a sprinkle of cinnamon. I pressed the plunger down on the coffee, watching as the grounds were pressed down and the dark brown coffee was expressed to the top. Pouring some into a cup, I settled into a chair at the old kitchen table. And as I ate, I looked around at the room.

I wasn't a designer by any means, but I knew what I liked. And I'd always been drawn to a more industrial look and feel, something modern and clean. Maybe it was growing up in a house full of boys who were constantly making a mess of everything. Our house was big, sure, but always filled to almost bursting with sports equipment and action figures. Hockey pucks, G.I. Joe towns, and Legos underfoot (which hurt like you wouldn't believe when stepped on barefoot). My mom's charity fund-raising banners and posters, country French decorations, collection of stone turkeys, shadow boxes full of miniatures. Footballs, gym bags, my dad's model cars, homework, paperwork ... A family of eight makes for a lot of stuff. So when I got my own place, I went to the total opposite.

Chrome. Glass. Black leather couch and chairs. Clean lines. Right angles. Hard corners. My home office consisted of four computer monitors and a Lucite table covered with notebooks full of equations. My bed? Platform. Suspended night tables. Inlaid reading lamps. Everything in its place and in order.

They say a home reflects its owner's personality, and Oprah says your home should "rise up to meet you." I just wanted to able to come in, find what I'm looking for, and go about my day.

This house? Seaside Cottage? It rose up to meet you, and said "Hey, whatever you're looking for, I think we've got it. Somewhere. Let me just look in one of these boxes; I bet we can find it."

The clutter, the crap, the chaos-it was too much. However. There was something kind of cozy about it.

Take this kitchen, for instance. Huge, especially considering the age of the home. Usually kitchens in older homes were small and efficient. This one was filled to the brim with "things," but it was cozy. Through the large, sunny window on the back wall you could see the barn and the garage, the flowers out back, and the ocean. The bottom half of the walls were covered in what Caroline said was wainscoting, battered and chipped a bit in places, but it was in pretty good shape. The old butcher-block countertops were covered in cuts and nicks, but I could imagine a hundred-plus years of women gathered here, dicing and chopping and laughing and chatting as they prepared another Thanksgiving dinner. There were three, count them three, blenders on those same counters, none of which worked. But at one point, did they whip up milkshakes for a generation of kiddos running here and there? Was I one of those kiddos?

The floor was scraped and dented linoleum, but I've no doubt that at one point someone had tended and waxed that floor to a polished gleam. The walls were a faded yellow, but covered with cheery vintage posters hawking Gold Medal flour, 20 Mule Team Borax, and Gorton's Frozen Fish Dinners.

It was a home. And juxtaposed against my very neat and orderly place in Philadelphia, my apartment was never a home, I realized. It was just a place I slept.

Pretty heavy thoughts over oatmeal. It was really good oatmeal, though. I dipped up another spoonful.

Aunt Maude may have been on to something. The Legless Knight was clearly pushing it, but perhaps not everything had to be tucked out of sight. Hmm. We'll see.

Enough introspection. I finished my breakfast and got dressed for the day. I was hoping Caroline would have some crazy design idea today where I could smash through a wall or something.

Lingering frustration over that dream?

I said enough introspection.

"So what exactly do you want me to do here today? You keep referring to me as backup; why is that?" Caroline asked as we walked through the house again. Simon and Ryan had dropped the girls off and then headed off to go windsurfing. It killed me that I wasn't out there with them; it was something I'd always wanted to try. Instead I was inside the house on a glorious day like this, talking about floral prints and a settee. But I appreciated the help.

"You're my backup insofar as you're the one who can tell Clark when he's being too much of a pencil pusher. When he needs to just shut up and let me make the changes I want," I explained, tapping my foot.

"And what exactly are those changes?" she asked.

I took a deep breath. Then frowned. Then took another deep breath. Still with the frowning.

Caroline looked amused; I looked like a fish stuck on land and no clue how to breathe.

"I don't know exactly," I admitted. "But it just made me so damn mad that he could come in and tell me I couldn't do something!" I thought back to the first day he came over here, arguing with me about the baluwhatzit. "The truth is, I love this house. I love everything about this house. But it hasn't been updated in years, and if I'm going to live here, it's got to be brought into the modern age. Even the basics are falling apart-the roof is like Swiss cheese. I've been lucky it hasn't rained since that first night, but the next time it does, it's going to pour in here again. And the front porch is rotten- I put my foot through it the night I arrived, and you can feel it when you walk on it."

She nodded. "Yes, I felt it give when I came in today. Well that should be easy enough. He can't expect you to go through the porch floor every time you come home."

"Humpf. We'll see. Hey, where's your friend Mimi?"

"Hmm, she's been awfully quiet since she went upstairs," Caroline mused, walking over to the bottom of the stairs. "Mimi?" she called up.

"Nothing," was the answer.

"Mimi, what are you up to?"

"Nothing," came down again, followed by a thump. "I'm okay!"

"Oh boy, I better go see what she's gotten herself into. I left her alone once in my bathroom, and my lipsticks were alphabetized and color coded within minutes."

As Caroline headed upstairs, I shook my head. Although part of me thought that seemed like a good idea, the two lipsticks I owned were already color coded. Barely There Pink and Knockout Red. Pink for first dates. Red for, well, you know.

Grabbing a broom, I decided to spend a few minutes sweeping up the dust that seemed to come out and do a dance party every night after I went to bed. These floors were so old they literally made their own dust! Sighing, I was bending over sweeping up yet another pile when I heard a sound behind me.

Turning, I saw Clark. Nose bandage, briefcase, hand raised as though he'd been about to knock. And directly behind me, so he had a wonderful view of my posterior.

I stood slowly, wondering which Clark I'd get today. Nighttime Clark or Daytime Clark?

"I'm going to tie a bell around your neck, so you quit sneaking up on me like that," I said, crossing toward the screen door.

"I've got scones. Do you like scones?" he said, lifting the bag so I could see he did indeed have scones.

I laughed in spite of myself, and the grin that spread over his face literally took my breath away. For a moment, he reminded me of someone. I couldn't put my finger on it, and it's a good thing too, because at that very moment I wanted to put my fingers, and hands for that matter, all over-

"Vivian, I do hope you're not planning on removing that mantel-piece. I see that chunk of marble just thrown haphazardly on the floor. Need I remind you that the fireplaces in this home are all original, even down to the tile in the-"

"Oh, Clark, just stuff a scone in it and get in here." I sighed, holding the door open. He set his scones and briefcase down, then inspected the offending piece of marble.

"Oh good, this'll be a simple repair. You really must be more careful when you-"

"Oh, please, it came off in my hand! I literally just leaned up against it when I was on the phone the other day, and-"

"I'd say you don't know your own strength, but based on this"-he pointed at his nose-"I know that's not entirely true."

He wore his glasses today, in spite of the fact that they must hurt.

Get a grip, Viv.

"Would you care for some coffee?" I asked, interrupting some speech about turn-of-the-century architecture. Which always confused me, frankly, because the century had turned twice since people started saying that phrase ... so which century? A question that would not be posed at this moment, however.

His mouth hung open in midrant. I leaned in, pushed his chin up and closed his mouth, then turned for the kitchen. "Follow me, Clark. I hope you like it strong."

He murmured something, but followed me. And for the record? What he murmured?

"Like you wouldn't believe."

So Caroline was here to back me up, to agree with me, to be on my side and to make sure that Clark didn't cause too much trouble-right?

Not so much what happened.

What did happen is the two of them bonded over a bottle cap, a ballroom, and a baluhwhozit.

Things started pretty well. We all agreed that the roof was a no-brainer, especially when I began my prepared speech about how rain coming inside would be doing continued damage to the already damaged living room. Clark didn't disagree, only noting that as long as the original sight lines of the roof were retained, and the copper gutters were replaced, that a new roof was most certainly called for.

We made great strides toward a continued state of detente when we progressed to the front porch, almost re-creating my fall through the floorboards when Caroline pressed a little too hard in her heels. Once again, Clark surprised and impressed me with his ability to compromise. He did put his foot down-and almost through, which couldn't have happened at a better moment, when I suggested that the railing and the cornice thingies were a little too fussy for my taste. Though I loved this house I wanted to put my own stamp on it, even if just in the tiniest of ways. When Clark began to make a stink, Caroline wisely interjected with a suggestion that was period-specific but slightly less Victorian. And in the end, he agreed the changes would look nice on the new front porch.

Things began to unravel when we went upstairs. When Clark leaned on a cabinet in the hallway that I'd been unable to pry open, something came loose. A tug and a push and a pull later, the panel slid upward.

The house had a dumbwaiter, like an elevator for food. Or laundry. Or dolls. When we pulled it up there were several dolls sitting there in suspended psychotic silence. And sitting among the dolls was an old bottle cap.

"Holy crow, this is a Nesbitt's bottle cap! Do you know how old this is?" Clark exclaimed.

"What's a Nesbitt's?" I asked.

"Oh my gosh, I loved Nesbitt's!" Caroline chimed in. "The orange one was my mom's favorite. It got so hard to find, but I remember having it when I was a kid!"

"What's a Nesbitt's?" I asked again.

"Did you ever have the Honey Lemonade?"

"Oh, it's a lemonade company? Like Country Time?" I asked.

"No! I could never find it!" Caroline replied.

The hallway was getting very closed in, and I walked over to stand next to the Legless Knight's legs.

"You can order it online," Clark continued.

"Must be a California thing, huh?" I asked, but nobody answered.

Eventually I was able to pry them away from their bottle cap and the dumbwaiter, which I immediately divested of dolls. Because who the hell needed that image in her head, of a bunch of dolls hiding inside the walls of an old house? Which is now ingrained in the membrane, so Merry Christmas, everyone.

But that was just weird. Things really unraveled when we headed downstairs.

Clark began telling us that in the original plans for the home there had indeed been space allocated for an actual ballroom. But whether due to resources, a lack of interest, or simply because the frontier at that time didn't host too many balls (Clark's personal theory), the ballroom was scratched. At that time, however, if a family was a member of society, then balls were a part of the social calendar. And ballrooms were constructed. This revelation led us to a grand discussion, mostly between Clark and Caroline, about the golden age of San Francisco and the parties and balls held in the mansions before the Great Earthquake of 1906 and subsequent fire that burned most of the city to the ground. I listened in with some interest, but mainly picked at the chipped paint on the doorjamb I was leaning on. Clark stopped me every time he saw me doing it, and at a certain point it became a game: How many pieces could I chip off before he stopped me? Childish, yes, but more interesting than listening to that crap.

Which brings me to what really chipped my paint.

If you know anything at all about old homes, then you know they're very compartmentalized. Homeowners in 1890 would never have entertained the idea of "open concept." Kitchens would be and should be separate from the dining room, and not just in case there were actually servants serving. Even small houses were constructed that way. Women cooked, men read the newspaper, children rode around on things that didn't require seat belts or helmets, all in separate places within the home. And then they gathered in the dining room, quite removed from the stink and smoke from old-timey cooking. A swinging door between the two rooms created ease of movement, but allowed the mess to be hidden from view.

I suggested that perhaps not only could the swinging door be removed, but the entire wall between the two rooms could be removed, letting in more light and creating a more versatile space.

I watch HGTV; I knew what I was talking about.

What I had never watched was Survivor, and therefore I knew nothing of an alliance. But I saw one hatched right in front of my eyes. Clark and Caroline bonded, united in their determination to save the swinging door and to never, I repeat never, allow the idea of knocking a wall down at Seaside Cottage to be spoken of again.

That last part? With the never allow, and all that? Go ahead and reread that, channeling Charlton Heston and the best Moses he could muster.

I was outmanned, outgunned, and out-Moses'd.

My backup was firmly in the librarian's camp, who was now leading Caroline up the staircase to the site of the Battle of the Balustrade.

"Oh, no you don't, you're not talking her into saving this rickety old bannister," I started, dashing up in front of them and standing firmly in front of Clark.

He ignored me, turning to Caroline. "This was handcrafted by Jeremiah Woodstove, and it's one of the only remaining few in this style," he told Caroline, who ooohed and aaahed.

I smacked the damned bannister with my hand and the whole thing wobbled. "It's falling apart. It's rickety, it's unsafe, and it gave me a splinter the other day! See?" I shoved my hand under Clark's nose, and his eyes grew big. Perhaps because last time I was so close to his face, I'd drawn blood.

"I hardly think that a splinter is a reason to tear down the entire balustrade." He looked at my hand. "But I am sorry about your splinter."

"It's not a big deal," I mumbled. "And I didn't say I wanted to tear the whole thing down. Just the wobbly parts."

I stared up at him, noticing for the first time how very tall he was. Sure, part of it was because he was on the step above me, but he was also just a tall man. A tall man with a busted nose. "And I'm sorry about your nose, in case I forgot to tell you," I whispered.

"You did," he whispered back, with a tiny smile. "Forget to tell me."

"Well, I'm telling you," I said, noticing that Mimi was perched at the top of the stairs peering over the railing like a mouse. And Caroline had backed away and was at the bottom of the stairs looking up.

Smiling.

Ugh.

"Mimi, I'm going to take a few minutes to get my notes together. Why don't you come on down and help me," Caroline said, and Mimi danced down the stairs.

As she passed me, she said, "I redid your linen closet and the hall closet, and your aunt's clothes you'd piled up are now in boxes by color and season. You're welcome."

They disappeared around the corner, and I looked back up at Clark. "Did you know my aunt very well?"

"Somewhat. I helped her get a grant a few years ago, which she used to fix some things around here. But she kind of withdrew in recent years." He gestured to some of the clutter I still hadn't dealt with. "I didn't know about all this. It wasn't this bad the last time I was here."

"Sounds like no one knew it was this bad. I hadn't been here since I was a kid, and it definitely didn't look like this back then."

"Were you close?" he asked.

"Me and Aunt Maude? No, I hadn't spoken to her in years," I answered, starting down the steps.

He followed me. "Strange, isn't it?"

"Strange?"

"That she left the house to someone she barely knew. I mean no offense, of course."

"No, it is strange. My family and I have been trying to understand it ever since I got the call from Mr. Montgomery. The best I can figure is she knew I loved this house and was probably the least likely to sell it out of everyone in my family."

"And no jealous brothers or sisters that wanted a house like this?" he asked.

This was the first real conversation we'd ever had.

"No sisters. Five older brothers, though. And none of them wanted it. Well, a couple of them were a little peeved that they didn't get the chance to sell it off and pocket the cash, let's say that. I think that-hey, where'd you go?" I looked behind me.

Clark was still at the bottom of the staircase. "You've got five older brothers?"

"Yeah."

"And they're all back in Philadelphia?"

"Yeah. Why?"

"No reason," he said, hurrying to my side and pushing the swinging door open. "After you."

I ducked under his arm, and looked up at his face. "You okay, Clark? You seem a little pale."

"Must be the nose," he said, and followed me into the kitchen.

"So those are my recommendations for now, Viv, based on the limited amount of time I've been here. I think most of what you want to do to make it more comfortable to live here can be accomplished without making any significant changes to the house itself." Caroline sat at the kitchen table that afternoon with her notepad open, referring to it here and there as she laid out an initial plan for a renovation.

Clark and I had listened intently, only interrupting a few times.

"As for you, Clark, I know how you feel about this house, and for the most part I agree with you in terms of the aesthetic of leaving these old homes intact. However, my girl Viv needs to actually live here, not be a caretaker in a museum, so you're going to have to be flexible, okay?" she said, pointing a finger at him.

I shot him a self-satisfied look, until she turned that finger on me. "Now, the house is on the historical register, and he's in charge of that. So if you want your house to remain on the register-and you do, believe me-then you're going to have to work with him. Okay?"

Now Clark was the one with the self-satisfied look. Humpf.

"I'm leaving a list of three contractors I've worked with in the area, and they're all solid. Once I get back to my office I'll prepare a list of some of the things you want to do right away, like the roof and the porch. Get a bid from each of them, then we'll go from there. Sound good?" she asked, closing her notebook.

"I think so. How much do I owe you?"

"Not a dime; I've been dying to get away for a weekend. Just promise me that next time I come up, you'll have a room ready for me to stay in." She smiled at me, and I gave her a hug. She was a pretty cool chick. "And, Clark, you said you have copies of the grant her aunt received, yes? Can you send me a copy of that?"

"Of course. I know right where it is," he said, closing up his briefcase.

"Dewey decimal system, right?" I joked.

He gave me a baleful stare. "Don't mock the system, Vivian."

"I wouldn't dream of it," I answered, standing up and heading for the fridge. "Now who wants a beer?"

"Gimme." A deep voice sounded from the other side of the screen door, and we all turned. Simon and Ryan had returned from windsurfing, clad in wet suits and grins.

"Brrr, aren't you cold?" Mimi asked, hurrying outside with a few towels I'd recently folded.

"Nah, it's just brisk!" Ryan answered, his teeth chattering.

"Looks more than brisk. You sure you don't want some coffee? I can have some made in"-I looked at the Magic Chef stove-"an hour?"

"Nah, we'll be fine. Beer's good," Simon said, pulling down his wet suit in front and toweling off. Caroline dropped her notepad. Oh boy. And Mimi? She was getting frisky with the brisk. I grabbed two beers and held them out the porch door with my eyes closed.

"Here. Someone take these. Hurry," I instructed, laughing when I heard Mimi squealing. "Clark, you want one?" I asked, hearing his deep laughter behind me when Caroline got a face full of wet suit. Aw yeah.

"No, no I should get going. Not sure where this is heading," he said, still laughing.

"I'll walk you out." We bobbed and weaved through the couples on the porch, laughing as they said good-bye to Clark. As we headed for his car down the driveway, I caught him peeking at the garage.

"Do you know about her car?" I asked.

"The Bel Air? Oh yeah, that car's a legend in this town. I grew up seeing it all over the place; not the kind of car you forget."

"I haven't even been too far into the garage; you wouldn't believe the amount of crap that's out there. But from what I've seen so far, it's a pretty sweet car."

"You know, Maude probably got all of the maintenance done at Brady's Auto-that's where everyone in town goes. I bet they still have all her records when it was in for service." We'd reached his car and he set his briefcase inside, then leaned back against the door. "I could make a call, see if they still have those records, if you wanted me to."

He smiled down at me, his shy grin prompting one in return. "You don't have to go to any trouble, Clark. It's sweet, though."

"It's no trouble, really. I don't mind."

"You sure this isn't just a plot to get to ride around in it?" I teased. How did I ever think his hair was just brown? In the sun it was more like a deep chestnut, with hints of honey and russet. It was curling slightly in the salty air, waving away from his face now. "You want to get behind that wheel?"

"Now that you mention it, I-"

He was interrupted by a great rumbling as Hank's massive beastly truck thundered up the gravel driveway and around the corner of the house.

He climbed out of the truck with an easy grace, the kind that comes with knowing exactly what your body is capable of. Blond hair pulled back, with a few escaped pieces bouncing freely around his face. He pulled off his shirt, then grabbed a few apples from the truck. He looked up, briefly caught my eye, and headed for the barn. But when he noticed me talking to Clark?

He turned midstride and headed directly for us. Clark stood up straighter, moving the tiniest bit closer to me. Hank's eyes had laser locked on me, dragging his gaze down my body and back up again in a way that made me gulp. The other alternative was to drool; I was literally salivating.

He stopped not a foot from me. He held my stare in the way that really good-looking men can, knowing that their presence is enough. Then he opened his mouth to speak, finally initiating conversation with me!

" 'Sup, Viv?"

The man was a poet. I had no words. Strike that, I had one.

" 'Sup?"

He grinned at me, and I swear on all that is holy a sunbeam broke through the clouds and shone directly on him, highlighting the planes of his exquisite face and letting me know that beauty had a name, and its name was Hank.

"Oh for pity's sake," I heard behind me. I turned to see Clark staring at the two of us with a disapproving look on his face.

"Sorry about that, Clark. Do you know Hank?" I asked, sliding out of the way as the two appraised each other.

"Of course I know him. Small town, remember? How are you, Hank?"

"Hiya, Clark. What the hell happened to your face? You run into a door again?" Hank asked, starting to juggle the three apples he was holding.

"No I didn't run into a door, I-"

Hank interrupted, "Senior year of high school, this guy ran right into a sliding glass door, broke his nose and the glass. It was hilarious! Man, that was a killer party too, everyone was there. Even Clark! I don't think I'd ever seen you at a party before, come to think of it, and the one time you come, you walk right into a glass door! Oh man, that still cracks me up!"

Clark chuckled. "Yep, you got me there. Pretty funny stuff." But his eyes weren't laughing.

I felt like I should laugh, since they both were. But I couldn't.

And after a few seconds, Hank was the only one. He finally stopped juggling, then said, "I brought these for the horses. Want to try giving one of them an apple?" He tossed one and I caught it.

"Sure, gimme a sec." I turned back to Clark. "Thanks for coming by today. I really appreciate all the help with the house."

He looked at me coolly. "Please keep me abreast of the bids you receive from the contractors, and consult me before making any final changes."

I blinked. We were back to that?

"Viv! Come on!" Hank called, backing away toward the barn and beckoning me with one finger.

"I hope you have a pleasant visit with your friends, Vivian," Clark said, getting into his car and driving away.

I walked across the yard toward the barn, noticing that the four on the porch were silent, watching as I followed Hank. I never even got to the barn, though, because I started sneezing and didn't stop for almost two minutes.

Chapter eight

That evening I went back with my friends to Mimi's family's house to have dinner. We ate, we drank, we played Pictionary (these four are oddly fierce when they are playing games), and just had a nice evening.

They stopped by in the morning before heading back to San Francisco, bringing pastries from the bakery in town, and I fired up the French press again. I'd found an old painting tarp in the garage and before they left, the boys and I headed up to the roof to tie it down. The forecast was calling for rain this week, and I didn't want to spend another night moving buckets all over the living room. We got it tied down nice and secure, and it seemed like a good temporary fix until the roof could be replaced.

We were outside by the Range Rover, getting everyone situated and settled, Mimi talking a mile a minute about stopping for beef jerky. "I'm telling you, Simon, it's the best jerky ever! Just ask Ryan. I make him stop every time we come up here to see my folks, you'll see."

"I've learned not to argue with that one." Simon laughed, draping an easy arm around my shoulders. "Sure is nice to have you out here, Viv. You gotta come down to the city sometime and see our place in Sausalito."

"I'll totally take you up on that offer, as soon as I get things settled around here," I said, leaning my head on his shoulder. I missed my brothers, and I was glad to have Simon only a few hours away if I needed him. I patted him on the butt, then reached for his best girl.

"Can't thank you enough for everything you did, Caroline, although you and Clark did get a little too close for my comfort," I teased.

She raised an eyebrow at me. "Yeah, what a terrible guy," she said, making a show of hanging herself. "I have to say, after all the buildup, he wasn't exactly the monster you made him out to be."

"He's okay, just a little uptight for me. Keeps me on my toes, though. And it's fun making him squirm a bit. I was going to send him a text later asking if he wants to help me paint all the trim Day-Glo orange." I grinned.

"You're kind of a shit-you know this, right?" she asked, laughing as she pulled me into a hug.

"Kind of?"

"Now you let me know, Viv, if you need any more help organizing. I left my card and a price sheet for you on the dining room table, with a discount, of course, since we're buddies now. So when you're ready to really get organized, you call me, okay?" Mimi asked as Ryan helped her into the backseat.

"Buckle up, dear," he said. "Nice you meet you again, Viv. We come up here a few times a year, so we'll see you again. You're coming down to San Francisco for the wedding, right?"

"That's a brilliant idea!" Mimi said. "Oh, Viv, you have to come! Oh my God, Ryan, that's the best idea you've ever had. It's going to be the prettiest wedding anyone has ever seen! And you can-"

Ryan shut the car door and went around to the other side. As soon as he opened the door I heard:

"-and the cake has seven tiers, can you believe it? All the attendants have to wear black, I'm the only one in white, of course, and ..."

Caroline told Simon, "Let's get the jerky as soon as possible-it's a three-hour drive." She climbed into the front seat, leaving Simon and me standing there.

"Wind-surfing lesson next time?" he asked.

"Yup. Now get outta here."

He got in and they sped off, Mimi's hands waving excitedly as they pulled away. I chuckled for a moment, then headed back inside. It was really quiet in the house now. I finished my coffee, put in my earbuds, and got back to work cleaning.

And I noticed for the first time how big the house was for just one person.

The rest of that day was weird, and ended even weirder. I spent the day clearing out the living room. I'd started to divide things into piles: keep, donate, trash. There was a lot in the donate pile; someone was going to be set for tube socks for years. Aunt Maude was an As Seen On TV shopper if I'd ever seen one. Slap Chops, the WaxVac, the Chillow (which I was keeping, what a great idea!), to say nothing of the entire shrine dedicated to Ron Popeil and his empire. Food dehydrators, rotisserie grills-I even found a box of old-fashioned hair spray in a can.

I wondered again how Aunt Maude turned out the way she did. Fiercely independent, but also, it appeared, fiercely lonely. And not only did I wish that wasn't the case, I also wished she'd not left quite so much crap behind for someone else to clean up. The Ronco knife sets were great and all, but really ... five sets? And if she had the money for all this crap, why was there a leaky roof? Especially when she had seventeen tubes of Putty Friend, another As Seen On TV product Maude had ordered for herself and stockpiled ...

I knocked off cleaning a little early to cook myself a nice dinner. The stove and I were beginning to understand each other, and I wanted to take our relationship to the next level. Nothing fancy, mind you, but perhaps some chicken? A few vegetables? Could I swing some rice? We were going to find out.

After a quick shower, I headed down to the kitchen. Within minutes I had a decent amount of vegetables chopped, a pot of water simmering for rice, and a couple of chicken br**sts in the oven, planning to use the extra one later in the week for lunch or in a salad. No pizza this week, no way, no sir! Time to get into a normal routine!

I opened up the windows in the kitchen, throwing the back door open wide to let in that last little bit of sunshine. The skies to the east were looking gray and the wind was beginning to kick up; it looked like we were going to get a storm. I said a silent thank-you to Ryan and Simon for tying the tarp down; the evening would be much nicer without the rain inside the house.

But the air before a storm always smelled so fresh, so I let it all in. The house was finally beginning to lose that musty closed-up smell after a week of solid cleaning. I'd poured a glass of red wine to sip while I cooked, and with the radio tuned to the oldies station, it made for a cozy night to stay in and cook.

Because I grew up in a large family, it was never a question of whether I would learn to cook or not, it was merely a question of when. For the record, I was eight when I started scrambling my own eggs and making my own toast. Cooking for one had been a bit of an adjustment, since my favorite family recipes were formulated to feed an army. But as I got older and was single longer, I learned that there was something a little special about preparing a meal just for yourself. Setting the table for one was just as important as setting the table for fourteen. So I dug up some pretty china plates, washed them, stacked them in the kitchen, and even lit a candle in the dining room.

Pat on the back for me.

Back in the kitchen, I sizzled and stirred, adding a pinch of this and a sprinkle of that. Rice was in, garlic and onions were sauteing, and I had just added some broccoli to the pan when I heard-

Flap-flap-flap.

Cocking my head sideways, I listened again. What was that? But after a moment, all I heard was vegetables cooking, so I went back to them. Another minute went by. My chicken should be almost done now, I should check it-

Flap-flap-flap-flap

Okay, what the hell was that? My slotted spoon and I headed into the dining room-all clear. Living room? All clear as well. Was I hearing things?

The wind was beginning to really kick up, the curtains were waving in the breeze on either side of the fireplace. Maybe that was the noise I was hearing. But as soon as they were closed, I heard it again, coming from the dining room.

Flap-flap-flap.

I headed for the dining room. Dammit. What the hell was-

A bat!

It dove at me and I ran screaming out onto the front porch, slotted spoon in one hand, the other clasped over my head.

Flap-flap-flap-flap.

"Get out get out get out get out!" I screamed, stamping my foot and going through the rotten wood again. And this time? It got stuck.

"Sonofawhore!" I cursed, setting down the spoon and trying to pull my foot clear. Nope, it was stuck on something but good. "Cocksucking f**k!" I swore again. Somewhere, my mother most certainly frowned at my choice of words.

Thunder boomed nearby, and from inside the house?

Flap-flap-flap.

I instinctively ducked, even though I was out on the porch. The porch that had been trying to eat me piece by piece since I got here. I tried to calm down; getting frustrated wasn't going to help. Think, Viv!

I tried to keep my weight off my stuck foot, since every time I pushed down to try and get some leverage, it seemed to get even more wedged in. I started to think about what might be under that porch, what might have ahold of my foot.

One of those dolls ...

That's it! My phone was in my pocket, thank God-but who was I going to call? Simon was back in San Francisco by now, and I had no idea how to get hold of Hank. Mr. Montgomery? No, he was too old. I didn't want to call 911, because while in my own head this constituted an emergency, in the grand scheme of things, it really wasn't.

You know who you have to call.

Oh, man.

And do it quickly, before the doll takes another bite.

I called the librarian.

"Well, well, well."

"Lookee what we have here," I finished, peering up at Clark.

"I couldn't have said it better myself," he answered, walking slowly up the steps.

When I'd called him, he said he'd be right over. And he hadn't laughed, just asked if I was all right and did I need anything. I told him a margarita would be nice. He'd ignored that request, but he had brought his toolbox. Rubbermaid. Red. Stamped with Clark Barrow on the side-in case someone tried to take it?

Sunday Evening Clark was much more dressed down: faded jeans, running shoes, untucked plaid shirt over a white undershirt. I suddenly said a prayer that it wasn't a tank-top undershirt, that he was the kind of guy who wore T-shirts, and then mentally slapped myself for giving a shit what he wore under his faded plaid shirt. That looked soft and comfortable and warm. I shivered. It was getting cold out here, playing buoy on the sea of porch.

He knelt down in front of me and assessed the situation.

"One would think it unwise, Vivian, knowing the condition of this rotten wood, to traipse about so carelessly," he said as he poked at the wood around my left leg, which was buried to midthigh. I'd been sitting half on and half off the broken wood for the better part of twenty minutes, and was starting to get more than a little agitated.

"One would think that after getting punched in the nose one would be unwise to provoke me," I said sweetly.

He turned his gaze from my leg to my face, his eyes calculating. "You're the one stuck in the porch. You sure you want to pick a fight with me right now?"

He had me there, dammit. "Okay, fine. No fight picking. But do something, Clark."

"I'm waiting for the magic word."

"Um, now?"

"Really?"

"Asshole?"

"Come on."

"Clark!"

"Vivian."

"Oh, fine. Please help me, Clark. Please, please, please?" I managed, gritting my teeth.

"That wasn't so bad, was it?" he smiled, his face lighting up.

"Still not out of this porch here," I said.

He nodded. "As personally gratifying as it is to see you like this, there is a bit of storm coming and I'd rather not be out here when it hits. So let's see what we can do here, shall we?"

"Yes, shall we?" I repeated, leaning back so he could get a better look at how I was wedged.

"Pardon me, I need to get a little closer here. I just-Ah, yes, I can see it there." Clark had leaned across me, one arm on either side of me as he peered through the broken board to the ground below. His head was almost flush with the floor. And flush with what else was on the floor. Flush with my- Oh my. I unexpectedly felt his breath on my bare thighs. I was dressed in running shorts that left little to the imagination, and my imagination was bombarding my senses with the most inappropriate images.

All I could think about was if he just moved about three inches to the left, he could probably get me off with his jaw alone. And how in world had I never noticed that it was so very strong, so very chiseled, so very lightly covered with Sunday-evening stubble? Stubble that could so very easily drag back and forth across the inside of my legs, up and down, and right and left, and then up, up, and away toward my-

"I'm going to have to go down," he said, and it took all the strength I had not to bury my hand in that flippy soft brown hair and take him at his word.

"Sorry?" I asked, panting. I was panting, for Christ's sake! Over a librarian?

Mmmm, over a librarian ...

"I have to go down beneath the porch. Believe me, I'm not looking forward to it. Who knows what's under there?" he said, turning toward me. All I could see was bandage, and the bruises that were fading from purple to yellow around the edges, and the spell was broken.

Still breathing a little heavy, I warned him to watch out for dolls. And watched as he hurried down the steps, around the side of the house, and began removing the latticework cover on the side of the porch with the utmost care.

What the hell! Lusting after a librarian, when there was a cowboy on the loose? It was clear that lusting after Hank had addled my brains. I was seeing things, imagining things, getting hot over the slightest touch, even from a guy like Clark.

The wind blew more forcefully across the porch, and I shivered. What the hell was taking so long?

"Hey! You want to put a little hustle on over there?" I finally called out, when the third piece of lattice was placed carefully onto the porch.

His head popped up over the edge. "Do you have any idea how old this is?"

"Do you have any idea how much it's going to suck if you're caught underneath there in the rain?"

He looked at the sky, getting darker by the minute. "Point taken." He pried off the last of the lattice, then disappeared.

I could hear scrambling coming from beneath me, and then I could feel the ground shifting a little under my stuck foot.

"Vivian? It's just me. Don't be alarmed."

"No kidding, Clark. Who else would it be?"

"Well, pardon me all over the place. I was just concerned that if you were surprised, your first instinct would be to kick. So let's see what we can do about getting this free."

Then he put his hands on my leg. Wrapped his hands around my ankle, turning it slightly. "Okay, it's wedged into a cement block, but I think I can get it loose. Bear with me a moment, Vivian."

"It's Viv. And be careful, huh?" I called down.

"Impossible woman," he muttered. His hands traveled a little farther up my leg, inside, and then around the back of my knee. And then I felt ... well, it felt like ...

"Clark! Did you just lick-"

"No!" he yelled, wrenching my foot free at that exact moment and pushing it up through the porch. I fell backward, my leg pulling clear of the wood and my heart pounding. I saw him crawl out from beneath the porch, dust himself off, and then walk toward me.

I pointed at him. "You licked my leg."

"I did nothing of the kind," he said. But the tips of his ears were red.

Flap-flap-flap-flap.

"Ah crap, I forgot about that."

"You're kind of a two-crisis girl, aren't you?" He laughed, reaching behind his toolbox and picking up a lacrosse stick.

"That's what you brought to kill a bat?"

"It was either this or my squash racket." He took a few practice swipes at the air. "Besides, we're not going to kill it. We're going to catch it, then let it go."

"There is no we. There's a you, as in you are going to get the bat!"

"It's your house, you should be helping me," he said. "And for someone who acts so tough, you sure are scared of a little thing like a bat."

"I'm not scared!"

When he had the nerve to make a bowing gesture, as if to say well then, go ahead on in without me, I grumbled, "Okay fine-I'm a little scared. I'll help you, but you're going in first." I stood up and brushed off my shorts. I now had another scrape to match the one on the other leg. Honestly.

I rummaged in the garage until I found a rake and a bucket, then rejoined Clark on the porch. Stepping over the hole, I huddled behind him as he opened the front door. We went inside, alert and listening.

"Is something burning?" he asked, sniffing the air.

"Dammit, my dinner!" I wailed, rushing past him and into the kitchen. "Motherfucker!"

"Vivian!" Clark exclaimed, hurrying past me to turn off the burners. Smoke billowed from the oven, my chicken br**sts now charred beyond recognition. Rice? Now a cake in the bottom of the pan. And the vegetables? Crust. I started throwing the pots into the sink, probably slamming them a little harder than necessary. I was pissed at the porch, pissed at the house, pissed that my leg hurt, and pissed off that I still had a bat in the house. A bat in the house!

"Were you expecting someone for dinner?" Clark asked from the doorway to the dining room. His face looked tight-hurt?

I glanced past him and saw the candles burning on the table. "No, that was just for me," I replied, pushing past him and blowing out the candle.

"You lit candles just to eat alone?"

"Yeah. So?" I asked, turning back to him. I saw the bat. It was perched on the lacrosse stick, just behind his head.

"Oh. Boy. Um, Clark?"

"I think if you want to light candles, even if it's just you, that's perfectly okay," Clark said, nodding at me.

"Right. Agreed. But right now? You need to-"

"I mean, after all, if you don't think you're good company, no one else will, right?"

"Totally. Can I just-"

"I eat most of my meals alone too, although I've never thought about lighting candles. Not sure a guy doing it would be seen as being quite as empowering as it is for a girl, rather sad actually. But shoot, I'll try anything once I suppose. So good for you, Vivian. Light a candle why don't you, you deserve it. Even if it is just chicken or-"

"Duck."

"Or duck, exactly, even if it's-"

"Fucking duck, Clark!" I yelled, lunging in with my rake and swatting at the bat.

Clark hit the deck and I knocked the bat off the back of the lacrosse stick. "Bucket! Bucket!" I yelled, and he slid it across the floor. Slamming it down on the bat, I sat on top of it, giving a war cry. "Wahoooooo!" I lifted the rake high over my head in victory.

It caught in the chandelier and damn near ripped the entire thing out. And as it hung from the ceiling, swinging back and forth, I sat on a bucket in the middle of my dining room, with a bat under my butt, and a librarian under the table.

Cue lightning and thunder.

Cue crashing rain.

There was nothing I could do but laugh.

There were no leaks, though-so there was that.

Chapter nine

Clark could rally, I gotta give him that. Twenty minutes later the bat was set free, the windows were all closed against the torrent of rain that was lashing at the house, and I was perched at my kitchen table with one Mr. Clark Barrow at the stove. Wearing an apron he'd found hanging in the pantry, he was scrambling me some eggs and making toast like it was his job.

"Well, what else were you going to do?" he'd asked when he'd first suggested helping me make something else for dinner.

"Order a pizza?"

"You've got eggs and bread; how about I make us something to eat? It'll give the rain a chance to slow up before I head home," he said, and I agreed. And now here he was, cooking for us both.

I'd warned him about how temperamental the stove was, but he had the hang of it. "My Nana used to have a stove just like this one, I'm used to it," he said, expertly flipping the burners and lighting it just so.

"I'm impressed," I said, and I was. Sure, it was just eggs and toast, but I'd punched the guy not too long ago, yet here he was, making me dinner. Nice guy.

I had no idea what to do with a nice guy. I'd never dated a clean-cut, Backstreet Boy type; I'd always stayed in the heavy metal/alternative, dirty, tattooed-boy section. I could appreciate what a Nick Lachey had to offer, sure, but my type was always going to be a Dave Navarro, a Chris Cornell.

A nice guy? Hmmm.

Shaking off the feeling, I sipped my wine. "So, tell me about yourself, Clark."

"Me? What's there to know?"

"Oh, I bet plenty. Tell me about the man, the myth, the legend."

He raised an eyebrow at me, then nodded at the wine. "Pour me another glass and you'll get all three."

Yeah, I poured. He talked. Born and raised in Mendocino, he'd gone away to college at Pepperdine, history major, minor in library sciences. His family had always been heavily involved in the area's historical society, preserving old homes, churches, restoring and repurposing older buildings. He confirmed what Caroline had already told me, that much of the town of Mendocino was in fact a historical site. Most of those efforts were privately funded, although he worked with homeowners to apply for and receive federal grants, like the one my aunt had received. The library was his main job, although hours had been cut steadily over the last few years and there was now a pretty small staff that assisted him.

"No one does pure research anymore, not without the Internet of course. Sure, we've adapted pretty well, but for the most part, the library here exists for a pleasure reader. Although with Kindles and iPads, we're even starting to see those readers begin to slip away. Plates?" he asked, bringing the pan with the scrambled eggs to the table. I helped him butter the toast, and we settled ourselves around the kitchen table. There was still a rake stuck in the chandelier in the dining room and it was raining too hard to go out to the barn for the ladder so, yeah, that was out for tonight.

"Well, I'll be down for my library card just as soon as I can." I forked up a mouthful. "Mmm, these are great, Clark. You want some hot sauce?" I asked, sprinkling Tabasco over everything on my plate.

"I'll pass. Do you read a lot?"

"I've been known to, sure," I said, hoping my face wasn't as pink as it felt.

"Last book you read that changed how you felt about something," he said.

I thought quickly. Not sure I could tell him about Loins, and how it changed the way I now saw baguettes. "Um, let's see. Black Holes and Baby Universes."

"Wow, impressive. Hawking. How did you think it compared to A Brief History of-" The kitchen was suddenly plunged into darkness. "I wondered when that was going to happen," he said.

"What happened?" I asked, looking around in the dark. I had a flashlight in here somewhere.

"Power goes out in town when there's a bad storm. They usually have it back on within a few hours, though, not to worry."

"I'm not worried." I fumbled in the drawer until I found it. "Ah, there we go!" I said, turning on the flashlight.

"What wattage is that thing?" he asked, holding up his hands.

It was a bit bright.

"No dimmer on this thing, sorry," I said, trying to cover it up a bit. "Wait, I know!" I hurried into the other room, dodging the rake, and grabbed the candles. Striking a match, I lit them quickly, then set them down on the kitchen table. "See? Even breakfast for dinner can have ambience."

I looked across the table at him, hair rumpled from the bat fight, mud on his T-shirt from being under the porch, and an intense-looking smile. And the bandage, God bless it. I smiled back at him, then took a bite of toast.

"So, Clark, does your family still live here in town?"

"Oh no, now it's my turn to ask the questions." He grinned, slapping another coat of strawberry jelly on his toast. He licked each finger; jellying toast by candlelight was a messy business. "So where are you from, exactly? I've been trying to place your accent all week."

Damn. Had it really only been a week? "My accent?"

"Yes, it's very specific. Not just generic back east, although I'm fairly certain it's in that general area."

"It's in that general area, yes." I nodded, enjoying where this was going. Philadelphia natives did have a very specific accent, although most couldn't place it.

"It's not New York."

"State or city?" I asked.

"It's neither. And it's not Boston. It's not New Jersey, although I admit my knowledge of that accent is limited by my addiction to The Sopranos," he said with a half grin.

"You're close. Philadelphia. Specifically, a little town just outside the city."

"Philadelphia. So tell me, what do you do back there in Philadelphia?"

"Well, until recently I owned my own software company."

He dropped his toast. "You owned your own-what?"

"Yep. I'm a software engineer by trade, got lucky with a program after college and went out on my own."

"So what did you specialize in?"

"In a nutshell? I write programs that do data mining. You know, look for needles in a cyber haystack? Just sold a new program a few months ago."

"You said until recently. Are you not doing it anymore?" he asked, looking fascinated.

"No, after all of this kind of fell into my lap I decided to sell my little company to a bigger company. They'd been making offers for years, and to be honest, my heart just wasn't really in it anymore. So when they offered again, I sold it. Well, I'm in the beginning stages of selling it."

"Who are you selling it to?"

"Franklin Logistics and Software."

This time he choked on his toast. "You just sold your company to Franklin LandS?"

I passed him his water. "Well, going through the process, but yep."

"Wait- Vivian Franklin. Franklin LandS. Any relation?"

"Sure, it's my dad's company." I grinned.

Clark sat there for a moment, digesting. "Can I ask something?" he said.

"Sure."

"Why did you sell it? I mean, sounds like things were going great for you back there. Why come here?"

I thought for a moment. "I think because I hadn't had an adventure in a long time, and I was ready for one. And this was exactly what I needed at exactly the right time," I said, dipping up a fingerful of jelly and licking it off. "Do you believe in fate, Clark?"

"Fate?" he asked abstractedly, watching my mouth closely.

"Yeah, fate. Do you think that there's a preordained path you're supposed to be on?"

"Never given it much thought, really. I'm pretty methodical. Not prone to whims," he said.

"No. I never would have guessed."

"You're teasing me, Vivian." He chuckled.

"Maybe just a little." We sat for a moment together, quiet and still in the candlelight. "So," I finally said, "I guess I should get the dishes started."

"I'll help you," he said, getting up to clear.

"Don't be silly. You cooked; I'll do the dishes." I took his plate before he could grab it and brought them both over to the sink.

"You wash, I'll dry?" he asked, tying his apron back on.

"That's a deal." I turned on the water. As we cleaned up, we chatted some more.

"So did you always know you wanted to go into computers?" he asked, drying the plate I'd just handed him.

"No, in fact I hadn't planned on going into it at all. Most of my family's in computers so I wanted to try something new, you know? Out of the box?"

"You? Out of the box? I never would have guessed," he said, swiping a soapy fingertip down the ink on my arm.

"Don't poke fun, Clark. That's my design there," I warned, flicking a bubble at him from the sink.

"You're a tattoo artist too?"

"No, but I minored in art in college, and spent some time really trying to make a go of it before the computer bug bit me. This tattoo is one I designed myself." I twisted so he could see it better, the candlelight not being very strong.

He examined the ink, turning my arm to see how it wrapped around. "You drew this?"

"Mm-hmm." I drew in a breath at the feel of his hands on my skin. Backstreet Boy or not, he had good hands.

"You're very talented."

"Once, maybe. I haven't used that part of my brain in a long time, though."

"Why not?"

I chewed the inside of my cheek, not ready to answer that question. I never went back to it because I just fell into something new. I'd always assumed there'd be time for it, that I could go back to my painting later. That I could balance the practical with the artistic. But family and work became all encompassing.

It wasn't a bad life, just a life without a lot of ... passion. Adventure. Purpose. Intrigue. Wonder ... And paint. "Here," I said, handing him a slippery dish. He took it, drying it off without asking anything else.

We stood in the darkened kitchen, quietly cleaning up. It was nice, the not talking. When I finished washing up I leaned back against the counter, swallowing the last of the wine in my glass. He hummed a bit while he was working, a tune I almost recognized but not quite. His voice was even and pleasant, even humming. He caught me watching him but didn't stop his tune, just grinned a little.

I was struck by how easy this was, how comfortable it was. There was no onion to peel here; Clark was an open book. Easy to read, easy to predict, he'd tell me anything I asked him. No holding back, no games, no bullshit.

But also maybe no chase? No working for it, no running after, no stomach pangs, no hit of adrenaline when the little things go my way. Like when Hank threw me that apple, I got a thrill from that, right?

You also got a thrill when Clark was draped across you, breathing on your thighs ...

Well, I'm only human. And a human who is living in her own romance novel, remember? The house, the ocean, the cowboy? There's your passion. Adventure. Purpose. Intrigue. Wonder.

"Paint?"

"What's that?" I asked, brought out of my daydream.

"I was saying that if you wanted, I could help you paint the kitchen. When you're ready, of course."

The librarian finished drying the dish, still humming his merry tune.

And I thought long and hard about paint. I was still thinking about it after he went home.

Chapter ten

The next two weeks passed by quickly. I spent my days either cleaning, organizing, or driving countless bags of clothing, kitchen supplies, and ever-loving tube socks to a local shelter that was happy to take them off my hands. I found stack after stack of old plates, cups, and saucers; nothing too fancy but not cheap either. I pored over them, selecting a few pieces I wanted here and there but mostly packing them carefully into boxes and bringing those down to the shelter as well.

I threw away and recycled so much so that I now knew the names of the sanitation guys on my route. Threadbare rugs, moth-eaten coats and scarves were pitched; and bag after bag of magazines went into the recycling bin. Boxes of old receipts, calendars dating from the seventies, cassettes, CDs, VHS tapes, DVDs-pitched, recycled, or donated. The eight-tracks I donated to an antiques shop; I knew someone would pay money for those.

Encyclopedias, yellowed with age and warped from water damage under the leaky roof, and sadly with outdated information, were recycled as well. As Clark pointed out, not everything was worth saving.

Checkbooks, TV Guides, ads for local stores that had gone out of business years ago-there was no rhyme or reason to what was saved. And there was no easy way to go through this; you couldn't just go through bulldozer style and throw everything out. I realized that when a box that I mistakenly thought contained only old coupons had one of the original titles to the land the house was sitting on! And in a box of crappy costume jewelry? An antique brooch with a ruby the size of a marble. A marble!

"A very small marble, maybe, if you squint," Clark had said when I showed it to him.

"Oh where's your sense of storytelling?" I'd said right back to him.

I was recounting the story to Jessica one morning when she stopped by to see how things were going. She'd helped out a few times with sorting and packing, taking a carload herself down to the shelter a couple of days a week after her shift at the restaurant.

One afternoon I made her come up with me to the attic. After the initial foray into the basement, I wasn't too proud to admit I wanted some company; I'd seen way too many horror movies to venture into an attic alone. I promised her dibs on any creepy dolls we found up there.

The attic stairs were at the end of the hallway on the second floor, almost hidden behind the linen closet. Behind a door that you opened with a key, which had made it seem like a wonderland when I was a young girl.

Jessica and I opened the door with a loud creak. The stairs were as steep as I remembered, and creaky, just like attic stairs should be. Turning on a small landing, once you made it around that corner you could see how large it was. The house was truly grand, and it had an attic to match.

Spanning the length of the house, it had the widest plank floors I'd ever seen anywhere, and I'm from Pennsylvania, home of the wide plank. But this was the great wild north of California, and the timber that was milled back then was staggeringly huge. As we crept, quiet as little mice up the last few steps, I saw what I remembered more vividly than almost anything else from my childhood.

I saw miles and miles of unobstructed deep blue ocean. Window after window set into the back of the house, eight panes wide and equally as tall. An attic had no earthly reason to have this many windows, it was a waste of heat and space. But it didn't matter. Because the man who designed this home knew how important and how utterly unique a view of this magnitude would be. And thank goodness the subsequent generations felt the same way, as it was never walled over.

"Would you look at that," Jessica breathed behind me.

"It's stunning isn't it?" I said quietly. Who knows how long it had been since someone had been up here? The dust motes dancing in the air current we'd stirred up indicated that Aunt Maude hadn't used this space recently. And it was untouched by the pack rat stacks of crap that had taken over the rest of the house. It was still the attic from my childhood.

Dress mannequins were lined against one wall, like girls at a party waiting to be asked to dance. Some were wearing party dresses that had never been finished, and even after years of the sunlight fading them, the attic was filled with splashes of sugary pink, buttercup yellow, azure blue, kelly green, and ruby red. Sequins, bows, prints, and swirls waited to twirl.

On the other wall? Trunks, stacked four and five high. Travel stickers shellacked the sides with places I'd never heard of as a child, but sounded so exotic. Athens. Siam. Mexico City. Cleveland. Some of the trunks were empty, but others contained treasures. Old hats and gloves for playing dress-up, old-fashioned clunky cameras for pretending to take pictures while playing dress-up. Maps. Letters. Yearbooks full of people who had lived and cried and had babies and died, all before I was even born.

Old furniture, mirrors clouded with age but still reflecting everything that came within sight. Old landscape paintings, some of the sea, some of the mountains, but all massive and framed with ornately carved wood. I once found an anchor behind a full set of bowling pins, and had once launched an assault on the kingdom of Viviana with an army of tiny tin soldiers.

And it was all still there. Better yet, it didn't look small, as so many things from childhood do. It was still larger than life, and all in front of those gorgeous picture windows. Jessica and I oohed and aahed as we looked through it all, squealing in delight when we found some new shiny thing or perfectly darling bit.

"This is seriously the coolest house ever, Viv." Jessica sighed, sinking into an old wing chair by the windows.

"I know! I feel like I should be modest, but I so f**king know what you mean. This is the coolest house ever," I agreed, sitting on a tufted ottoman in front of a window, gazing out over the large expanse of blue.

"I knew there was a reason I always wanted to come and see the inside of this place," she continued, grabbing an old suntan reflector and making like a film star by the pool in the hills of Beverly. "What do you think you're going to do with all this space up here? You can't just use it for storage, it's too cool!" She angled the reflector to grab some additional rays.

I had an idea-an idea that had been working on me since I was twelve. I'd stood in front of the windows, the natural light pouring in as I'd pretended to paint one of the big landscapes. Holding an imaginary brush, I'd pretended to feather in different colors, maybe make a different choice in the shading of that tree, or the shape of that hill. I saw my own painting laid over the actual, and in my mind's eye I was in my own art studio.

I wasn't quite ready to share that thought out loud, though.

If I was really going to consider working in this space, I'd have to get some heating and cooling up here. And install screens in the windows so they could be opened. "It's getting a little stuffy up here; let's head back down and get something to drink."

"Are you sure? I feel like I didn't help you at all, we just played," she said, adjusting the top hat she was wearing.

"I kind of want to keep it like this for a while. So much of this house isn't at all like I remembered it," I said, running my fingertips across one of the paintings. "It's nice to have something be exactly the same."

She went down the stairs ahead of me and I paused at the top, looking back over the attic. There was another reason I was reluctant to disturb everything up here. I kind of wanted Clark to see it, as is.

I flicked off the light and followed Jessica downstairs.

We kept at the cleaning every day. Even Jessica's boyfriend, John, had been drafted when we realized how heavy the Legless Knight was. He and Clark lifted him, reunited his torso with his better half, and took him down to the antiques store that had taken some of the other things.

"Don't you think he should stay in the house?" Clark had asked, patting the knight on the head.

"No, he's too weird. And speaking of weird, the dolls are next on my hit list."

I laughed as he tried to spook me with stories of how, if I got rid of them, they'd plot their revenge.

What did not need a ton of work-cue surprise face here-was the Bel Air. Clark found the car keys in a mayonnaise jar in the pantry with all kinds of odds and ends. Spying a Buffalo nickel at the bottom of the jar, he upended the entire thing all over the kitchen table. And as he combed through the stuff, I saw a key chain with two very bright and shiny keys. Biting back a squeal in case they turned out to be the wrong ones, I snatched them up, ran out to the garage, and slid behind the wheel before Clark even knew I was gone. I'd planned only to slip the keys into the ignition to see if they fit, but when they did, I couldn't resist.

With a cough and a chortle, the engine purred to life. Clark ran outside, visions of a Bel Air-shaped hole in the garage no doubt in his head, and stood in front of the hood with a bemused expression on his face. I revved her up once, which made him sidle to the side a bit.

"It sounds pretty good!" I yelled over the engine, and he walked to the window.

"Let's not tempt fate, shall we? I'll have one of the guys from Brady's Auto come over while you're gone and make sure it's drivable. How 'bout that?"

Eager as I was to tootle about town in it, I realized that it wouldn't do me any good to get stranded on the side of the road. So I turned it off and reluctantly handed over the keys to Clark.

"Just so we're clear, you don't get to drive it first. Even if the guy says everything is great, you wait for me. Got it?" I said, poking him in the chest. He nodded, pocketing the keys. He'd better have listened to me ...

Clark was around most days now. Cleaning and culling was uncovering some other necessary repairs to the house, which of course he needed to be consulted on. I didn't mind. I'd gotten used to him being here. Now that the bandage was gone and the bruises had faded, I didn't mind looking at him so much.

And when you got past the briefcase and the tie, the elbow patches and the dusty eyeglasses, he was a pretty funny guy. He made me laugh; he made me think. He also made me furious. But he was quickly becoming a good friend.

And I'd been right about letting him see the attic as is. He loved it. He went bananas over the old yearbooks, especially since most of them were from the local high school. As he pored over old letters and receipts from stores long since shuttered, I studied the light as it shone in. Where the shadows were, where the light was the strongest. I began to mentally carve out a space that was becoming my studio.

"Can I help you with that?" Clark asked as I struggled to pull a trunk away from the wall.

"No no, I've got it," I insisted, pulling hard enough to make my eyes cross a bit. "What in the world is in here?" I mumbled, giving one more good tug and sending it, and me, sliding across the floor. I sat down hard, biting my tongue in the process. "Sonofa- Ow!"

"Impossible woman," he muttered, but was at my side a moment later. "You need to let people help you."

"What do you think I'm doing, with all this free labor cleaning out my house?" I said, wincing as I felt around the inside of my mouth. The piercing in my tongue clicked against the back of my teeth like it always did, and the sound made Clark look closer.

"You didn't lose your piercing, did you?" he asked, crouching down next to me and offering me his handkerchief. God bless him, he carried a hankie.

"No, it'd take a lot for this sucker to come out," I said, accepting what he offered and pressing it to the tip of my tongue where I'd bitten it.

"Did it hurt?" he asked.

"Well yeah, didn't you hear me yell?"

"I meant the piercing. When you got it."

"Why, you thinking about piercing something, Clark?" I asked with amusement.

"Good lord, no."

I laughed out loud. He sat down next to me on the floor of the attic and looked carefully at me. "I just wondered how it felt."

"It hurt, sure, but a good kind of hurt. And I was expecting it, unlike a moment ago. No biggie, I'm a tough girl. Five brothers, remember?"

He stared at me a moment, his eyes darting back down to my mouth. I poked the barbell out a little so he could see it, waggling my tongue at him. He breathed in hard. "Tough girl," he echoed.

We sat in a patch of sunshine, staring at each other. Eventually I put his handkerchief back into my mouth, and his eyes blazed. And when finally a cloud passed overhead and interrupted the sunshine, we both sat back a bit, each looking away. Clark finally moved, standing and offering me his hand. He pulled me up harder than I expected and I overbalanced, knocking us into each other. We both laughed.

"Well, let's see what's so darn heavy in this trunk!" he exclaimed, and set about worrying the lock open. I sucked on his hankie while I watched him work.

There was dust in his hair, and I reached out without thinking and ran my fingers through it. His hands faltered. "Dust," I murmured, stepping back and shaking my head.

"Mm-hmm," he replied, and sprang the lock. Taking a step back, he opened the trunk and we peered inside. "Well would you look at that," he said, admiring. I looked, and had no idea what I was seeing. Bronze, curved, looked like a ... cornucopia?

"Is that a horn of plenty? Like people put on the table at Thanksgiving?"

"Oh no. That's a speaker, Vivian," he said, lifting it carefully from the trunk. The delight on his face was evident; it was like he'd found treasure. "It's a gramophone. And in almost mint condition."

"Very cool," I breathed, looking past him into the trunk and seeing the base there, complete with needle.

"We should bring this downstairs, set it up in your living room."

"Good idea. You never know when there might be a Johnny Mathis emergency," I said.

His answering grin lit up the entire attic, even though the sun was still behind the clouds.

The gramophone was moved to the living room, and though Clark didn't have time to tinker with it for too long, we did bust out a Mathis album to make sure it worked. Scratchy and tinny, not at all the sound quality this century was used to, it was a great addition to the room.

The house was definitely taking shape.

What was not falling into place was the cowboy. Hank continued to make me hot, but good God almighty, he was proving to be a tougher nut to crack than I'd anticipated. Every day he came to feed the animals. Every day he stood in the driveway next to his truck, peeling off his shirt like he was posing for a calendar. Every day he worked in the barn, pitching hay, feeding the chickens, caring for the horses. Every other day he rode one of them instead of just turning them out in the adjacent pasture, and I'd stop box sorting or pile sweeping to stand in the window watching him.

Watching him saddle up, drawing the leather tight and checking the straps. Watching him swing himself up with only his own strength. Watching him shake out his hair like he was on the cover of Two Scoops of Passion or Catalonian Sex Gods (now in paperback!) and literally ride off into the sunset.

And how many times did I get myself off while thinking of the cowboy? I'd lost count. The absolutely erotic and detailed dreams I'd been having about my lover, whose face was still hidden to me but was of course my cowboy's, made me hornier than ever.

I'd awaken most nights, strung tighter than a bow, images of naked, sweaty, sexy times imprinted across the inside of my eyelids, and my hand would snake down down down to finish myself off, gasping and panting and coming so hard I'd see spots.

The onion peeling was slow going. God knows I tried, but Hank was not giving anything up. I thought back to all my favorite romance novels, where the hero was tough and unflinching in his beliefs. Where he guarded his dark secrets with the strength of a warrior and the stubbornness of a mule. But that was part of the journey, right? That was part of what the heroine had to push through and forward against all odds. She must never take no for an answer, she must fight back and use every feminine wile in her arsenal.

I wanted wild and wanton, but my arsenal was waning, whimpering, and wandering in the wah-wahs.

I tried every trick in the book. I waited until I knew Hank was heading toward his truck and could see me, then I walked past the windows in just my artfully draped towel. Once. Twice. Three times a weirdo.

I went out one morning still in my nightgown, a wispy cottony little bit of a thing, with a jar of peanut butter, saying that I simply couldn't get the top off and could he please help me? He opened the jar, told me that Peter Pan was gross and that he preferred Jif, then went back to mucking the stalls.

I sunned myself one afternoon on the back porch, all greased up and shiny in my bikini. When he finally appeared, he took no notice of me-until I gave up and tried to get out of the vinyl lawn chair. I was so slippery I slid right through the strapping. He came out of the barn and found me a tangle of slick arms and legs poking out though the vinyl strips, my actual bottom on the porch floor. He'd had to hold the chair down so I could get out. Even then, he just shook his head and went and rode Paula. Stupid lucky horse.

I boob propped, I booty shook, I cheek pinched and hair tossed. I was turning into the kind of girl I couldn't stand. I sucked lollipops, moaned in ecstasy when biting into a donut, and simpered like a fool while holding two avocados in the same hand while caressing an eggplant with the other. He'd asked if I was making a salad.

Not all still waters ran deep. Thank God these particular still waters ran gorgeous.

And while all this was going on, I was also getting ready to fly back to Philadelphia to pack up my things and officially move out to Mendocino.

The day before I left dawned clear and bright. I woke horny and frustrated. I'd spent another night being tortured/delighted by my faceless dark lover. The lover with the hands of a god and the mouth of a poet. With his mouth he told me the words I'd always longed to hear, but had never been told. He loved me, cherished me, would go to the ends of the earth to protect me, and would spend the rest of his life caring for me.

With his hands? He worked my body expertly, arousing me with wild abandon. The dirtiest, sexiest hands imaginable.

This dreamy dark lover was exactly the kind of man I wanted in real life. He was the blend of loving and lascivious that I'd been searching for since I'd first picked up a paperback and realized that dirty books could be a woman's best friend.

And when I woke from this last round of dreams, pulse racing and skin flushed I brought myself to yet another solitary but somewhat satisfying orgasm.

I needed more. I deserved more. But what I was taking? Right now? Was a cold shower. I had stuff to do.

I had breakfast in town since I wanted to catch up with Jessica before I left.

"Hey, girl, you're coming back, right?" she asked when I hopped up onto the stool at the end of the counter. She poured my coffee without asking and looked at me concernedly.

"Aw, are you afraid you're going to miss me?" I teased, wrapping my hands around the warm mug. It was chilly this morning and I wondered what the change of seasons would be like out here. I'd been raised on the beautiful explosion of color of the East Coast in the fall. The woods around our home were a riot of oranges and golds, fiery reds and deep yellows. You think California, you think sand and beach and sun. But this far north, it got cold. Would the leaves change?

"Miss you? Hell, no. I love going through shit from your basement." She laughed.

"You asked for it, sister. You're the one that wanted to help."

"Yeah, I know. Thank God I finally got to get into your attic."

"Why does that sound so dirty?"

"Because you ain't got a man?"

"Ain't got a man?" I snorted, rolling my eyes at her.

"It sounded funnier in my head. But the statement stands," she said, putting my order in. "How's it going with Hank?"

I put my head down on the counter and sighed into the Formica. "I got nothing. He barely looks at me."

"I told you, you're not his type. You're hot, sure, but way too short, way too brunette, and way too smart for him," she said, shaking her finger at me.

One day I'd finally confessed my crush (which she'd already guessed weeks ago) when she caught me staring out the window at him, biting down on a broom handle.

"He likes a very specific type of girl, Viv. I've known him a long time and he's always gone for a Barbie doll. There's been a Missy, a Cheyenne, a Dakota, and several Sharons when he was in his cougar phase. Never anything as cool as a Viv," she'd said, patting me on the arm.

I'd gone along with it, nodded when she railed against stupid women guys like Hank always go for.

In my head, though? It all fit the romance novel model. Gorgeous man with a taste for gorgeous woman, the same type over and over again. Trying to right a wrong? Chase a ghost? Punish himself with what he can never have? He needed a ravishing petite brunette with a back full of ink, a brain full of math, and a fistful of dick. His dick, because that brunette will be the one to break him of his punishing streak of one-night stands, hers will be the body he will feast from, her cries of passion will be the ones to erase a thousand nights of empty love and unfilled promises ...

I mean, dur. It's practically textbook. So everything Jessica was telling me? Just furthered the cause, made him that much more tantalizing, made the potential thrill all the more powerful when I finally cracked the nut that was Hank.

"God, I need to get laid."

"Um, right now?" Jessica asked, blinking at me.

"I mean it-I'm dying over here. Sorry, Mr. Martin," I said when he shot me a look.

"Maybe if you stopped reading so many of those sexy books, you wouldn't be so wound up." When color immediately flooded my cheeks she said, "I knew it! I knew those were yours! I thought you'd try and blame poor old Maude." She cackled, setting down my breakfast in front of me.

"Okay, some of those books? Are in fact Aunt Maude's. I found an entire Harlequin library in an upstairs closet, so apparently it runs in the family. And yes, I do enjoy a good steamy novel. Now gimme the hot sauce."

"Pretty sure that was one of the titles I saw on your nightstand the other day."

"No no, that was Hot Saucy Women and the Men Who Love Them. You're thinking of Gimme the Good Stuff. Subtitle, Now."

"Wow."

"Exactly," I agreed, and beckoned her closer. "Want to know a secret?"

"Always." She leaned closer.

"I think I might be living in a romance novel."

She looked confused. "What?"

"Yeah-like things are happening around me and to me, just like in a romance novel."

"Uh-huh. And do you see any of these things happening right now, Viv?"

"No no, not like that. I'm not delusional. But think about it. Put yourself in a romance novel head for a moment."

"I don't have a bodice."

"Neither do I, but I'm thinking about getting one. But seriously, think about it. I live on the other side of the country, and I get this mysterious phone call in the middle of the night. I inherit a house from someone I barely know, no strings attached. An opportunity to start fresh, start a new life-and then there's a cowboy?"

"And Hank's the cowboy, right?"

"Of course he's the cowboy! He wears a hat and rides a horse!"

"Okaaaay. What else?"

"What do you mean, what else? That's the beginning of a classic romance novel!" I said, thumping my fist on the counter.

"But the cowboy isn't interested in you."

"I know, so far. But that's all part of it, right?"

"And there's no one else in this equation?"

"Huh?"

"What if there's a dark horse in this romance novel?"

"You mean Paula?" I asked, confused.

"Oh forget it. But here's what I want to know. Where's the happy ending?"

"Mmm, the happy ending." I sighed, licking my fork.

"You're disgusting."

"Horny. There's a difference. Sorry, Mr. Martin." I nodded to my right.

"No, seriously. How can this have a happy ending, with Hank cast as the hero?"

I thought for a moment, temporarily puzzled. Truth be told, I'd thought something would have happened by now. I'd been here for weeks. A long time to wait for some touch.

A lightbulb went off. "A heroine can never know the outcome, otherwise why would she bother with the journey? The story would be boring if she just showed up with a mattress strapped to her back in the first chapter, right?"

"I don't know, there's something to be said for a quickie. Sorry, Mr. Martin. More coffee?"

"You girls are nutty," he said, extending his mug.

I walked home, thinking over everything Jessica had said. I didn't know how much longer I could be around Hank without flat-out pouncing on him. Like a junkie, I was jonesing for a romance novel coupling. I needed a pulsating pillar of passion, a mammoth male member, a cocky cobra ready to tangle with my vaginal mongoose.

I also needed to think about upgrading my reading. My imagery was actually starting to bother me.

When I got back to the house, I saw Hank feeding the chickens. I automatically added a bounce to my step. "Hey there, Hank," I cooed.

" 'Sup?"

"I'm leaving to go back to Philly tomorrow. Will you watch over everything for me while I'm gone?"

"That's my job." He tossed more feed to the chicken.

I sighed.

"Philly? Is that where you're from?" he asked, and my heart damn near leapt out of my chest. An honest-to-God question!

"Yes! That's where I'm from."

"Oh," he said, then looked me in the eyes. "I like their cheese."

Huh? Their cheese? Oh! "Sure, Philly cream cheese. Good stuff. I like it too," I said, grinning broadly.

"I like it on bagels," he said. "But not on toast."

Instantly my mind dreamed up a vision of Hank naked in bed, with a nice big bagel around his-

"Toast with jam is good, though. I like jam," he said, bringing me back from my daydreams.

Ah. Okay. Still talking about breakfast foods.

"Jam is good." What was not good was this conversation. How could I turn this into something a bit more sexy, a bit more sensual, a bit more turn-me-around-and-plow-into-me-from-behind, please, and thank you very much.

Talk about things he was interested in, something that might lead to him being interested in how interesting I was. "So. Hank. I was thinking. Maybe when I get back we could arrange a riding lesson?"

"Riding?" he asked, throwing the last bit of the feed to the chickens and heading for the barn.

"Yeah, take the horses out? I haven't been riding since I was a kid, but maybe you could teach me? Get me comfortable again?"

He paused then, turned, and looked at me. Hard. My heart pounded. We stared at each other across the barnyard, chickens running here and there. They were obviously affected by the animal magnetism pulsing across the space between us, the man finally seeing the woman as she was. His stare was as hard as I hoped he'd be. He opened that perfect mouth to say-

Toot toot!

Dammit. Clark was stopping by this morning to go over the bid from the contractor I liked the best. Also the one who wanted to make the most changes, so I was ready for a fight.

He pulled into the driveway and sprang from the car, a scone in his hand and a smile on his face. Which faltered slightly when he saw Hank and me having a stare-off across some chickens.

When the Cowboy saw the Librarian? He approached, scattering fowl left and right. Slowly but purposefully he strode, even when he trod directly on a dried corncob. He stood right in front of me, his gaze drifting down to my now-heaving bosom, then meeting my eyes again from underneath his lashes. His look was heavy, and pointed, and smoldering. His lips parted, his tongue darting out to wet his lips. "You think you wanna ride, huh?"

"Ride?" I whispered, not even able to summon the breath required to make my vocal cords work.

"Yeah. Ride," he echoed, nodding toward the barn. "When you come back in town? I'll take you out for a ride. Think you can handle it bareback?"

Sweet merciful God.

I never really understood what it meant when I read the term "my knees buckled." I now know. Luckily there was a cowboy to catch me. His skin burned when he wrapped his fingers around my biceps, literally holding me up in midair as I struggled to find my footing. I breathed in, his scent filling my nostrils. Sweat. Sweet hay. Heat. Could a man smell like heat? He did.

I took another hit-and sneezed. But this time at least I managed to do it a little more daintily.

He chuckled as he set me back on my feet, turned me clockwise, and with a tiny push sent me back toward the house. "Hey, Clark," I heard Hank say with a self-satisfied voice behind me. I floated on a puffy white cloud of dazed hormones to the back door, where Clark was now waiting for me with a frown.

"Hey, Clark," I echoed, as he held the door open for me and I hovered inside, still a few feet off the ground.

Still in a trance, I drifted over to the kitchen table, where I finally came to rest in a chair. My brain was scrambled, everything south of my navel was clenching a phantom dick, and my ears kept repeating a word that I never knew could be so sensual, so sexual, so full of promise. I repeated it in my head, over and over again, trying it out in different ways.

Bareback.

Bareback.

Bareback.

"Horseshit."

"What?" I asked, ripped from my fluffy sex cloud.

"Horseshit," Clark said again, pointing toward my shoe. In my trance, I'd stepped right in it.

"Dammit." I sighed, lifting it immediately and seeing the tracks I'd made on the clean floor. I started to hop toward the door, but on my second hop I stumbled and pitched forward. I would have gone through the screen door but for Clark, who caught me tight around the waist.

Crushed against his chest, my nose was filled with the scent of Irish Spring soap and paperback books. Immediately I was brought back to the scent of the library back home, that homey scent of sun-touched book spines and thick yellowed paper, a quiet afternoon in the stacks.

He set me down before I could think on it too long, however, and helped me back outside. Hank's truck was thundering away in the distance, and I set to wiping my shoe off in the gravel. After dragging it around a few times I looked up to the porch where Clark was standing, studying me. I got it mostly clean, but still took my shoes off before starting back for the porch.

"Gross, huh?"

"I'll say," he muttered, then looked like he was going to say something else. He didn't though, and when I came back up the stairs he just held the door open for me.

"There's bleach under the counter," he said, going to get a roll of paper towels from the pantry. "Let's get this cleaned up."

"Oh, God, Clark, you don't have to clean this up, it's my mess. I'll take care of it." I took the paper towels from his hands and grabbed the bleach. It was right where he said it was. He really had been here a lot in the last few weeks. "I got the bid from the last contractor, you want to get it? It's on the mantel. Could we look through it together?" I asked, bending down to spray some bleach. "That way instead of sending me texts about things you don't want done you can just tell me to my face, and then I'll yell back at you in person. Sound good?" I wiped up the last bit of shoe mess and threw everything into a plastic bag, tying it off to go out to the trash.

When I turned around though, he was still standing there. Looking at me. With an indecipherable expression on his face.

"Cat got your tongue?"

"Hmm?"

"You look like you've got something to say. What's up?" I asked, washing my hands, then turning to lean against the sink. He opened his mouth, then closed it, then opened it again.

"You look like a goldfish, Clark, out with it," I teased, and he turned bright red.

"Just forget it," he said, walking toward the door.

"Hey, wait, where are you going? Aren't you going to look at the bid?" I asked, reaching out to stop him. I grabbed his arm, and he glanced down at my hand.

"Do you have any idea how dangerous it is to ride bareback, Vivian?"

"Huh?"

"Bareback. On a horse. Ring any bells?" he asked, frowning now.

"Oh! Bareback! Right. Um, well, I'm sure we won't actually-"

"Because it's very dangerous. Especially for someone who hasn't done any riding in a while. Things like that should be taken slow. And steady. And not rushed."

I could hear the old grandfather clock ticking in the dining room. I could smell the briny ocean air. I could feel the nubby texture of the tweed in Clark's jacket, rough yet soft under my fingertips. And I could see his eyes behind those eyeglasses, dark chocolate swirled through with gold and green. Patient. Kind. Waiting?

His hand reached up to cover mine, then lifted it from his arm. "I'll see you when you get back."

He picked up his briefcase and his scones, and pushed open the door.

"Wait! Clark!" He turned around. "Don't you want to, you know, um ... see the bid?"

The right corner of his mouth lifted in a secretive smile. "I trust you'll pick the right one." He left.

As I packed, the house felt really big for some reason.

The next morning, I left for Philadelphia.

Chapter eleven

The five-hour plane ride gave me a lot of time to think, to read, and then think some more. Excited as I was to see my family, I missed Mendocino within five minutes of putt-putting around that last bend in the road and leaving it behind.

I did not at all miss the tiniest rental car in America, turning it in at SFO. With any luck, when I got back to Mendocino I'd have the Blue Bomber 2.0 to toot about town in.

I read through the proposal my father had sent while I was on the plane, it was a good offer. I'd saved my own money over the last few years, sure, but this would really set me up for a while. I'd called the last contractor before I'd left, accepted his bid, and he'd be able to start working soon after I returned.

I was still puzzling over why Clark didn't go through the bid with me. I imagined that once the work began he'd start back up with his fussing and mussing, but until then, I was going to focus on what I did have control over. The sale of my company, the packing of my apartment, the selling of my car.

I settled back, reclining my seat as far as it would go.

My mom and dad picked me up at the airport, showered me with hugs and kisses, and then immediately took me home to feed me. I wasn't even allowed to go to my apartment first. It was to my mother's dining room table, where all my favorite foods were on display. Roast chicken, mashed potatoes, homemade gravy, and a huge bowl of peas. "Peas for color" my mother always used to say, a phrase she'd appropriated from my grandmother, who always felt there should always be a little green on each place.

I enjoyed it all, and was tucking into my second piece of big, luscious double-chocolate cake with cocoa buttercream frosting when my father poured me a cup of coffee and sat down beside me, sweeping away crumbs with his fingertips. This signaled the serious conversation portion of our dinner.

"So, you read the proposal, I take it?" he asked, and I nodded through a mouthful of chocolate.

"And?"

"And," I said, pausing to swallow, "everything looks really good. A few things here and there that I'd like to tweak, but essentially? You've got yourself a deal."

My mother burst into tears at her end of the table. "It's so silly to cry. It's not like I didn't know this was going to happen, it just ... seems so final now. You're really moving." She dabbed at her eyes with her napkin.

"Mom, it's gonna be okay, you'll see. Give me some time to get the house in order and then you can come out and play, okay?"

"But you'll be so far away!" she wailed.

"Gee, if only there was a way you could fly out there-like, on a plane? To visit?" I said, making a show of puzzling over this predicament. Was I teasing her? Oh my yes, it was the only way to get her to stop crying. And sure enough ...

"Don't sass your mother, Vivvie, I know very well that I can come out for a visit. But it isn't the same, and you know it." She was pointing at me now, and when that finger went out, a lecture was sure to follow.

"I know you said that you have a friend who will help you with the decorating, but there's no reason at all why you should be spending that kind of money when I can come out to help you. You'll see, I'll have that place shipshape in no time."

Right on schedule with the lecture ...

"And another thing, this Clark character. I don't like him giving you so much trouble. It's your home and you should do with it as you please. The idea that he would-"

"Ma."

"-have the nerve to tell you what you can and can't-"

"Ma! Clark is under control. You don't think I can handle a librarian?"

"He's a librarian?"

"He's the town librarian, he's an archivist, and he's the head of the local historical society. He knows a lot about the town, a lot about the house too. He even helped Aunt Maude get it listed on the historical register. That's the only reason he's so involved with this project-he needs to make sure that the changes that we make are within the time period of the home."

"Hmmm."

"He's a total pain in the ass, but kind of-I don't know, in a good way? I hate to admit it, but he's had some good ideas." God, he would just looooove to know I was saying such good things about him. "Oh, and you should see what we came up with for the front porch! Remember how I told you the floor was all rotted, how I went through it the first night? And then again another night?"

"You went through the front porch twice?" my father asked, looking surprised as he shot a glance toward my mother. She shushed him and waved for me to go on.

"Didn't I tell you about the second time? Yeah-after Clark had to pull me up through the floorboards, he agreed that we needed to start with the porch. And he suggested restoring the old porch swing. Remember that, Mom?" I asked, grabbing for my phone.

"I think so, off to the left?" she asked, watching me carefully.

"Yep. Aunt Maude seemed to have used an entire roll of duct tape to hold it together. I've got a picture here somewhere," I said, scrolling through my camera roll on my phone. "Yes, here we go! Can you believe how wretched this thing looks? But Clark knows a carpenter who does a lot of restoration work. He thinks that-"

"Clark again? Who is this guy?" my father asked, looking between the two of us.

"I have a pretty good idea," my mom said, looking at the picture I was showing her. "Is that him?" she asked me.

"Huh? Oh yeah, that's him." The porch swing was in the center of the picture, but without realizing it I'd included Clark in the shot. Standing next to it, elbow patches large and in charge, hands on his hips as he wore an assured half grin. He'd thought he'd just won an argument about the status of the baluhwhozit. Little did he know that the longer I was in the house, the more inclined I was to keep it as original as I could. But what would be the fun in letting him know that?

I smiled in spite of myself, noticing the way the late-afternoon sun caught the planes of his face, how strong the jaw, how tousled the tie. Clark let loose a bit later in the day, literally loosening his tie as the day crept on.

"He's a good-looking man," my mom said, bringing me back from the little town of Mendocino, where the late-afternoon sun could be very illuminating.

"Yeah, I suppose he is. So annoying, but a pretty good guy."

She nodded and patted my father's hand. "Let's let Vivvie worry about what's happening with the house. Sounds like she's got a pretty good handle on it."

"If you need some help, Peanut, just let us know. Or maybe we should just plan on coming out there-don't you think this is a lot to take on?" my father said, looking to my mother for support.

I braced myself, knowing I was going to have to fend them both off, but she surprised me when she shook her head.

"Vivvie's got this. We'll come out when everything is how you want it," she told me with a wink.

"Wow. Okay, sounds good," I said, eyes wide and disbelieving.

"Now, let's talk about helping you pack up and move out of that apartment. If you don't think you're going to take much of your furniture, I was thinking that we could donate some of your things to the church. They need a couch for the Sunday school downstairs, and the women's shelter is always looking for kitchenware. How about we start sorting through those things tomorrow?" My mom had that look on her face whenever she was starting a new project. That look always made me nervous.

"Sure. Let's start tomorrow." I nodded, sipping my coffee and looking at my father. He knew that look also, and to not mess with her. So a packing we will go ...

My phone rang at 1:17 in the morning. One guess who was on the other end ...

"Explain to me why no one in California can tell time. Is it the laid-back attitude? The sun shining too brightly to see your watch?" I growled.

"Vivian?"

"You called me, Clark. You don't know who you're talking to?"

"Let's see ... aggressive, sarcastic, an all-around pleasure to be with ... Yeah, I know exactly who I called," he said with a low chuckle.

"I'm sound asleep and you're picking apart my delivery?" I yawned, sinking back and scrunching up my pillow under my head.

"Impossible woman," he said, almost under his breath. "I was calling about the Legless Knight."

"You're kidding, right?"

"Do I sound like I'm kidding?"

"To be fair, I've never heard you kidding. Who knows what you sound like?"

"You've never heard me do a number of things, Vivian. You have no idea what I might sound like."

Ah. Nighttime Clark. I curled onto my side, cuddling the blanket a little tighter. "Okay, I'll bite. What in the world is so important about the Legless Knight that you had to call me after one in the morning?"

"You'll bite?" he asked.

I clutched at the pillow a little more. "Clark ..." I warned.

I got another chuckle. "I was thinking that perhaps we were a little too quick to get rid of him. After all, he'd been the man around the house for quite some time. Perhaps he should stay around a little longer?"

"You were the one that said that not everything was worth keeping. Which was impressive by the way, and correct. There was entirely too much house packed into that house." But I had to admit I'd been a little sad to see the knight go. "Besides, who knows where he even is now, since John took him to the antiques store?"

"Actually, the knight stayed with him. He thought he might want it for the restaurant. I think his exact words were 'might add a touch of class to the patio.' "

"Not really sure a medieval theme is the right message you want on a restaurant patio." I laughed.

"Exactly what I told him when I went to bring it back."

"Wait, so you already went and got him?"

"I did."

"You were sure I'd say yes to bringing him back to the house?"

"I was."

"You're a little full of yourself, aren't you?"

"I am."

"So what the hell did you call me for? Sounds like you've got it all worked out already, Clark," I said, rolling over on my back. "You sure that's the only reason you called?"

It was silent on the other end of the phone. Except for the almost imperceptible sound of him taking a sip of what I assumed was Scotch. Water. Neat. An image rose in my mind: Clark, sitting low in a leather armchair, one hand on the phone, the other on his glass. Hair, unparted and messy. Eyeglasses, abandoned for the evening next to a book on the side table. Jeans. White button-down, untucked and the top two buttons undone. Blue tie, loosened but not untied. A five o'clock shadow that had progressed to scruffy goodness.

I pulled my pillow from behind my head and covered my face to muffle my giggle. What in the world had gotten into me?

Then I heard him take a breath. Deep, prolonged, and almost ... shaky? Almost a ... shudder?

My own breath? Caught. Held hostage by a librarian three thousand miles away who called me in the middle of the night to ask me about a bisected suit of armor.

I held so very tight to my pillow.

"You want to know if that's the only reason I called, Vivian?" he asked finally, his voice octaves and octaves lower than Daytime Clark. Raspy, gruff, rough-and-tumble.

"Uh-huh?" I squeaked.

"That's the only reason," he said. "Have a good night. Sweet dreams."

He hung up.

I buried my head into the pillow, kicking my legs into the air.

Eventually, I slept.

But sweet dreams? Not in the slightest. Salty? Hell, yes.

Over the next week, my activities mirrored what I'd been doing on the West Coast. Except instead of packing up someone else's things, now they were mine. My things, my clothes, my pictures, my knickknacks and paddywacks and everything I owned. It was easier and harder than I thought it would be. Harder, because I was hanging my hat in a new state, and new state of mind. I was leaving my family and my brothers' families.

Yet it was also easier, because I was ready to sink my teeth into the renovation and get started on whatever was coming next. Easier because I missed waking up to the sound of the waves crashing, missed the fresh sea air and rocking in my old lady rocking chair on the back porch while the sun set on the ocean, Scotch in hand.

Mendocino was on my mind, but Philadelphia would always have a piece of my heart. And part of that piece of my heart was currently in the kitchen, packing up my collection of refrigerator magnets. My mother insisted on wrapping each one of them in tissue paper, even though there was nothing remotely fragile or breakable about a magnet that said "I got crabs in Key West, Florida." Stone crabs, to be clear. Good eating. My magnet collection was my one spot of tacky chaos in my chaos-free apartment.

"Ma, you really don't have to do that, seriously. Just throw them in a box, it's all good," I said, walking past her on the way to the living room, where the fort of boxes was getting higher and higher. Clothes, personal items, artwork-both mine and some I'd purchased over the years. My furniture was either going into storage (read: my parents' basement), being donated, or being appropriated by a brother. My mountain bikes were bound for Cali, same for my kayaks. I couldn't wait to get out on the trails and into the water out there.

"Since when do you just throw anything into a box?" my mother asked.

"What does that mean?" I asked her, grabbing for the tape roll that she held just out of reach.

"The daughter I know likes everything neat and orderly."

"I still do. I'm just thinking that they'll be going back up all messy and random, so it's not necessary to make it perfect inside the box, right?" I shrugged.

Perhaps a little touch of California had already made its way into my sensibilities. Wasn't the worst thing that could happen.

Clark continued to call me while I was back east, not every night and not always at the same time. But late enough and with enough regularity that I went to bed each night wondering whether Nighttime Clark would be making an appearance. And more often than not, he did.

"Wait a minute, just wait a damn minute. Chess team? Please tell me you're joking," I said during one phone call. I was lying in my bed, eating Sour Patch Kids and asking Clark about his high school days. A few nights ago we'd started chatting about grade school, progressed on to everyone's least-favorite and most-awkward junior high years, and had finally made it to high school.

"Chess team was serious business. Do you know how great that looks on a transcript? Colleges eat that shit up." He laughed and sipped his Scotch. Three hours ahead of him I wasn't indulging at the same time he was, but it did make for a more relaxing conversation. And for a looser Clark.

"Wow. I don't think I've ever heard you curse before, Mr. Barrow."

"I'm sure I have," he said.

"Nope, pretty sure you haven't. Although I've gotten a few willy-nillys and a holy mackerel and-"

"I've never said holy mackerel and you know it," he interrupted me, and I laughed.

"Oh yes you have; it was when I was going to throw away the moth-eaten blanket that was on the back of the couch in the living room. You launched into this tirade about how it was an authentic Adirondack woolen blanket, extremely rare for California, as they were typically found in upstate New York, from the old camps where wealthy families would go to escape the heat of Manhattan and Philadelphia and Boston at the turn of the last century, and that we couldn't possibly throw it away. That it would be akin to trashing Americana as we know it," I said, snorting a little at the end.

There was a long pause.

"You have a stunning memory, Vivian," he finally said, a hint of humor in his voice. I'd been worried I'd hurt his feelings.

"Sometimes I do, I suppose. About some things."

I switched positions on the bed, getting more comfortable. "So, chess team, huh? Tell me more about that."

"What did you just do? You sound different," he said.

"I just turned around in bed, I had my feet up against the wall before."

"And now?"

"Now?"

"Mm-hmm," he breathed.

Nighttime Clark. I grinned into the darkness.

"I'm lying the right way," I said, my voice lifting a little at the end.

"I wasn't aware there was a right way to lie in bed, Vivian," he said, his voice deepening, going all warm honey.

"Depends on the bed, I suppose," I teased.

"Depends on the body, I'd suppose," he teased right back, and just like that, my skin pebbled. "Tell me all about the right way," he said, with more of the warm gooey.

Officially? I was lying on my back with my head on the pillow, my legs under the blanket. But unofficially?

"I'm stretched out on my back, arms over my head, my legs barely tucked under the comforter since it's so hot in here tonight. I've got one hand twisted in my hair, and my other hand is holding ... you."

I closed my eyes, held my breath, and waited.

Clark. Groaned. Deep.

Holy mackerel.

Two nights later I was on my back again with Clark in my ear, telling me about his favorite spots to kayak on the Big River.

"It's not too swift there; just enough current that you can relax and go where the river wants you to. The trees on either side, the sound of the water, there's nothing like it," he said, slipping into that low and melodic voice that came at night. After hours.

"Well you're in luck, because I'm bringing my kayak back with me," I said, taking a swig from the water bottle next to my bed. "Two in fact, if you want to borrow one."

"I also have my own, but thanks for the offer," he said. "Maybe we'll have to take them out sometime, see how they do."

"Whether they'll play nice together?" I laughed, rolling over onto my side.

"You must know all about that. With five brothers, I imagine 'play nice' is like a mantra."

"It was the opposite-we played hard and rough most of the time. They never went easy on me just because I was a girl. They knew I'd punch them if I thought that they were."

"I believe you. Receiving end over here and all," he teased.

"Never going to let me forget that, are you Clark? Besides, you snuck up on me. You're lucky no nuts were kicked."

"I realize you think you're being funny, but with five brothers, I'm amazed you could even joke about that."

"Believe me, I've seen my share of nuts kicking, accidental or otherwise. And I bet you just curled up over there like a roly-poly, didn't you?"

"Can we talk about something else, please?"

"Sure, anything you like, Clark. What do you want to talk about? It's your dime."

"Why do I feel like this just turned into one of those 900 calls?"

"Do you want me to call you Big Daddy?" I giggled into the phone, in my sexiest kitten voice.

"Vivian," he warned.

"Just kidding. Tell me something I don't know about you."

"Something? There's plenty you don't know," he said with a laugh.

"Okay, so tell me about plenty."

"Are you serious?"

"Loosen up, librarian, and gimme the good stuff," I said deadpan, and he chuckled. "So I'll start it. Favorite cereal?"

"Oatmeal," he said.

"I love oatmeal! With brown sugar?"

"Molasses. And dried cherries. Occasionally chocolate chips."

"That sounds amazing." I sighed. I'd have to try it sometime. "Okay now, favorite movie?"

"Just one?" he asked.

"Deserted island, you can only take one DVD."

"There's a DVD player on this deserted island?"

"You're not playing the right way," I told him, scissoring my legs so that one was on top and one was under the covers. I was both hot and cold at the same time.

"Well in that case, I guess I'd take ... wow, that's really a hard one."

"We haven't even gotten to hard yet, Clark," I teased, and bit down on my knuckle when he muttered something under his breath.

"All right then, let's move on to hard," he said.

"Biggest regret?" I asked quickly.

"Don't have any," he answered back, just as quickly.

"Oh, come on."

"No, really. Sure, there are things I wished had gone other ways, but mostly those have been out of my control. I think if you have regrets, they'll start to eat at you. And who wants to live in the past?"

"Good answer," I said, then fired another question before he could ask me about my regrets. "Biggest turn-on?"

"A woman who takes what she wants, when she wants it," he answered back just as quickly, and I quickly pulled my other leg out from under the covers. Not so much cold now. Nighttime Clark was going to be the death of me.

"Biggest goal in life?" I asked, to steer the conversation back to safer ground. Hearing him tell me about working for the Smithsonian or the New York Public Library would be a good way to cap off the night.

But for the first time, he hesitated.

"Clark?" I asked.

"Biggest goal in life, huh?" he asked.

"Uh-huh."

"Promise you won't laugh?"

"Yes," I promised, wondering where this was going.

"I feel like I should say something like climb Mount Rainier. But you want the truth? My real, biggest goal in life?"

"Yes," I whispered, holding my breath.

"To fall in love with an amazing girl, get married, and fill up a huge house with a whole mess of kids."

I couldn't breathe.

"So old-fashioned, I know," he said with a slight laugh. "Not like the mountain climbing, right?"

I finally found my voice. It was buried, you see, behind this lump that kept showing up lately. "No mountain climbing, Clark. Go with the other," I whispered. "It sounds pretty great."

"It does?"

"Oh, yeah," I answered. "Who wouldn't want that?"

My hand actually hurt from clutching the phone so tightly.

It was my last night back east. Everyone was at my parents' house, the table surrounded by my family, immediate and extended. The table was extended too, bursting with enough casserole dishes and serving platters to feed the Franklin army. We laughed, we yelled, we joked, we teased, we ate. It was everything I'd be missing every single Sunday, and somewhere between the scalloped potatoes and the triple-layer strawberry shortcake, my heart was full to bursting.

Feeling a little overwhelmed, I left the table and went to the back porch, wrapping my arms around myself to fend off the chilly air. And the melancholy.

"It's too much sometimes, isn't it?" I heard, and saw a puff of smoke coming from behind the boxwoods framing the swimming pool.

"You know she'll kill you if she catches pipe tobacco on your clothes," I warned, knowing my mom's thoughts on my father's smoking. He'd cut down considerably as he'd gotten older, but she still got on his case about it.

"I'll tell her it was Peterson next door. She'll never know the difference," he said, blowing a few smoke rings my way.

"Right, because Mom was born yesterday. She's looks good for only being a day old." I crossed over to him as he tapped his pipe out on the bottom of his shoe.

We looked up at the stars for a minute. It was a clear night with a bright moon.

"Peanut. Have I told you how proud I am of you?"

Straight shot to the gut. Not to mention the tear ducts.

"Where did that come from?" I asked. My father was a man of few words when it came to raw emotion.

"I have no idea what you're up to out there, and it scares the hell out of me. But I haven't seen you this fired up since you left for Paris, and that scared the hell out of me too. So I figure you must be on to something."

"Wow, I-"

"I wasn't finished. You let me get this out, okay?"

I nodded, and he took a deep breath.

"I'm sorry I didn't insist you wear dresses. I'm sorry you got a baseball before a Barbie. I'm sorry I didn't let you paint in the house with your watercolors in second grade, and I'm sorry that when your mother wanted you to take tap dance instead of soccer, I didn't listen to her. I'd say I'm sorry that you went into computers, but I'm not. You've got a good head for it; you just don't have the heart. And if you hadn't gone into computers, then I wouldn't be able to buy you out and help us both at the same time.

"And I'm very glad to be helping you now, since I didn't before when I should have." He squeezed my shoulder, then let go. "That's all I'm going to say. But I'm damn proud of you."

Tears burned as I looked up at my father.

He cleared his throat, then squeezed my shoulder one more time. "Let's get some of that shortcake before your brothers eat the whole damn thing."

Color me surprised. Color me wrecked. Color me Peanut.

"All packed?" Clark asked late that night.

"I think so. Everything that's being shipped has already gone out. I sold my car yesterday, so I've got that extra to go toward Seaside Cottage. I was thinking of installing a skylight, or maybe even an aboveground pool in the front yard," I said, yawning into the phone. I was spending this last night at my parents', since I was now officially moved out of my apartment.

"You never miss an opportunity to mess with me, do you Vivian?" He sighed. "What time is your flight tomorrow?"

"I get into SFO around eleven thirty. You should have heard me on the phone with the rental car people, making sure no putt-putt would be issued this time. Hopefully I won't have to drive it for very long. Any word on the Bel Air?"

"You'll be glad to know they delivered it this morning. It's waiting for you when you get home."

I let out an excited yelp, which I then tried to muffle with the pillow. Too late, I heard bare feet coming down the hallway. I rolled over, hiding the phone just before my mother opened the door.

"Vivvie, it's past two in the morning! You have to be up in a few hours. We have to be up in a few hours, for that matter. Who in the world are you on the phone with?"

"Clark," I said to my mom, but he answered as though I was talking to him. "Not you, be quiet," I whispered into the phone, and looked back at my mother. "Don't worry, I'm getting off soon."

"Tell him good night and go to sleep," she said, closing the door. I giggled. "Now," she said through the door, and I rolled my eyes.

"I'm back," I said, into the phone, whispering even softer than before.

"Why are you whispering?" he whispered back. "Wait, why am I whispering?"

"My mom just told me to get off the phone. Jesus, I haven't heard that in ten years. She never liked it when I was on the phone late, especially with boys."

"My, my, Vivian, did you have a lot of boyfriends in high school?"

"A lot? No. A few? Yes."

"Anyone special?"

"Special at the time, I guess," I said, rolling away and facing the wall.

"Oh come on, you didn't have some angsty teenage romance?" he asked.

"Not really. Actually, the truth is, most of my relationships have been of the physical variety, not so much emotional." I sighed into the phone. Feeling bold here in the dark, and three thousand miles away from the person I was admitting things to, I pressed on. "Want to know a secret?"

"About you? I'm all ears."

I took a breath, and closed my eyes. "I've never been in love before," I admitted, wincing. Hearing those words out loud just made it feel more real.

It was silent on his end. Except for his breathing.

"Say something," I muttered, my face hot.

"It's okay, Vivian, I've never said those words, either. I mean, you know. I love you," he said quietly.

"I love you?" I asked, and I heard him take a deep breath.

"Yes."

We breathed. The phone crackled. Three thousand miles was a long way.

"But you've dated, right? I mean, there must be preppy girls lined up to take a twirl with the cute librarian." I laughed, breaking the tension.

"You think I'm cute?" he said with a laugh, and I rolled my eyes.

"Yes, you're cute. Now spill it. Tell me all about your dirty dating secrets."

"In high school? No, not at all," he said, his voice taking on an almost wistful tone. I thought back to Hank's comment about him walking into the glass door at a party. And what he'd said about chess club. In my head I could see a snapshot of what he must have been like in high school, and I could draw my own conclusions about what his experience might have been like.

"In college?" I asked, trying to imagine a younger Clark on campus. I wondered if he rocked the elbow patches then, or if that was a postgraduate addition.

"Did I date in college?"

"Mm-hmm," I responded, curling my legs underneath me. I chewed on my thumbnail while I waited for his response.

"Some."

"And after college?"

"Some."

"And after after college?"

"After after college?"

"Yeah, you know. Recent. Current. Whatever," I asked, chewing harder on my nail. He let loose one of those low chuckles. I bit the nail clean off. Without thinking, I spat it out.

"Did you just spit something?" he asked, sounding curious and amused.

Mortified, burying my face in the pillow, I answered a muffled yes.

"Never would have pegged you as a spitter, Vivian."

Eyes suddenly wide, I sat straight up, almost levitating from the bed, then rallied. "Only when it's something not worth swallowing."

Hello line, I believe I just crossed over you. I distinctly heard Clark choke on a sip of what I assumed was his Scotch.

I looked at the clock and saw how late it was. "I better go; I have to get up very early. See you tomorrow?"

"That's a promise, Vivian," he said, that deep, warm-honey voice running all over me. "And for the record? I'm not spoken for."

I let out a shuddery sigh. We said our good-nights, I hung up the phone, and tried to go to sleep.

The next morning I kissed my parents good-bye and boarded a plane to California, with no idea of which Clark might be waiting for me when I got home.

It wasn't until somewhere over Utah that I realized I hadn't thought about the cowboy once the entire time I was gone. Huh.

Chapter twelve

Thankful for the large SUV, as I had more luggage than a few weeks ago, I drove from San Francisco to Mendocino on pins and needles. Last time my excitement came from nervous anticipation, because I had no idea what I was walking into. This time I knew what I was coming home to. The question was, what was the most exciting part? My new life? The house itself? The libr-

Whoa. I can't even think it.

As I navigated up Highway 1, taking the longer route for the more scenic view, I felt my skin begin to sink back into the deep blues and vibrant greens of the coast, the craggy cliffs and rich brown earth. Wild and rough, this part of the country was certainly among the most beautiful in the world.

Making that last turn and seeing Mendocino on the horizon made my heart beat a little bit faster. The quaintness overwhelmed me once more, the cottages flush with shrub roses and hollyhocks, trellises covered with flowering vines and saturated with fat bumblebees zinging this way and that. It was warm today, the chill of early autumn chased away by a sultry inland breeze and the enormous sun. I smiled to see the drugstore, the grocery store, John's restaurant, and Cliffside Coffee, bustling with locals and tourists. Was I a local yet? I wondered how long that might take ...

As I turned down Maple, Whispering Canyon came into view. Turrets, wide but dangerous porch, bright clean windows, and ... oh, snap. There she is!

Parked in the driveway was the Blue Bomber. Two point motherfucking 0. "Yes!" I yelled out, almost forgetting to put my rental car into park. I slid out from behind the seat belt and danced to the Bel Air, which looked like it was ready to fly. Top down, chrome sparkling, it was a killer car. And dangling from the rearview mirror? Fuzzy dice. Yes!

I ran my hands down the smooth lines and the gleaming paint. It was decently waxed and buffed to a picture-perfect shine, and I bent down to admire the fat, puffy whitewall tires.

"Fucking awesome," I breathed, then heard the crunch of footsteps behind me.

I peered around, not yet straightening, to see brown loafers. Brown chinos. Blue-and-green plaid shirt, green knit tie. Tweed jacket. Hands in pockets. Straight, even teeth behind a smile. Dusty eyeglasses, one fingertip pushing them up a perfectly healed nose. Warm brown eyes. Neatly parted wavy brown hair.

"Hiya, Clark," I said, slowly straightening and turning to lean against my car. I smiled as I saw his gaze drop down to my legs, as it often did, and slowly rise up my body. I don't know if all librarians ogled the way this one did, but he had it down to an art form. He took his time, leaving no curve unseen. Did I arch my back when his gaze finally made it to my chest? Of course I did. And was rewarded with a nostril flare, the equivalent of a facial boner.

When his eyes finally made it to mine? His grin deepened. "Vivian," he breathed, in that warm-honey way. But then his grin faltered with shyness. "I trust you had a good flight?"

It was okay; I wasn't really ready to be face-to-face with Nighttime Clark. Daytime Clark was a piece of work in his own right.

"Seriously? You want to talk about my flight right now?" I asked, pushing my shoulders back more, internally giggling when he immediately pushed his eyeglasses up his nose again.

"Um, well, what did you want to talk about?" He gulped, and I decided to take it easy on him.

I grinned and patted the car. "Let's take this baby out for a spin."

His face flashed something close to gratitude, which was quickly masked. "I trust you have insurance for this car?"

I laughed out loud, which earned me an "impossible woman," but said with a touch more fondness than usual.

I slid in behind the wheel, he took shotgun, and we drove that beauty straight up the coast.

We drove for an hour, passing Fort Bragg and beyond. The coastline was even more wild and curvy up here, just dangerous enough to add an extra thrill to the day. The ribbon of blacktop cut a winding trail along the cliffs, the Pacific crashing on our left, the mountains soaring majestically on our right.

And between me and the mountains? Clark, who regaled me with stories of the pioneers who first settled this coast, the gold miners who brought their families out seeking riches, the towns that rose around a lucky vein and then expired just as quickly when the gold ran out. The pirates that navigated these waters, pillaging and plundering. Oh yes, the plundering.

And in between the stories, we tuned in the local oldies station and gave the Bel Air what it deserved: doo-wop. Rama lama. Shoop shoops. And a few dingdongs for good measure.

It was good, it was easy, it was fun. The car was slick, speedy when the road was straight, and a smooth, easy boat on the curves. A total bubble of awesome. And we rode around in that bubble all afternoon, me and my Bel Air, my librarian, and my shoop shoop.

The librarian.

Yes, that's what I said. The librarian.

We headed toward home as the sun began to sink over the ocean, painting the blue with strands of gold.

When we reached town, Clark directed me to turn left into a driveway.

"Why are we stopping here?" I asked, pulling up next to a perfect saltbox Cape Cod.

"I need to pick something up," he answered, jumping from the car and hurrying around to my side. He held the door open and closed it behind me.

"This is your house?" I asked, looking all around.

"Yes. Why do you sound so surprised?"

"This isn't surprise, this is excitement. I'm dying to see where you live," I announced, running up the front walk. I peered in through the windows on either side of the door and saw books everywhere, stacked neatly on bookcases and on tabletops. An easy chair. The perfect shade of green on the walls, soft and comforting. A fireplace with a stacked stone hearth.

"I have a key, you know," he said, right behind me. I could feel his breath on the top of my head, he was so much taller than I was. "You don't have to look through the windows."

I laughed. "Only if you want to show me."

"Of course I want to show you. But don't you want to see the Legless Knight? He's waiting for you in the garage."

Looking back at the windows, I asked, "Rain check on the house?"

He nodded. "Rain check." Then he led me around the house. In the tidy backyard I saw a fire pit, gas grill, and Adirondack chairs arranged on the patio into conversation circles. He paused next to the garage.

"So the knight's standing guard over the Taurus, is he?" I joked.

"The Taurus is one of the most stolen cars in America, Vivian. Statistically speaking, if you were going to have your own personal knight in shining armor, wouldn't you want him guarding something you knew was likely to be stolen?" He smiled down at me.

"I suppose. Think that's why he was in Aunt Maude's bedroom? Maybe she was afraid someone was going to steal her fourteenth stack of tube socks."

"Maybe she just got lonely. It happens." He unlocked the door, but still we stood.

"It happens to everyone at some point," I said, aware once more of how much taller he was than me. I was staring at his Windsor knot, loosened as it often was by the end of the day. I could see the tiniest smidge of skin peeking through. It was a tan smidge, and I remembered how sun kissed his chest was that day on the trail.

As my nose caught the scent of warm Irish Spring, I looked up to see his face. He was watching me with an expression I couldn't quite identify.

"Agreed," he murmured.

"Huh?"

"I agree with you. Everyone gets lonely sometimes."

"Not if they have a knight in shining armor, though," I said, and felt a blush creep into my cheeks. Before he could answer and plunge us deeper into the Land of Trite, I saved us both. "Let's get him and bring him back home, okay?"

"Good idea."

Soon we were driving through Mendocino with the knight in the backseat, his legs sticking straight up into the air next to his top.

I caught Jessica's face full of curious as we cruised down the main drag, me, Clark, and a suit of armor in a powder-blue fifties' convertible, blaring doo-wop like it was going out of style. The good news about doo-wop is it never goes out of style.

Still laughing as we pulled into the driveway and around the back of my house, I started when I saw Hank's truck. With one glance, my heart began to pound. I couldn't help it. I could see him in the barn, his naked, sweat-slicked torso instantly arousing my female parts. It wasn't something I could control; it was just hardwired into me when it came to this guy.

I sat in the driver's seat, drumming my thumbs on the wheel. I didn't even notice Clark getting out of the car until he was standing next to me, thumping on the door. I dragged my eyes away from the barnyard p**n to see Clark's head down, his eyes averted. I looked back toward the barn and saw Hank taking notice. And now walking toward us. I quickly climbed out of the car, Clark closing the door with a soft thwack.

"Vivian, if I could just-"

"Viv," Hank called out.

Hank in motion is something I can't accurately describe, except to say that the pecs, the abs, the slick, the meat, the blond, the casual, the intent, the command of everything in his reach is utterly, literally, awesome. After two weeks of no Hank, I was now in the full flush of a direct dose, and it was too much for my system. What was it about this guy that turned me to mush like nobody's business?

The truth is, I'd always had a weakness for a bad boy, the hard-to-get boy. On the page, the heroine was always attracted to the pirate, the rogue prince, the dark rider. And while a prince charming occasionally turned my head, the dirty-talking prince from the enemy camp stole my heart without fail. And my petticoat. The conscious, smart part of me knew this man was no good for me. But the unconscious part of me hijacked my hormones whenever he was within orbit. The primitive need to be invaded by the strongest member of the pack sent me tits up and out, ready to be mounted.

Luckily, the conscious Viv won out today. So when Hank finally made it across the yard, I was breathing steadily.

Someone next to me was not.

"Back from Pittsburgh already, huh?" Hank asked, coming to a stop in front of me, an inch or two closer than societal standards. And deliberately so. He looked me up and down, and my stupid breath wanted to come faster.

"She's from Philadelphia. Not Pittsburgh."

Clark was closer than he'd been a moment ago; I could feel his tension through his jacket and into my arm. His Irish Spring was especially sharp and spicy.

"Oh hey, Clark, I didn't even see you there. What's going on, you two out for a joyride?" Hank deliberately stepped between us to have a look at the car.

Clark, ever the gentleman, allowed it, but I could see that his lips had disappeared. Which for Clark, I had a feeling, meant he was just below furious.

"You guys been at the junkyard? What the hell is that?" Hank laughed, pointing at the knight in the backseat.

"Hey, don't go poking fun at Legless. He's the best," I said, patting the knight on the shoulder.

"Legless-wasn't that the blond guy with the arrows in that movie? Ring Lords or something?"

Clark closed his eyes. His lips reappeared and were now counting to ten.

"Legolas is in the movie. Legless is coming back inside-right, Clark?" I asked, reaching out to rub his arm.

Hank's eyes followed it like a hawk. He looked at the two of us, then grinned like he knew a secret. And it wasn't a grin I liked very much; it changed his face from a thing of beauty into something different.

A face I had a gut feeling Clark had seen before. I had a very sudden and clear picture of what high school must have been like for Hank. And it was a somewhat different picture from how Clark experienced it.

"Well, hey, looks like he might be a bit heavy. Need some help lifting him out of the car?" Hank asked, moving further in between us to grab hold of the knight's shoulders. "Wow, he's pretty heavy. How 'bout I help you out here, eh, Clark?"

I answered first. "Thanks, Hank, that's sweet of you but-"

"I got this," Clark said, grabbing for the shoulders as well, their hands now on the knight.

Me? In between. "Hey guys, how about we just-"

"Oh man, look at your face! It's getting really red! Come on, Clark, let me help Viv with this-it weighs a ton," Hank needled, tugging at the knight. Clark tugged back just as hard, the movement jostling his glasses crooked on his face.

Me? Still in the middle. "Seriously guys, this is silly. How about we-"

"I. Got. This." Clark grabbed once more for the knight and just like that, Hank let go. Tumbling Clark into the backseat.

Tumbling me into Hank. Who caught me tight around the waist. After weeks and weeks, I was finally, blessedly, pressed up against his naked chest.

Hank laughed, clutching me even tighter.

"I got this, Clark," he said, his hands now splayed across my lower back.

We were all frozen in a sick, twisted tableau. Except for Hank's hands, which continued to rove.

I pulled away, something I never thought I'd do in a million years. But he was being a total jerk.

Oh, Christ. Clark.

White-faced, he scrambled up and out of the car, grabbed the other half of the knight, and disappeared into the house without a word.

Hank looked at the other half in the backseat, then at me. "You want some help with that?" he said, his face already losing the intensity that had been on display a moment before.

"No. I'm going to wait for Clark."

He nodded, and was in his truck before I even had a chance to wonder what the hell had just happened.

I heard the porch door bang open and looked up to see Clark barreling down the steps. Still not meeting my eyes, he grabbed the other half and started to head back in. "Hey, wait, let me get the door for you," I said, trying to get there before he did.

But that's not how Clark rolled. Holding the bottom half under his left arm, he held the door open for me. Still looking at the ground, but holding the door open. For me.

I was no fool. I let him. He followed me inside, and when I went left to the living room, he again headed upstairs. It was stuffy inside from being closed up while I was away, and I busied myself opening windows and shoving aside curtains. When I heard him coming down the steps, I turned to face him.

His tie was tied neatly, hair once more parted and neatly combed. The color had come back to his cheeks, and as he pushed his glasses up on his nose I smiled at him, relieved to see that he was okay.

"Vivian, my understanding is that the contractor will be here to begin reviewing the work orders on Friday. Is that still correct?"

My smile fell. "Um, yes. As far as I know, but-"

"And your friend Caroline is also due back this weekend, yes?"

"Yes," I answered frowning at him slightly.

"Very good. I left a few notes for you on some of the changes you want to make; please review them before Friday so we can discuss."

"What?" I asked, confused.

"Friday. It comes after Thursday, which comes after Wednesday, which is preceded by-"

"Clark, stop," I interrupted. "Are we back to this? Listen, I know what happened back there wasn't-"

"Please review the notes before I come back on Friday," he said curtly, and started for the back door.

"Wait, just wait a minute," I said, hurrying to keep up with him. He paused before the door, silhouetted by the setting sun. "I'm not going to see you until Friday?"

"I'm very busy, Vivian, and I've spent enough time on this project already. Please make sure you've gone through those notes." He headed out through the door, stopping when he was at the bottom of the steps. Turning back just slightly, but still not meeting my eyes, he said, "It's going to rain later this week. I noticed while you were gone that the tarp had come loose on the southwest corner, so I took care of it. You shouldn't have any trouble."

"Thank you," I said quietly.

He finally turned back and met my eyes, and I was crushed by the coldness in them. He acknowledged me with a nod, then left.

That night I slept with the knight on guard once more. The chilly ocean wind buffeted the house on all sides, but inside, it was warm.

Well, the house was.

I wasn't.

Chapter thirteen

I looked at the calendar that week more than I did my senior year of high school counting down to the last day of school. I was planning Caroline's visit and getting things ready for the contractor to arrive, making sure I had as much done as I could before the real work started.

I missed Clark. I missed the shit out of him. I was used to him being there, telling me interesting factoids and bits of trivia. Used to him challenging me on everything from the proper way to save photographs to why a properly working fireplace is essential to life as we know it. I was used to his neatly parted hair, his dusty eyeglasses, and his low chuckle when something I did truly tickled him.

I missed his phone calls. I missed the insight into the man behind the tweed, the man who was interested in more than memorabilia and historical significance. I missed the innuendo after he had a Scotch or two and the delicious way his deep voice slid over me. I missed Nighttime Clark a lot.

But Nighttime Clark didn't call.

I finally started cleaning out Aunt Maude's bedroom, the last one to be done. I let the knight keep watch from the hall while I began to declutter, starting with the bowling balls down the center of the bed. I put fresh sheets on, along with a new duvet I'd picked up in town. I cleared out clothes, clutter, and stacks of old mail.

But her closet yielded a fascinating windfall. Buried behind an old chest of drawers, in the deepest part of the closet, was another trove of paintings. I dragged the entire stack out into the late afternoon light and went through them one at a time.

These were not landscapes. They were of a decidedly more intimate nature. Sensual, erotic, beautiful, in fact. The faces were mostly suggested rather than shown clearly, but the one or two that did include features showed that the woman involved was Aunt Maude, and the man was ... No.

"Mr. Montgomery?" I whispered, a violent blush erupting across my face.

Good God damn, this house has seen some funky shit go down. And speaking of going down, please see painting number seventeen. The real eyebrow raiser was painting number eighteen, but my viewing was interrupted by a knock on the front door. For a second my heart began to beat faster in anticipation, until I remembered I'd asked Jessica to help me hang curtains today.

"So tell me all the latest gossip. What's going on with Hunky Hank the cowboy man?" she asked, settling into a rocking chair on the back porch, cold beer in her hand.

I sat down next to her, rolled my eyes at her comment, but offered her a clinking cheers.

"What? Romance novel not quite working out as you'd planned it?"

"No comment," I answered through my smile.

"He doesn't want to saddle up and ride?" she teased, making me laugh in spite of myself.

I thought of the offer he'd made about the bareback and the riding and the everything else. At the time, I'd thought it was exactly what I wanted. I mean, he was the ideal, right?

"All is going according to plan." I sipped my beer.

"I see." We rocked a few times. "You sure about that?"

"Nosy bitch."

"Friendly bitch-there's a difference."

"It's a fine line you walk there."

"The finest," she agreed.

We sipped and rocked some more.

"So this plan of yours. You think that Clark-"

"Jessica? I'm going to need you to drop it, 'kay?"

" 'Kay."

She did. For exactly seven seconds.

"Can I just say one thing?"

I had to laugh. "One thing. Better make it count."

When it came, it was not what I was expecting.

"Okay. Here's my one thing. You think you're living in a romance novel, right?"

"Well, shit, when you put it that way it sounds ridiculous."

"Answer please," she said, looking at me carefully.

"Okay, yes. I admit it. I think I'm living in a romance novel. Go ahead and laugh," I said, rocking a little faster.

"I'm not going to laugh. Because I totally believe you," she said, drinking nonchalantly.

I waited for her to finish, and then grimaced when she didn't. "Okay, ha-ha. What's your actual point?"

"Already made it."

"But wait wait wait-you believe me?"

"Sure do," she said, clinking my beer again.

"Elaborate please," I said, feeling a bit uneasy.

"Don't need to. I agree with you."

"Oh come on, you do not!" I protested.

"Are you this aggressive with all people who agree with you?" She laughed, staring off into the sunset. "We're supposed to get rain later this week, but it sure doesn't look like it right now. Smooth sailing today," she said, changing the subject.

She looked relaxed as she rocked away. I finished my beer, decidedly unrelaxed.

That night when I went up to bed, I looked at my calendar. Tomorrow was Friday. Caroline was coming. The contractor was coming. And the librarian was coming. I shivered under the covers. It must be really cold tonight ...

But I couldn't fool myself anymore. And I'd always been able to do that.

I woke with a start, covered in sweat, so completely turned on that I could barely stand even the touch of the sheets on my skin. I kicked them toward the bottom.

I'd had such a vivid dream, which started the same way it always did. Standing in the doorway, a man approaching me from behind, not sure he was there until I could hear his footsteps on the wood floor. My skin buzzed, feeling how very near this man, this dark lover was, standing now just behind me.

He pressed his nose just below my ear, making me arch into what I hoped was him, but was only empty air. But he was still there, his lips now grazing the same skin, whispering into my ear my name. "Vivian. Sweet, sweet Vivian," he said, a voice so very deep. Deep, like I was longing for him to be inside of me, filling me up with hot, frantic love.

"How long have you been waiting for me? Mmm, your skin is intoxicating. I wonder if your taste will be as sweet as your scent? he murmured, now letting me feel the entirety of his body, molding me to him. Hard, so very hard, and not just the planes of his chest and the iron of his thighs. He was hard for me. Against me, and hopefully soon, finally inside me. I struggled to turn, to see, to touch, but as always he held me facing away.

Yet tonight he went further than he had before, his strong hands tearing the silken gown from my heated skin and letting his palms roam freely across my bare body. Still held hostage against his body, caged in by his powerful arms, I soon found myself pressed against the wall, his hands placing mine above my head, pulling my hips out, making me ready for him.

But not for his impressive erection. No, not yet. My dark lover teased and taunted my br**sts, lightly pulling at my tender flesh, letting his fingertips bring my ni**les to a hardened peak, swirling and dancing across the sensitive tips.

"Do you have any idea what you do to me?" he asked, then dragged his tongue across my nape. I could feel his soft hair as it followed the path his mouth was taking, down down down. Across my shoulder blades, dipping into the hollow between each vertebrae, then finally coming to rest in the small of my back, his teeth gently nipping at the dimple just above my bottom.

His hands? They'd left my br**sts, which were full and infinitely heavy as I arched my back, seeking his attention once more. But his hands were on a southern trajectory, and as they began to explore my innermost secrets, my moans and groans begged him to take me, to push me past this threshold that began to border on pain, the need to be inhabited by him was so great.

"Not so fast, Vivian. You've no idea how much I've wanted this," he whispered, parting me. And then suddenly his heated breath was no longer at my back. The insides of my thighs were tickled by his silky hair, and my knees threatened to give way. I looked down as his hands gently but insistently urged my legs farther apart ... and then, his kisses. Oh, his kisses!

Starting on the backs of my knees, they began to ascend the backs of my thighs, moving steadily inward. His face was still concealed, still hidden. And then?

He put his mouth on me. Glorious. Rapturous. Erotic. Inescapably wanton.

My world stopped-and then started up again, as though anew. As I kept my hands on the wall for support, my cries of passion tumbled toward him. Only a shock of hair was visible in the low light as he buried his mouth between my thighs. I shook and shivered, and as my eyes began to close, I forced them open. I had to see him.

"Vivian," that dark voice rolled through me. "You taste as decadent as I dreamed you would." And just as he began to lift his head and open his eyes-

I awoke.

"Dammit!" I screamed, punching the pillow.

I didn't sleep again that night.

So when Friday dawn arrived? I was one cranky Viv.

Chapter fourteen

Caroline was due to arrive at 10:30 a.m. Since Simon was on location in Mexico, she'd planned on spending the night before heading back into the city. I was glad to have my first houseguest; the quilts were clean and the pillows were plumped.

As I waited, I was still shaken by my dream. Part of me was so angry that I'd almost gotten to see his face, yet another part of me was terrified to see it. Not seeing it meant it was still just a fantasy. A fantasy with the fastest tongue in the West, but a fantasy nonetheless.

Both the librarian and the cowboy had been scarce this week. I hadn't seen Hank once, but I'd seen evidence that he'd been around. Paula was out in the pasture with Paul, the chickens were fed. His tire tracks in the mud after a rainstorm. And of course we know why Clark hadn't been around.

"This project has already taken up enough of my time," he'd said, then left me with a secured tarp and a frown. I'd thought that he'd cave, and Nighttime Clark would call. But both Nighttime Clark and more persnickety Daytime Clark had steered clear all week. He'd finally be here today.

Nervous? Nah. The pacing is my usual cool, calm, and collected self.

The smartest little Mercedes convertible I'd ever seen came up the drive, and Caroline stopped next to the house. "Hey, girl," she called out with a grin. "This house just gets better and better each time I see it."

"Yes, and today's the day we decide how we're making it better," I answered, grabbing her bag out of the backseat and swinging it up onto my shoulder before she had a chance to get it herself.

"You sound like a motivational speaker!" She laughed, stepping from the car and stretching her arms over her head after the long drive. She was dressed for work, long legs encased in trim black pants, a raspberry-colored sweater with a soft pink scarf accenting her long neck. She had the kind of easy good looks I'd always envied-that, and her ability to navigate a gravel driveway in three-inch heels.

"You make that look so easy," I told her, looking down at her shoes as she followed me onto the back porch.

"I learned from the best-you should see my boss walk around a job site. Add sawhorses, electrical cables, and another two inches, and you've got Jillian." She looked around the kitchen. "It looks good in here. I like what you've done."

She examined the open shelves over the stove that I'd cleared off, and then filled with an old set of heavy orange pots and double boilers I'd found in the basement. I'd arranged them by size. "Fuck me, these are all Le Creuset. You brought these with you, or they were here?"

"I found them in the basement behind a bunch of old canning jars."

"Watch them carefully, please, and you might want to go through my bag tomorrow before I leave. If I'm listing to one side, you're for sure going to want to check my duffel," she warned, turning to take in the expanse of cleared counter space. "And you're very lucky that's not a KitchenAid," she finished, pointing to an ancient-looking mixer. I'd left it on the counter, even though I had no idea if I'd ever use it. It looked homey. It felt homey. So it stayed.

I led her upstairs, and she exclaimed in delight over how much progress had been made. I let her pick which guest room she wanted, and she marveled in the view of the ocean. She bounced on the bed, pronounced it good, and then watched me raise and lower the blinds three times until I had them the exact height I wanted. She watched as I made sure the windows were open to the same level, and then she watched as I adjusted the books on top of the dressers, fanned with exactly two inches of space between them.

"You nervous about something?" she asked.

"Nervous? No, why?" I asked, just as the doorbell rang. The books were now all on the floor, the result of my involuntary muscle spasm at the dingdong. I sighed as I bent down to pick up the books.

Jesus, Viv, get a grip.

Caroline watched with raised eyebrows as I said, "Pretty sure Clark's here. I'll go get the door."

I hurried down the stairs, spying the familiar outline on the other side of the lace. It had been a long week. Stomach in knots, I practically jumped the last two steps, flew across the floor, and wrapped my hand around the doorknob. Once there, I finally paused to breathe. What would I find on the other side? Familiar and Funny Friend Clark? Or Distant and Detached Clark?

I opened the door. He filled it. Tall, dark, and tweedy. I smiled without even thinking about it. His brown eyes warmed instantly, taking me in and then, as usual, dropped down to scan me head to toe. Per usual, I let him look. I leaned against the doorframe as he took in my legs, clad in the shortest cutoffs I owned. I didn't really plan out my outfit this morning at all. Not at all ...

When he got to my stomach and its jewelry, his eyes widened. I wore a T-shirt casually knotted in the back to bare my navel. He stopped somewhere around my chest and I puffed up a bit, letting my fingers play with my cameo. He pushed his glasses farther up his nose. The brief perusal felt like hours. And when his eyes finally made it back up to mine, they were warm and kind and happy to see me. But then they became all business.

"I trust you have everything in order before the contractor arrives?"

My stomach rolled over. He was still pissed.

"Good to see you too, Clark. Come on in." I sighed, holding the door open wide and ushering him in. His arm brushed mine and my fingers touched my skin absently as I watched him walk into the room, turning in a circle and examining the work I'd done this week. He raised an eyebrow when he saw the Post-it I'd stuck on the loose newel.

"Don't start. I'm only asking if they can restore it, not replace it. Happy?"

"Yes, that's exactly the word I'd use to describe myself," he muttered, loud enough for me to hear.

I stifled a snappy remark, watching him from the door. "So, how was your week?" I asked.

"Busy," he said, now examining the wood-framed mirror in the entryway. "Did you scratch this?"

"No," I huffed, crossing to stand next to him, looking where he was rubbing his finger along the bottom frame.

"This scratch wasn't here before," he insisted, and I pushed into his side.

"If you'll move your hand, maybe I can see what you're talking about," I answered, squinting to see what he was worrying. The old frame was riddled with cracks and scratches; what was he seeing? I tried leaning over his arm, but it was in my way, so I ducked underneath and raised up on my tippy toes. I brushed his hand aside and examined where his finger had just been.

The half-inch scratch looked as old as the wood. I started to tell Clark exactly where he could go scratch when I felt the warmth of his body against mine. Pressed along the length of me, the long, lean lines of his body fit against mine, and he slid his finger back into place. On the wall.

"See this? This wasn't there before," he breathed, just behind my ear. My neck bloomed with heat.

What was happening here?

I slowly dropped from my toes to my heels, pressing my spine further against him. Then I raised up once more, arching to lean closer to the wall, pushing another part of me more firmly against a specific part of him. He let out a hiss, and I grinned into the wall. "You mean this here?" I asked, dragging my thumb across the gouge in the wood.

I repeat. What was happening here?

I chanced a look over my shoulder and saw Clark. Eyes closed, jaw clenched. Inhaling deeply.

And further over my shoulder was Caroline. Arms crossed, with a knowing grin.

I turned back to the wall, tapped the scratch, and slipped out from under his arm. "I guess we'll just add it to the list of things to do," I announced.

His eyes popped open. Clearing his throat, he turned, then saw Caroline. "Oh, hello there. Good to see you again," he said, walking away and putting the entire room between us. "I trust this contractor you've hired is familiar with this kind of restoration work?"

I leaned against the wall, flustered and confused and not at all sure what had just happened. It was hot in here; I needed to open some windows. I pulled at the neck on my T-shirt, fanning myself, and Caroline smothered a laugh.

"Yes, he works with a local guy I've worked with before. They're very careful with projects like this," she answered.

Clark nodded briskly. "Good, very good. While we're waiting for him, let me show you some of the designs I came across in the archives of some of the original homes here in town. You mentioned you were going to be consulting on your friends' vacation home, and I'm familiar with that house. It's a beauty," he said, setting his briefcase on the dining room table, having a perfectly normal conversation with Caroline-while I was still trying to bring my heartbeat back to its normal rate.

He didn't seem to be affected in the slightest. Humph.

Most uncomfortable day ever. I mean it. Once the contractor arrived we went from room to room, with Caroline leading the charge. Thank goodness she was there, because the tension that was simmering between Clark and me was like a thin coating of insanity covering every word uttered. And every heated glance. And every not-so-heated glance.

When I asked if the cedar closet off the upstairs hallway could be removed to expand the bathroom? A lecture from Clark on why it would be a crime against humanity to destroy something as important as this very closet. I listened for the first two minutes, then got caught rolling my eyes and was promptly scolded. To which I stuck out my tongue. Which resulted in a gaze so smoldering from Clark it's a wonder the cedar didn't burst into flames.

And when Caroline and Contractor Joe needed to discuss recaulking the windows on the second floor, going on and on about how for the best seal you needed a really thick caulk? Clark turned three shades of purple and I damn near bit through my lower lip.

But as the day stretched on, progress was made. At the end we had a clear plan for making the changes I felt were needed but also made Clark comfortable. Not only in terms of the historical register but meeting his mental guidelines for the integrity of the house. Caroline had walked a tightrope between the two themes all day, mediating and balancing the tension that was no longer ignorable.

The easy truce Clark and I had formed after the first few days, the friendship that had blossomed while I was back in Philadelphia, was gone. And in its place? Uncomfortable silence. Frustrated and stilted conversation. And worse? Caulk. Oh the caulk.

Once we said good-bye to Contractor Joe, Caroline excused herself to make a phone call and I was alone with Clark in the entryway.

Silence. More silence. Shuffle of shoe, puff of breath, and then again, silence.

Finally, we both started:

"So what do you think about-"

"So if it's all right with you-"

Then we both backed off.

"Go ahead," I said.

"No no, what were you going to say?"

"No please. You first," I insisted.

"Ladies first, Vivian," he insisted right back.

This would go on all night if our mutual stubbornness had its way.

"What I was going to say is, what do you think about Joe? He seemed to be the best of the bunch to me."

"I think he appears to be very capable, and seems to understand what you're going for here. I'm sure he'll do a fine job."

"Good. I mean, I thought so too, but I wondered what you thought," I rambled, filling the space. Which had never been necessary before. "So-yeah."

More silence.

"What were you going to say?" I asked.

"Hmm?" He seemed distracted.

"When we both started talking at the same time? What were you going to say?" I repeated.

"Oh. Well, I was just going to say that it seems like Caroline and you have really worked things out, and this project is pretty well on track. I think everything's going to work out just fine with the house."

"I think so too. It'll be fun to see some of these things take shape." I moved a little closer to him and pointed to a cornice piece that separated the entryway and the living room. "I really liked your idea of trying to replicate these upstairs. It'll really tie things together."

"It seemed like a natural progression," he said softly, pushing up his glasses.

"And I'm glad you liked the ideas I had about the master bathroom. I was afraid you'd veto my rain shower," I teased.

He sighed. "Why would I veto your rain shower? Bathrooms need to be updated, Vivian. Even I know that." His voice had changed again. He seemed tired, frustrated. Aggravated, but not in the way I normally seemed to get under his skin.

I'd teased Clark in the past to get a reaction out of him, but right now there was nothing I wanted more than to hear him say "impossible woman" in that deep voice of his. But that's not what he said.

"I think it's time I stepped back and let you follow through on the choices you've made here."

He started for the door and I darted in front of him. "Hey. Wait, where are you running off to?"

"I'm not running off anywhere. I'm leaving," he said matter-of-factly, looking anywhere but at me when I wedged myself between him and the door.

"Oh come on, Caroline and I were going to have a glass of wine, sit and watch the ocean for a bit, then maybe take the Blue Bomber out for a run up the coast." Pressing back against the door, I smiled up at him in a winning way.

"You're going to drink wine and then drive a car?" he asked sternly.

"No! If we did go for a drive it'd be much later, like ... Dammit, Clark, you know what I meant!" I chewed on my thumbnail. "So come on. Stay. Okay?"

"I can't," he said, and moved to step around me.

I moved too. "Can't or won't?"

"Vivian." He groaned when I matched him, bobbing when he weaved. Getting in his face and staying there.

"Can't or won't?" I repeated, unflinching. I stared into his eyes, molten chocolate and full of an emotion that was impossible to pinpoint.

"I have plans."

"Plans?" I asked incredulously. Which was a bad idea.

"Yes, I have plans. Not all my evenings are taken up with thinking about you," he spat out. "About you and this house, I mean."

"Well, what are these plans?" I asked, frowning.

He opened his mouth, closed it, then opened it again. He licked his lower lip, and I stared at it.

Caroline's high heels clicking across the floor made me glance away, and he pushed past me onto the front porch.

"I'll see you later," he said, and was down the steps just as Caroline came up behind me. We watched the Taurus leave at a sensible speed, like the pace car in a homecoming parade. No dust thrown up from his tires, straight down the middle of the road.

"Did you ask him to stay?" she asked.

"Yeah," I answered, heading for the kitchen. "Drink?"

"Sure." She followed me.

I poured myself a Scotch and a glass of wine for her.

"Feel like heading into town tonight?" I asked, and she nodded, her eyes curious. "Good," I answered, throwing back my drink and not even wincing at the burn. "Good."

Two drinks later, Caroline, Jessica, and I were perched on bar stools at John's after walking into town, requiring pizza and more drinks. We'd acquired both and were now about to retire to a corner booth. While Caroline and Jessica had wisely switched over to water, I was steadily working through my fourth Scotch. And showing no signs of stopping. My body felt warm and loose, my lips were numb and buzzy at the same time, and I undid the top buttons on my shirt, needing to feel a little air.

"Stop undressing yourself," Caroline teased.

"Someone should," I mumbled, but I did stop just short of my bra.

"Oh, someone would. Believe me," Jessica snorted, and she and Caroline shared a knowing look.

"Stop being secretive. Say what you need to say. Say what you need to say."

"No John Mayer, karaoke is on Sunday nights." Jessica passed me a napkin to wipe up the Scotch I'd just spilled. "How are things with the cowboy?"

"The cowboy?"

"Yeah, you know, the center of your alleged romance novel?"

"Oh yeah. Him. Well-"

"Wait," Caroline interrupted. "You're writing a romance novel?"

"No, I'm not. And why don't you"-I pointed at Jessica-"just be quie-"

"Oh, you haven't heard Viv's theory? Of why she's out here?" Jessica giggled, and Caroline looked at me.

"What theory?"

"There's no theory. It was more of a feeling that-"

"I'm totally confused." Caroline looked to Jessica for guidance.

"That's okay, so is Viv."

"Viv is right here! And Viv is going to smack you if you don't stop all this romance novel talk right now!" I said.

Which shut her up for about three seconds.

"So Viv has this crazy idea that-"

"I'll tell her! You'll just mess it up," I snapped, and Jessica gestured as though the floor was now mine. "Okay, so here's the thing. I feel like Hank and I are meant to be together."

"Hank?" Caroline asked, frowning.

"Yes, Hank. Together with me. Like in the biblical sense."

"Like, the earth was flooded and he's the only man left?" she asked.

Jessica slipped her a quiet high five.

"No! Have you seen him? With the abs and the chest and the face?" I asked, spilling a little more of my drink as I told the story of his body with my hands.

"Sure, I've seen him. I've talked to him too. Well, he grunted at me." Caroline wrinkled her nose a bit.

"He grunted at you?" I asked, confused. "When?"

"That day we were all out here. He looked at my tits and grunted something like 'sweet' and then disappeared into the barn. I got the feeling I was supposed to swoon or something," she snorted.

"He does like them tall and blond," Jessica mused. "Although he usually likes them sluttier than you, no offense."

"None taken." They clinked glasses.

I drained mine and waved at John for another.

"So, you think Hank and you are supposed to be together," she said. "Why is that, exactly?"

"It would take too long to explain," I grumbled.

"Viv reads a ton of romance novels. So when she got a call in the middle of the night to move across the country, and take over a house on a cliff she'd inherited from an aunt she barely knew, and there was a half-naked cowboy involved, she assumed she was now living in one of the books she loves," Jessica recapped, and looked to me for approval.

I sighed. "And once again, when you say it like that, it sounds ridiculous. But it's not just that-it's other stuff. Like, aren't you supposed to struggle a little? Isn't part of a great romance the chase? The push and pull, the hunt, the uncovering bits and pieces of the great penis puzzle?"

"Um. What?" Caroline asked, and I dropped my head to the table.

"Didn't you and Simon take forever to get together?" I asked from underneath my arms.

"Yes. But it was all foreplay. It was going to happen; it was just a question of when," she said, her voice going all dreamy. I looked up at her, and her face was dreamy too.

"Well, that's how it is with me and Hank," I insisted, frowning even as I said it.

"But there's another piece of this penis puzzle, right?" Jessica said.

Caroline nodded emphatically. "Totally. I think you're missing something here, Viv. You're missing the biggest piece of all."

I sat up straight, stretching my back and looking toward the bar, wondering where my drink was. I didn't see John. But I did see ...

"Clark," I whispered.

"Exactly!" Caroline and Jessica said at the same time.

I shook my head, not taking my eyes off him. "No, I mean at the table by the bar."

Their heads swiveled, and we all watched as he pulled out a chair. For a girl.

Tall. Thin. Blond. Gorgeous. Smart, I assumed. She had that look. She must be the plans he had for the night.

Clark laughed at something she said, and I winced as that dark chuckle made its way over the din of a hundred conversations, a hundred glasses tinkling and forks forking. She unfolded her napkin, placed it squarely and daintily in the middle of her lap, and then placed her hand squarely and daintily in the middle of the table. And brushed the side of his hand. Brushed the side of his hand! Slut!

I was out of my chair and across the bar, dodging Caroline's grab and ignoring Jessica shouting my name. Clark turned just in time to see me barreling toward him, and he jumped up from his chair.

"Well hello!" I sang out, planting myself in front of the table, squarely and decidedly undaintily. "Sit down, Clark, don't let me interrupt," I chided, putting my hand on his shoulder and firmly pushing him back down. "Just wanted to come over and say hello. Hello!" I turned my attention to the cool blonde in front of me, who looked at me with amusement. Wrong emotion. "I'm Viv, nice to meet you," I said sweetly, offering my hand to her.

"Nice to meet you, Viv. Wait-as in Vivian?" she asked, and I looked from her to Clark. He blanched.

"As in Viv, yeah."

"Oh my goodness, why don't you join us?" She clapped her hands in delight.

"Oh no, I'm sure Vivian has better things to do tonight than to-"

"I'd love to!" I cried, grabbing a chair from an empty table and straddling it backward. "What are we drinking?"

"I don't think that's a great idea-" Clark started, and I gave him a pffft.

"Nonsense, it's a fine idea. How else can-sorry, what was your name?" I asked the blonde.

"Chloe." She looked from me to Clark.

"Chloe! What a lovely name. Let's all have a drink together, shall we? Hey, John!" I shouted, and he yelled back. "Bring my drink here, okay?"

"You got it!" he called back, and I settled in, crossing my arms over the back of the chair. I grinned at Clark, who mimicked my grin tightly.

"Vivian, I was hoping we might run into you tonight. I've been dying to meet you," Chloe said.

"Chlo," Clark said with a groan, and I winced at the familiarity.

Why would I wince? Matter of fact, why the hell was I over here? I looked back toward my own table, and saw Caroline and Jessica waving frantically, trying to get me back to our table. But I was committed now.

"You were hoping to run into me?" I asked, looking at Clark. Who was staring at my chest. I looked down, noticing the top of my black bra was peeking out from behind the buttons I'd undone earlier. Not taking my eyes from his, I flicked one more open. He groaned again, in a very different way. In front of Chloe? What the hell were these two into?

She just laughed. "Vivian this and Vivian that, can you believe she said this, and can you believe she wants to do that-what a piece of work he made you out to be!"

I looked at her in confusion.

"I haven't heard my cousin talk about someone like this in the longest time, but now that I've met you, I can understand why!" She made a face at Clark when he threw eyeball daggers at her.

"Whoa whoa whoa. Clark's your cousin?" I turned to him and threw a few eye daggers myself. "Your plans were with your cousin? What the f**k?"

"Watch your language, Vivian," he warned, throwing back his own Scotch as quickly as John put the drinks on the table. He stared at me over the rim of the glass, eyes smoky hot and angry.

I leaned on the table, two legs of the chair now in the air. I looked him right in the eye, and lowered my voice. "What. The. Fuck. Clark."

"Chloe, would you excuse us for a moment?" he asked, not taking his eyes off of me.

"Sure thing," she said with a chuckle. "Nice to meet you, Viv," she offered, patting me on my shoulder as she left the table. I didn't actually see her go, since I was engaged in a stare-off with a librarian.

"She's nice," I said.

"You're drunk."

"That's correct," I agreed.

"I'm curious about something, Vivian," he said, still not breaking eye contact with me.

"Curious?"

"Mm-hmm. About why you were so interested in who I was here with tonight." He leaned forward; I leaned forward even more. We were within inches of each other. "You almost looked ..." He looked at my hair, my lips, my shoulders, my br**sts, still pushed forward and half bared. When he met my eyes again, he lifted one corner of his mouth. "Jealous."

"Jealous? Me?" I breathed, then turned it into a laugh. Which turned into a sputter. "I just came over here to say hi. To my friend, who I used to talk to all the time. My friend who used to want to help me with my house, and call me in the middle of the night, and go for rides in a kick-ass car with a ridiculous knight in shining armor hanging out of the back. Where did he go?"

"You really have no idea, do you?" He shook his head, then stood up, calling out to John, "We're gonna take that pizza to go."

"You're leaving? Again? Why do you keep doing that?" I asked, angry. My head was starting to hurt.

"Chloe's going through some stuff right now, and-"

"How could anyone that pretty be going through some stuff?" I snorted, looking over his shoulder at the gorgeous blonde at the bar.

"Everyone goes through stuff, Vivian. She's thinking about leaving San Diego and moving up north. She needed to talk it out. Sometimes you just need to say things out loud to really hear it."

"I can say some things out loud," I muttered, staring up at him. So tall. So angry. When had he gotten so angry?

He nodded to someone behind me, and I turned to see my girls flanking me.

"Make sure she gets home okay?" he said quietly to Jessica, and she nodded.

Which made me angry.

"I don't need someone to make sure I get home okay. I can take care of myself, you know," I snapped.

He just looked at me flatly.

I didn't like that. If anything, I preferred the angry Clark.

He turned away, chatted with John for a minute, and took his pizza. Then he gathered his cousin from the other end of the bar, where she waved a good-bye.

He was gone. I was drunk. With half my bra out.

I was ready to go home.

I woke up with a ball of awful in my mouth, which turned out to be my tongue. With each step toward the bathroom, I was reminded of how very bright the sunshine was here, how very loud seagulls could be, and how very briny the ocean smelled when it was right outside your window. The window letting in all that damned light.

As I weaved down the hallway, Caroline appeared in her doorway, fresh and pretty, the f**ker.

"Morning, sunshine," she said, and I punched her in the shoulder. Not hard. "Nice," she said.

I nodded back and made for the sink. With a mouthful of toothpaste I splashed water over my face and evaluated. And then evacuated the contents of my stomach into the toilet. Caroline thoughtfully closed the door as I sat on the floor, waving her away.

"I'm going to get you some saltines," she called, and I moaned a thank-you. I let my body get its bearings for a moment, then splashed some water on my face a second time. Also tried the toothbrush a second time. Feeling a little better, I grabbed my robe off the back of the door and made my way downstairs.

In the kitchen, Caroline was tearing apart my pantry. "No saltines, but I found some oyster crackers."

I smiled weakly. "I'll take 'em. And if you could just hit me over the head with a sledgehammer, that'd be great."

"No sledgehammer handy; how about a screwdriver?" She followed me to the table, setting down the crackers and some water.

"As long as it's the tool, not the cocktail. Anything will feel better than the hell I'm currently in." I sipped the water gratefully and munched on a few crackers. "Did I really unbutton my shirt in front of half the town last night?"

"You did. The table next to us was taking bets on whether you'd take your bra off, Flashdance style." She moved around the kitchen in a blur, pouring coffee, flipping burners.

"How'd you figure out how to do that so fast? It took me weeks to get that damn stove to work," I said. "Not to mention the percolator."

"I installed one of these stoves for a client and was fascinated by it. I thought about putting one in our new kitchen, but my love for a Viking won out."

"Vikings are hot," I agreed, and sipped some more water.

"Speaking of hot, you want to talk about last night?"

"Nope," I told my crackers.

"Not at all? You don't want to talk about how you ran over to see who Clark was having dinner with?"

"Nope."

"While in the middle of telling us a story about how you're destined for some cowboy?"

"Nope."

"Okay." She walked over with her coffee and toast and sat across from me. Saying nothing.

"It was his cousin," I said, taking a piece of her toast. "In case you were wondering."

"I had a feeling it was something like that," she said, barely hiding her grin.

I'd have rolled my eyes, but they felt like they'd been dipped in sand. But mentally? Epic eye roll.

Caroline stayed until after lunch, walking me through some final thoughts she had for the house. I showed her the attic, and told her my idea for turning it into a studio. Not having any idea I'd been an artist in my other life, she was thrilled with the idea and made me promise to show her some work next time she was in town. "Better yet, send me some pictures when you get things up and running again." I tried to explain to her that it had been years since I'd actually painted, and that who knows what would happen when I actually got up there and started playing around, but blah-blah-blah, she wouldn't hear it.

Simon was flying in tonight from Mexico, and she was anxious to get back before he did. I envied her. I admit it. She had a man who adored her and no doubt ravaged her to within an inch of her life. She had that glow, so it was safe to assume. More important, she had someone who said I love you. Woke up to it, walked in the park with it, sat on the couch next to it, and heard it during the sexy times. Big, sappy sigh.

Holding my arm in a sisterly way as we walked out to her car, she took a deep breath of ocean air before throwing her bag into the backseat. "It really is kind of magical up here. Simon and I need to start heading north more often."

"My door is always open, come on up whenever."

She pulled me in for a close hug. "Be careful, okay?"

"Okay. You be careful too?" I said, confused.

"Seriously, Viv. I know you think you're in this romance novel-"

I moaned and pushed her toward the car.

"No really-listen. I believe in signs, and that things are meant to be, I truly do. But try and be open to anything, okay? It doesn't always have to be so hard. Sometimes falling in love just means turning around and seeing what's right in front of you."

"You should be writing for Hallmark."

"Fuck you, Viv-this shit is gold I'm giving you. Gold."

"This is what I get for sharing secrets," I muttered, shaking my head.

"Just remember what I said, okay?"

"Be open. Got it. Drive safe." I laughed, giving her a little salute as she got into the car. "And thanks for everything, all joking aside. I really appreciate it."

"You're not going to kiss me, are you?" she asked, deadpan.

"Thinking about it," I shot back.

She laughed, backed out of the driveway, and honked cheerily as she headed around the corner. Then she was gone.

And I was alone. With Caroline's words echoing in my hangover head.

It doesn't always have to be so hard. Sometimes falling in love just means turning around and seeing what's right in front of you.

If this were a made-for-TV movie, I'd walk toward the edge of the cliff and watch the breakers roll in, casting a strong but sad silhouette against the backdrop of steely blue. The camera would pull back slowly, taking in the beautiful but empty house.

I went into the kitchen to make a peanut butter sandwich.

But those words worked on me all day. And damn if they didn't work my belly into a mess of knots.

Chapter fifteen

I paced. I plotted. I plotzed.

I padded in circles around the house, adjusting Post-its on the wall where Caroline had left notes for the contractor, making sure they were at ninety-degree angles and flush with the others in their row.

After Caroline left, I couldn't stop thinking about her parting words. Damn her and her witchy ways.

I stared down the dolls in the dining room that Jessica still hadn't taken home, and fired off a text that said that if she didn't come and get the psychotic army they would be marched lemminglike toward the cliffs. She responded with a very specific finger gesture.

I organized the Johnny Mathis albums, which had been relocated from the fireplace to the built-ins on either side. I arranged them by style (Christmas and otherwise) and then by date, making them easily accessible whether you were searching by time line or by season. Alphabetical when possible. Did I Dewey decimal myself in order to keep my brain occupied? Perhaps. But Dewey brought to mind a very particular person who was determined to cross-reference himself right out of the stacks, smack dab into the romance section.

There was a sudden crack of thunder, and when I looked out the picture window I saw lightning stab the sea. Great. The rain that had been promised all week was finally rolling in. The wind was picking up, assaulting the hanging baskets of ferns on the back porch.

I curled my knees underneath me on the couch, wrapping my arms around my shoulders and huddling inward. I'd changed into my pajamas when I realized I wanted nothing more than a good sulk tonight. But the white V-neck T-shirt and cotton panties weren't keeping me very warm. Luckily I knew where to find a giant pair of tube socks, and I'd pulled them up past my knees, tugging them up even farther now to fend off the chill.

My eyes roamed the room and stopped on the fireplace. Hey, Contractor Joe told me the chimney was sound and safe to use. Hey, there's a bunch of wood there that looks dry and brittle. Hey, Viv, make a fire.

So I did.

I grew up camping, so I can make a fire with three sticks and a string. I opened the flue, crumpled up some newspapers, and shoved them underneath the old iron grate, which could hold a fire large enough to roast a beast. I stacked kindling, breaking off some of the smaller bits of bark to make a little fire nest, making sure there was enough room for the air to get through.

That's what novice fire builders forget about. For the fire to burn long and bright and stay hot, you need a little space. A little room to breathe. But not too much space, or the fire will go out.

Shaking my head as deep thoughts began to poke through again, I struck a match and lit the paper below the grate. The kindling above began to catch, crackling and popping. Laying two larger logs on top, and continuing to feed twigs and snapped-off pieces below, within minutes I had a large blaze going, sending out its warmth and beginning to take the chill off the room. Keeping the area clear in front of the fire, I set the screen to the side so I could enjoy the view.

I curled back onto the couch, watching as the fire grew, illuminating the approaching dusk with a radiant glow. Embers gleamed brightly underneath the blaze, ruby red and cheery orange.

But I wasn't cheery. My stomach was still in knots. No one else seemed to see the romance novel that I was still convinced I was starring in. Or they did, but they didn't think the cowboy was the hero. Was I still convinced?

Dammit. Double dammit.

Confusion whirled with anger and frustration. Resignation?

But when I saw Hank's truck speed around the corner of the house and stop next to the barn?

Pure, unadulterated lust took center stage.

I thought about nothing at all as I crashed through the house and out the back door, crossing the yard with a single intent.

Must. Have. Now.

He'd already stripped down, the shirt tossed casually aside as you do when you have hay to pitch, and the sight of his suntanned skin and muscles for days made me quicken my pace.

The chickens knew better than to get in my way; they cleared a path straight through to the barn as I walked so fast my boobs jiggled. They'll do that when you're a double D and you left your bra on the floor upstairs. See, it's all how it's supposed to be! Did I randomly forget my bra earlier that day, or did some unknown hand guide me, eliminating bra clasps for frantic fingers to fumble over?

Predestined. Preordained. There just better not be any premature what-have-you, 'cuz this shit was going down. And God willing, so was he.

I entered the barn, striking what I thought was a particularly fetching pose with one hand poised over my head, the other on my waist, leaning against the doorway, hips jutted forward, back arched, girls pitched forth like an offering.

He was pitching hay down from the loft. So strong, so virile, sweat already gleaming on his stunning hand-of-God-etched back, his hips narrowing into a waist I wanted to wrap my legs around and ride off into a sexual sunset.

Speaking of sunset, it cut through the impending clouds, golden and glowing across the barn floor, highlighting the scattering of hay, the rustic planks, the brown poop.

Um, what?

It's a barn. That's where the poop lives.

Well, I could breathe through my nose. And pretty soon I'd be panting, so no matter. I returned my gaze to Hank.

Yeah, concentrate on him. His hands sliding up and down the handle, gripping the shaft and turning into the upstroke. Aw yeah.

I waited for him to turn around and see me, to see me and leap down from the hayloft, his eyes burning hot and wild, his blood racing throughout his body and concentrating into one big, thick, hard, throbbing missile of seed.

Quiet. He's going to turn any minute.

But he didn't. So I did what any heroine would do in that situation.

"Ahem."

Nothing.

"Ahem."

Paul and Paula turned. Hank? He kept on pitching hay.

With words designed to seduce, incinerate, and level, I ordered, "Turn around, please." Aw yeah.

He did turn. He did appraise. And how could he not? I was a vision in white, backlit perfectly by the setting sun for the ravishing of the century.

His eyes traveled down my body, and everywhere his gaze went, my flesh sizzled.

He tossed his pitchfork to the ground, and as he climbed down the ladder, each inch of skin revealed above his low-slung jeans was a present from the gods. He jumped the last three rungs, landing lightly on his feet with a predatory feline grace.

He looked at me from underneath impossibly long lashes, his tongue licking his lower lip. A flash of something crossed his face. Longing? Pure carnal need? Or did it border more on ... amusement?

Amusement was good; simple pleasures and all that. It hinted at a deeper emotion. After all, one cannot live on lust alone.

The onion was finally peeled, much like my clothing would soon be.

He rested his hands on top of the buckle. "C'mere," he said, his voice silky smooth and perfectly orchestrated to make me swoon.

Swoon I did, and I closed the distance between me and my destiny. I left behind my perfect lighting, but the closer I got to my perfect cowboy, I couldn't tell if the sun rose in the east or the west. I was now within inches of miles of beefcake, and I wanted to sink my teeth into every layer.

He reached out one hand, fingertips seeking and finding my mouth, which instantly parted. He pressed his thumb against my lips, tasting of salt and earth and man. He pressed further, and I took him in. He was inside of me, finally. I suckled at his thumb, and his eyes darkened.

"All right. That's what I'm talking about," he said.

Huh?

"You want me, don't you?" he asked, and I nodded. "Say it. Out loud."

Did he just quote Twilight? No matter.

"Ah wah ooo," I managed. Not as sexy when you're sucking someone's thumb. But that's okay. This was happening.

And now he was pushing me up into one of the stalls. My back thrust up against a hay bale. Still, with the thumb. Aw yeah.

As I bounced off the hay, my entire field of vision was filled with Hank, and it was good. He removed his thumb, dragging his hand down the center of my body to wrap around my waist. Then he leveraged my lower body up and around him, my legs finally where they belonged. Ahhhhh. There is something about being wrapped around hot man that feels exactly right.

His eyes stared into mine, piercing my soul and seeing my innermost thoughts and secret desires. He seemed to be mapping my face, memorizing every feature, committing it to his memory to take with him to the end of his days.

"You look like that girl from the dancing movie. With the freaky black shit around her eyes."

"Um, you mean Black Swan?"

"Yeah, that one. Natasha Portland. Anyone ever tell you that?"

I am pretty sure no one had ever told me I looked liked Natasha Portland before.

I didn't want to talk anymore. I didn't want him speaking anymore. I used my feet to push against him, rocking his manliness against my secret flower, feeling this beautiful man. He got the message; a gleeful look coming over his face as he felt me, wanting and needy below his giant man hands.

His left hand rose to my cheek, sweeping my hair off my face. Burying his hand in my hair, he grasped me firmly by the nape of the neck, angling me to deliver the First Kiss.

He leaned in, the scent of sweat and sun and ... hay ... filling my nostrils.

I'd thought my tummy would be fluttering in "please hurry up and pound me silly" excitement. But I guess when something this epic happens, your body shuts down a bit, probably getting ready to redirect energy to the sexy parts.

Yeah, that must be why I'm not feeling anything here ...

He licked his lips.

Here it comes!

I licked mine.

The romance of the century, ladies and gentlemen!

And then he kissed me.

Correction.

Cowboy. Ate. My f**king face.

His mouth opened wide enough to swallow me whole. His tongue slapped and slobbered. His lips, wet and mushy. His breath? Stale beer and horror show.

My eyes? Wiiiiiiide open. Like my legs, which quickly began to shut.

Pressing against his chest, so sweat-slicked that I couldn't gain traction, I finally pulled his mouth from my neck, where it had begun to suck.

His eyes were filled with lust, and now confusion. "Where'd you go, baby?" he asked, licking my cheek. Like a motherfucking cat. Shudder.

"Slow your roll there, cowboy," I said, climbing down and tugging my T-shirt over my bottom.

"What the f**k, dude?"

"Bad idea. Bad, bad, bad idea."

I sighed, feeling the weight of everything I had pinned on this crashing down on me. What a f**king idiot I was.

"Cocksucker," I swore.

"Sounds good to me," Hank said.

I stared him down. Rising to my full height of five feet, two inches, I asked, "Why now? I've been throwing myself at you for weeks." Shit, the things I'd done to get this guy to notice me.

He ran his hands down his chest, then adjusted his dick. "Your tits look great in that shirt. I figured, eh. What the hell."

And there it was.

Hank was not a pirate, not a rogue prince, not even a cowboy. He was not the hero, nor was he the villain.

There were no layers to peel here. He was just a phenomenally good-looking guy who would always be attractive, even when he got a bit of a gut and that gorgeous hair started to thin. And there was nothing in the world wrong with being a hot, dumb guy. He just wasn't ever going to get to see how fantastic my tits really were.

So he should stick to his big, dumb, blond girls. Tiny tattooed brunettes were too much for him.

I left him confused and alone in the barn, and headed back toward the house. The dark clouds had gathered, and my mood now mirrored the weather. As I crossed the yard the wind blew my shirt up over my torso, and I didn't even care. I made it to the back porch just as the first fat drops of rain started falling.

I climbed the stairs, each step feeling heavier and heavier. Was it possible to have sad feet? They felt sloppy and slow, drudgy and draggy. I let the door bang shut behind me and went to the kitchen sink to rinse the spittle from my face. And neck. How had I played this so very wrong?

I heard the first sprinkle of raindrops on the roof, and by the time I made it into the living room, the windows were a sheet of rain. I flipped on the light but the bulb just buzzed and flickered out.

I focused on the fireplace, on the wonderful heat emanating from the blaze, my toes curling toward the flames. They were temporarily happy, but the rest of my whole body was sad.

It was so fired up for this manic coupling to go down, in perfect symmetry with the landscape, that now I internalized the rain, the damp, the chill. I looked left and saw the turntable I'd brought down from the attic. I looked right and saw Mathis, waiting for me. Why not embrace my inner sad sack: put on some old music, pour myself a Scotch, and let myself go full-on crash. But just one Scotch-no repeat of last night.

Shit, if I wanted to go full-on crash I could really think about last night. Was I ready for that?

I shuffled to the records and made my selection. The grand passionate romance that had bloomed in my imagination for months was imaginary. I was three thousand miles away from my family, who loved and cared for me whatever I did and whatever mistakes I'd made. And here I was, perched on the edge of a cliff in the rain. Alone. And all the adrenaline that had built up, making ready to celebrate with the cowboy, had crashed into bone-crushing loneliness. What had Clark said? Everyone gets lonely sometimes?

I winced. Shit, I wasn't ready to think about Clark yet.

I slid the vinyl from its sleeve, set it on the turntable, and dropped the needle.

As soon as I heard the first notes of the piano, I realized that Aunt Maude was right. You kept Johnny Mathis close by at all times. I walked over to the liquor cabinet, poured a highball rather high, and went to stand before the fire. Humming the familiar tune of "Chances Are," I clutched my Scotch to my chest and laid my head on the mantel, feeling the cool marble kiss my skin.

I was pathetic.

I was pitiful.

I was ...

Footsteps

... no longer alone?

The footsteps behind me were slow and strong on the wooden floor. But I wasn't scared, because I knew exactly who it was.

The librarian.

Chapter sixteen

I took a deep breath and slowly turned. And I mean slowly. Because as I turned, something happened. Something magical and intense, and not at all what I was expecting.

The lighting that seconds ago was dreary became enchanting. The chill in the air went from damp to bracing. The firelight turned to dancing flames of gold and bronze, painting sensual shadows across the walls. The music was no longer sad, it was timeless, full and swelling as it spoke of love and tenderness. And the rain was cozy and romantic, a perfect backdrop for the breathtaking image before me.

Clark. Brown chinos. White button-down. Tweed jacket. Elbow patches. Dusty glasses.

He was beautiful.

I was floored.

It doesn't always have to be so hard. Sometimes falling in love just means turning around and seeing what's right in front of you.

My breath left my body in a great whoosh as my eyes opened wide and took in what was now, and had been the entire time, standing right in front of me. My heart skipped a beat, then raced to catch up with the rest of my body, which was suddenly reaching out for this man, this man alone.

I'd been in a romance novel this entire time, but I had the wrong book. This was my book. This was my story. This was my man. Who wants a Superman when you can have a Clark?

And I wanted a Clark.

I wanted this Clark. It's amazing how much you can learn by just turning around.

"I came by because of the rain. I wanted to make sure the tarp had stayed down in these high winds. I knocked, but I guess you didn't hear me with the music on," he started, pushing his glasses up higher on his nose.

And in that moment, that exact moment, I fell 100 percent completely and totally in love with Clark Barrow.

Cue tummy fluttering.

He wasn't meeting my eyes, though, and I needed him to see me. My body was vibrating with the need to tell him ... something. Anything.

"Thank you," I managed, and the way my voice shook caused him to finally look up. "For checking on me."

We stood across from each other, the tension in the air palpable.

He took me in, his gaze traveling over my body, frowning slightly. Then his eyes narrowed.

"What in the world are you wearing, Vivian?" he asked, his voice low and gravelly.

I looked down, pigeon-toed in my tube socks and white T-shirt. "Jammies," I answered primly.

He let out a groan.

I'd heard that groan before. Nighttime Clark.

Emboldened, I shifted my weight to one hip. The effect on him was instant.

"Are you aware that, standing in front of the fire like you are, I can see everything you're wearing underneath?" His eyes flashed back up to mine. "Or what you're not wearing?"

I blushed, my hand fluttering to my collarbone, remembering that I was without a bra. I cocked my head to the side and looked at him from underneath my lashes. "I'm aware. I am so aware."

He took a step toward me, hesitating. So I took a step, without pause. Then another, and then one more.

Standing in front of him, I reached up almost on tiptoe because he was so very tall, and brushed back a lock of hair that had fallen across his forehead. "Clark," I whispered, and he closed his eyes. But not before the sweetest smile I'd ever seen crossed his face.

"Vivian," he breathed, leaning into my touch. His hands slowly came up to my face. His eyes still closed, his strong hands approached my skin, every nerve in my body reaching out to wherever his touch would land first. His hands were so big they touched everything at once. Cradling my face, he closed the distance, breathing me in. And he looked down at me with the deepest and warmest dark chocolate eyes I'd ever seen, swirling with molten caramel and flashes of firelight.

Now he would carry me up to my bed, lay me down across the quilt, take me into his arms, and make love to me on a cloud of angel songs.

But then his expression changed. He looked slightly confused; one hand moved into my hair, pushing through the curls toward the back of my head, and bringing forth ... a piece of hay.

He looked at it curiously, and then his gaze was drawn suddenly to the picture window behind me. And I heard the rumbling of Hank's truck roaring out of the driveway.

I saw Clark put the pieces together and come up with a roll in the hay. And the fury and agony in his face brought tears to my eyes.

He backed away from me, his face shuttered and his body absolutely rigid. "So stupid," he muttered, and the look on his face crushed me.

"No, Clark-it's not what you think. Nothing-"

"Save it, Viv. I don't need this one spelled out for me," he spat.

I gasped, my hand flying to my mouth at the sound of my name. "No," I whispered, horrified.

"You've got that right." He spun so quickly I barely saw him go. I heard his angry, hollow footsteps as he hurried through the house and out the back door.

I crumpled onto the antique rug. All I could feel was emptiness, a hollow at the pit of my stomach that I'd hurt Clark so deeply. It didn't matter that nothing happened with Hank. That he thought it had, that my actions could cause such pain to such a dear, sweet, wonderful man, was sickening.

Tears ran down my face, which his beautiful hands had just held.

The hands that I was lucky to have felt. The hands that any woman would be proud to hold, to feel, to writhe beneath, and to clasp tightly. And I wanted those hands.

What would a heroine do in this situation? Cry and wail and scream?

Maybe. But not crumpled into a ball on the floor. She'd do it while going toe-to-toe with her hero, making him hear, and making him see.

Fighting for her man.

I was on my feet in a flash, flying through the house, grabbing blindly for the back door and stumbling out into the rain. I made it down three steps before I saw him.

Standing by his car. Not getting in. Just standing.

In the rain, the thunder and the lightning, the tumult and the wind. Up to his loafers in the mud. Not getting in.

Holding his keys in a tightly clenched fist. One hand on the top of the car. Letting the rain pour down on him. Soaked. Angry. Not getting in.

"Clark!" I yelled. He turned. I ran across the yard. Soaked. Angry.

"Go back inside," he warned, his voice raised over the raucous rain.

"No," I said, and his fist shot out to pound on the roof of his car. "Not until you hear what I have to say."

"Go. Back. Inside," he said again, taking one step forward. He tore his glasses from his face, shoving them into his jacket pocket. His eyes were dangerous. His hair was plastered against his face, his tweed and his white button-down rain soaked. Absolutely magnificent.

I took a step forward myself. "Make me."

I could see the anger boiling off his skin. We both stepped forward at the same time. He opened his mouth, and my hand shot out to cover it before he could tell me to go back inside again.

I knew I only had seconds before he shut me down once more and actually left. So I took a deep breath, and spoke from my heart.

"I f**king love you, you goddamned librarian."

His eyes narrowed, so I went on.

"And it's not just because you're incredibly sweet and kind, or incredibly gorgeous and stunning, or incredibly smart and well read, or incredibly sexy and hot as all f**k, or incredibly impatient and smart-alecky, or incredibly strong and tan, or incredibly thoughtful and chivalrous, or have an incredibly substantial penis. Which I'm banking on, because I've seen you in running shorts, and holy shit, Clark."

His eyes widened, so I went on.

"I love you because you are all those things, but most important, because you're Clark. You're him-the one I've been dreaming about and lusting after, and wishing and waiting for. So you can leave here tonight if you want to, but I'll be outside your house tomorrow morning with scones, Clark-and I will be there every morning until you see me again. Until I can be your Vivian once more," I said, my hand still over his mouth.

"Or you can stay here, tonight and every night, and let me love you." I leaned in. "And for the record, I am so turned on by your elbow patches, I'm coming out of my skin over here."

His eyes darkened. Deepened. Still dangerous, but no longer cold.

Then I felt his lips open against my palm, soft and warm, and kiss my skin.

And then I felt his hand close over mine, sliding down my arm to wrap it around his neck, and he wrapped the other one tightly behind my back, clutching me close to him.

And then he told me, "I won't take less than every night."

He crushed me to him as he ran with me across the yard, up the steps, and into the house. And then I was pinned against the wall by one very wet, very intense, very hard librarian.

He caged me in, hands on either side of my head, my back arching to keep contact with him as he looked down at me. "Am I to understand from your confession out there that you've been dreaming about me?" he asked, his wet hair tickling me as he ran his nose down my neck, pausing at the hollow at the base.

He pressed a wet lingering kiss there, nuzzling at my skin. I moaned, the feeling of him divine, and he chuckled. "That wasn't quite the answer I was looking for." He nuzzled at me again, now drifting just below my ear, nibbling at the sensitive spot. "Were you dreaming of this?"

"Yes," I managed, twisting to keep his mouth on me.

"And this?" he asked, thrusting himself against me, letting me feel all of him. Exactly where I needed him.

"Yes. God, yes," I groaned.

And then my librarian kissed me. Those sweet lips met mine, crashing in and invading my brain with his lips and his tongue. I parted mine instantly, groaning at the feel of his mouth on mine. We kissed crazily, exploring and teasing, swirling and moaning as he expertly licked at my lips, sweet and perfectly matched.

Meeting my eyes once more, he lifted one corner of his mouth. "Mmm, Vivian."

I sighed at the sound of my name, lifting my shoulders in delight. Which tightened the wet white T-shirt across my chest. You could see everything, and I grinned sheepishly at Clark, a whaddyagonnadoaboutit look on my face. He grinned too, but his was infinitely sexier.

"This is the most ridiculous outfit I've ever seen, Vivian," he said, in the most proper voice I'd heard all night.

I followed his glance. My socks had fallen down around my ankles, covered in mud. The wet T-shirt was stretched to the point of ridiculous, falling off my shoulder.

"Take it off," he commanded, and I jerked my head up at the change in tone. His eyes burned into mine. I raised an eyebrow. He inclined his head slightly. "Now."

Nighttime Clark had arrived. Aw yeah!

Shivering with need, I lifted it over my head, my eyes on his. When I'd pulled it clear, his eyes roamed. I leaned down, peeling off the socks, then stood as slowly as I could manage. His jaw was clenched, tight and tense, as lust took over his expression.

"You too," I chided, hands on my hips, unabashedly thrusting my br**sts toward him.

Not taking his eyes from mine, my librarian began to undress. Tweed, gone. Loafers, kicked off. I couldn't wait for the button-down to come off, so I unbuttoned him myself. Then I untucked it from his chinos, those perfect tan chinos, and leaned in to pull the shirt from where it was tucked in behind his back. In so doing, I brushed my naked br**sts against his chest, skin to skin, and we both groaned. Now scrambling frantically to remove his shirt, I tossed it to the side as his long fingers unbuckled his belt and unzipped the chinos. Down they went, and I got a wonderful surprise.

Clark didn't wear anything underneath those chinos. And I had guessed right. Substantial.

"Holy mackerel, Clark." I gasped, staring at the work of art on display in front of me. He chuckled, but let me stare. And I did.

Long and lean, his body was even more amazing than I remembered from the day I saw him running-because now? I had the full effect. Broad shoulders, strong chest, lightest dusting of dark hair tapering into a trail that led down to Substantial Town. I wanted to drop to my knees right there and visit it immediately, but Clark had other things on his mind.

"If you don't take those panties off right now, I'm going to do it for you," he said.

"By all means," I teased, and was instantly pulled across the wet floor, skidding into Clark. He spun me around like a top and slid my panties down my legs, leaving me naked and panting.

"Christ, you're perfect," he whispered, beginning to dance kisses down my spine, exactly like in my dream. My dream lover come to life, my dark knight, loving me with his mouth and his words as I arched backward. "Look at you-look at all this gorgeous," he whispered to my skin, leaving wet kisses on the tattoo of the oak tree on the back of my neck, whose roots spread across the tops of my shoulders. The interlocking circles in the small of my back. The symbol for pi on my left cheek. He groaned when he kissed that one, wet open-mouth kisses and teethy nibbles. Then his hands were slipping beneath my ribs and moving on up.

"Vivian," he breathed into my ear, and I turned in his arms. In my dreams I'd never seen his face, and I needed to see him. I didn't want to miss any part of this. His hands, so very smooth, covered my br**sts completely. He cupped their weight and I moaned. Fascinated, he leaned down, his tongue dragging from my collarbone to between my br**sts, where he rested his head. My hands went to his hair, holding him close sweetly as he breathed in the scent of my skin.

Nuzzling now, he swept the tiniest of kisses back and forth, his hair tickling my sensitive skin. His hands clutched at me greedily once more, and I felt my br**sts tighten, which he noticed. With a dark laugh, he studied the ring in my nipple, standing tall and aching for his mouth. "Stunning," he whispered, and then his lips closed over the peak. My back arched, the sensation of his wet mouth and strong tongue teasing and taunting me. Something twisted deep inside of me, a desire so strong I almost came right then from the feel of his mouth on my breast. Flicking the tiny ring with his tongue, he tugged at it lightly with his teeth, and I hissed.

He sucked me deep into his mouth, his arms wrapped around me tightly, not letting me move under his attentions. My body bowed, aching to get as close to him as possible, looking for any kind of friction I could find. Clark had a similar thought in mind because he stood, picking me up with one hand on my bottom and the other around my thigh, making me shudder with delight at the way we slid against each other. I assaulted his mouth with my own in a frenzy to have him inside of me, any way that I could.

His strength moved us through the house quickly, past the living room, up the stairs, then pausing on the landing-where he placed me on top of the widest part of the railing, nudging my legs apart with his hips and with a wicked glint in his eye. Then he knelt before me.

"There's been something I've been dying to do since the first time you argued with me, right here." He kissed up the inside of one thigh and then the other, licking and thrusting with his tongue, holding my legs open with his shoulders as he groaned at the sight of me, open for him, ready for him. "Oh, Christ, you're beautiful," he said in awe. I shook with need, his gaze alone doing naughty things to me, and he looked up. "Do you know where we are, Vivian?" he asked, his eyes almost black with need. My hand was buried in his hair, grabbing for support as my legs scrambled for purchase.

"On the baluhwhozit?" I managed, and his grin was enough to make me fall in love with him all over again.

"Balustrade," he corrected, sliding me even closer to him, his grip firm on my hips. "I'm going to f**k you on this balustrade, so hard you'll feel it in your bones." He slowly breathed me in, nudging me with his nose. Sweet heaven, my librarian was a dirty talker. "But first? I'm going to indulge in a dream of my own." One finger slid down from my hip, circling closer and closer, winding me up, driving me crazy.

"You see, Vivian, when I called you? Late at night? It was because I wanted to talk to you, get to know you, learn more about you. What you might like, what you might love," he continued, now teasing lightly at my clit with his fingertip. I cried out, slapping at the railing, trusting Clark to keep me where he needed me to be. "And all that time, what I was actually dreaming about?" he said, looking up at me with those eyes full of lust. "Was the taste of you. All over my tongue."

I died. I cried. And then I died again as he buried his face between my legs and f**ked me with his tongue. He pulled my legs over his shoulders, wild and crazy and so strong. One hand held me open for him while the other clutched at my bottom, pushing me into his face, holding me tight. While I perched on his mother-loving balustrade. And when I came for him, knees clutched around his ears, hands buried in his silky brown hair, screaming his name, his eyes stared up at me with wicked running through them.

But I needed more. "Please Clark-please," I begged, my limp body still so very needy for him. I needed him inside.

"Condom?" he asked, his voice strained.

"Pill, we're good. Tested?"

"Clean."

"Me too." I stared down at him in wonder. Nothing would be between us-nothing at all. He kissed me, deep and slow and searching, the taste of me all over him. I licked his lips, clutched his neck, needing him closer, closer, closer.

He stood, wrapped my legs around his waist, and slid into me with one powerful thrust. I thrilled at his groan as he entered my body, a low, deep, growly groan that I felt all through me. Holding him close, I watched his face as he buried himself deep inside me. Before, it had been all lust and decadent thrills. But now, with his face mere inches from mine, his eyes seeing me, really seeing me? It was magic.

I was rocked to the core, filled with an intensity of emotion I had never felt before. I was in love with the man who was inside me, something I'd never experienced before, and tears ran down my face for the second time that night. Overcome, I shook as I felt him filling up everything that was hollow.

"You're divine, Vivian," he whispered, kissing my tears and resting his forehead against mine. "You're simply divine."

Old-fashioned words? Perhaps, but I'd nabbed me an old-fashioned guy. And how brilliant was that?

And my old-fashioned guy began to move, thrusting deeper into me, the weight of our combined bodies making the old wood creak. Sweet friction sizzled between us, spinning out of control as his pace increased and my hips moved in time with his.

"So good, Clark-it's so good." His mouth as he panted, his groans as he thrust into me again and again-I marveled at the beauty of this man, and at what this was becoming. It was beautiful. He rolled and circled his hips, pressing in exactly the right spot every time, and soon I was ready to slingshot around the moon once more.

"Christ, Vivian, I can feel you coming all around me," he murmured, and with those words, I was gone. And with a few more thrusts, he was gone too. He groaned into my neck as I held him close, and I felt him take a ragged breath.

Then he lifted his face to mine and tenderly kissed me. Touching the tip of my nose, he said, "I've loved you almost from the moment I saw you standing on the porch, threatening to tear it down. I've loved you since you put your leg up on the railing and teased me with your bare leg. I've loved you since you picked a fight with me about the very thing you're sitting on, and I loved you even when you punched me in the nose-mostly because you took off your shirt to stop the blood flow. Which was very quick thinking, I might add."

Which made me giggle. I loved Daytime Clark too.

"I love you," he whispered, and brushed his lips sweetly across mine.

"Vivian," I whispered back. "Say it with my name."

He smiled. "I love you, Vivian."

I smiled back. "I love you too, Clark. But can I ask you something?"

"You can ask me anything," he said, nuzzling at my neck.

"Did you lick my leg when you were under the porch?"

He froze, then burst out laughing. "I one hundred percent licked your leg when I was under the porch."

"I knew it!" I yelled, bringing his face back up to mine so I could kiss him again.

And then the balustrade finally gave way beneath us, and we fell to the floor of the landing in a tangle of naked limbs. I started laughing so hard I was bouncing. Which made his eyes focus on one area in particular, as he asked, "What the hell is so funny?"

"I told you I'd get a new baluhwhozit."

He laughed too.

Delighted, I pushed him down, my legs straddling his hips, and slid onto his still-hard Substantial Town. Putting his hands on my br**sts, I commanded, "Hold on here, Clark," and began to ride.

"Impossible woman," he said, but did indeed hold on.

For dear life.

I woke with a start, reaching automatically for Clark, but my bed was empty. Slipping into his white button-down, like all good heroines do the morning after, I padded downstairs. My nose pinpointed his whereabouts, the scent of coffee calling to me like a beacon. I peeked around the corner and saw him dropping French toast into a frying pan, whistling a tune that sounded a lot like "Chances Are."

Chances are no one ever looked as hot as my librarian did on this bright and shiny morning. Bare feet, unbuttoned chinos, and a smile. A smile that grew bigger when he saw me. "Get that sweet ass in here," he said, waving me over with his spatula. Aw yeah.

I crossed to him in three steps. Catching me in a fast embrace, he dipped me just like in the old movies, planting kisses all over my neck and collarbone, making me giggle and squeal. "Hungry?" he asked.

"Starved," I admitted, and he swung me back up onto my feet.

"Breakfast will be ready in five minutes; there's coffee already on the table," he instructed.

I grabbed two mugs and watched Clark flip his toast, whistling his tune merrily as he shook the pan, making the bread sizzle.

He made things sizzle all right, and I was so caught up in watching his fantastic butt that I overpoured and spilled the coffee. Hissing at the hot liquid on my hand, I set the pot down and went for the paper towels. Damn, we were out.

We.

Stifling a grin at the thought, I slipped into his loafers and made for the door. "Need to grab some paper towels from the backseat of the car; I forgot to bring those in yesterday," I told him, stepping out into the sunny yard. No traces of last night's storm were evident. I bore the traces of the Clark Storm, however, in the form of stubble burn on my neck. And between my br**sts. And between my thighs. Shivering at the memory, I started across the driveway to the Bel Air.

Clark pushed open the back door. "You don't have to grab those, Vivian, I'll get them." He crossed to me, taking the keys from my hand and opening the trunk.

"Hey there, Viv, need some help with- Whoa!" I heard from across the yard, as Hank appeared in the barn doorway. He looked at me, then looked at Clark. Then back at me again.

Clark calmly picked up the bag of paper towels and closed the trunk. "Morning, Hank," he said, tucking me into his side and grabbing my ass below his shirt. "I've got this." And he walked us back into the house, holding the door open for me, and grinning broadly.

Hank stayed in the barn, looking confused.

And I laughed as I straddled Clark moments later on the kitchen floor. Why ride a cowboy when you can ride a librarian?

Oh, the French toast? It was great ... reheated an hour later.

Epilogue

Six months later

The sun shone clear and strong through the new windows that had been installed. Heat curled around my bare toes as I stood in the middle of the attic, brush in hand, staring at my canvas. I chewed at my thumbnail, thinking about what direction to take.

"Vivian?" I heard from below, and my body immediately knew which direction to take. "You up here, Sweets?"

He called me Sweets. Smiling, I called down to where I knew he was waiting by the steps. "Come on up." He always waited until I gave him the okay; he didn't like to bother me while I was working.

I'd created a studio that was filled with light and color. We'd added heating and cooling so I could work up here year-round, and I'd purchased oodles of supplies. I'd kept some of the dressed mannequins; the colors they wore had become an inspiration for me and helped me get back into this world.

Caroline and Simon had come up to visit a few months ago, and when I showed her what I'd been working on she'd flipped. She purchased two paintings on the spot for clients, and asked me for ongoing updates on new pieces. It seemed I had a new career.

I'd carefully packed up all of the paintings by Aunt Maude and sent them to Mr. Montgomery, who was overwhelmed but very grateful. That was their story, and I was glad that the paintings had found a new home.

Over my head in my home was a new roof, and two floors down was a newly restored staircase with a new balustrade. The woodwork throughout the house gleamed once more, the floors shone, and the front porch was hole free.

And the Legless Knight still stood proudly in the corner of our bedroom, watching the sea for pirates.

Clark had moved in almost immediately. Was it too soon? I don't know, and I don't care. I loved him so utterly and totally that I wanted him around all the time. I asked him, he agreed, and just like that, we were living together. And we'd taken over the master bedroom. It seemed fitting, and we needed the space, frankly. He had more tweed jackets than I'd realized. Turns out that cedar closet was pretty useful.

I heard a whinny from out back, and I crossed to the window to look out at the barn. Nina, a veterinary student who had taken over caring for the animals, was exercising Paul and Paula in the pasture. Hank was long gone. We saw him around town occasionally, usually with a big-boobed blonde. Clark always held me a little tighter and his hands were a little handsier when we ran into him. I liked that. Was it wrong in this day and age to want to feel possessed by a man? Who cares; I liked it. He owned my ass 100 percent.

I heard my librarian's steps crossing the wide planked floors and he scooped his arms under my br**sts and kissed my neck. "I'm not bothering you, am I?" he murmured, his mouth nibbling at the curve of my shoulder. Goose bumps formed instantly, and I leaned back into him as his hands dipped lower and rested on my tummy. He was obsessed with the little bump there, which wasn't so little anymore.

Oh yeah. Clark was going to have a house full of kids, if he had his way. And he had his way with me frequently. The hormones I was experiencing made me crave his touch even more than before this wonderful surprise happened.

The day he found out he was going to be a father, he pulled a ring out of the top drawer in the dresser, fell to his knees, and asked me to marry him. Then he passed out cold from excitement. When he woke a few moments later, lying with his head in my lap, he told me that he was the luckiest person on the planet.

Second luckiest.

"Vivian," he said, my name always sounding so perfect when he said it. Only he got to call me that, and only he ever would.

"I'm hungry," I said, suddenly famished. "Let's get pizza and then go for a drive."

"Butcher Block?"

"Aw yeah," I answered, turning in his arms to clasp my hands behind his neck. "Then we can go park somewhere along the beach and make out like teenagers."

"Impossible woman," he whispered into my ear, pressing a kiss just beneath it and making me squeal.

"Come on, Clark, feed your impossible woman," I said with a laugh, and we headed downstairs.

And after the pizza, we didn't even wait to find a beach. We just put the convertible top up and f**ked just off the highway. That's how this romance novel ends. And when my librarian pushed deep inside me and whispered the naughtiest, filthiest things imaginable about what he wanted to do to me?

It really was my own happily-ever-after.
