The Beginning

TWO SIMPLE WORDS. One complex problem.

Henry Callahan.

He'd messed up my life big time a few years earlier. So much that nothing was left to mess up. Or so I'd thought.

Five years later, Henry Callahan was messing up my life once again. He might not realize it, but that was beside the point. Especially beside the point after I'd just gotten an earful from G for the past fifteen minutes. My eardrums were still ringing.

Since we knew another agency already had a girl on the Callahan Errand, G told me-well, she ordered me-to do whatever it took to get inside Callahan Industries or make sure the other girl got a one-way ticket outside. G said if I went with option B, she didn't care how I did it, so long as it worked. If I needed a more ... permanent solution, I was supposed to give her a call because G had a handful of hit-men on speed-dial. She'd used them before and she wouldn't hesitate to use them again, especially with an Errand this big. It was a bad case of the ends justify the means-something I wasn't exactly on board with when it came to a human life.

Luckily for me, option A was a mere phone call away.

I didn't bother calling his office line. If Henry's new assistant was as adept at her job as I was, she'd never put me through to him. She'd take a message, say he was in a meeting, out of town, or the line would mysteriously go dead. That's what I'd do and, as G and I knew, whatever phantom agency we were competing with, they'd assigned their best girl to the case, just as G had me.

A ten-figure Errand wasn't the time to send in the second string.

No, I wouldn't call Henry's office. Not when I had his private number.

I walked along the beach, straddling that jagged line where the damp sand meets the dry-one foot stayed on top, one foot sunk below. Punching in the number that I may or may not have memorized, I slid a few feet over into the wet sand.

It didn't ring twice before he answered. "Hello?"

A couple things struck me as odd. He'd answered without identifying himself-something like Henry Callahan speaking seemed more appropriate-and his voice was a couple notes high. Almost ... expectant.

"Hey ... Henry?" G would have shit a shotgun if she'd heard that gem of a greeting.

"Evie?" There was a clipped pause, and then, "Eve, is that you?"

My heart ached for the briefest moment when he called me Evie. I became that young and naive girl again, overwhelmingly in love with a boy I swore would turn the world upside down for me if I asked him to.

I mentioned I was naive back then, right?

"Yep, it's me. Eve ... that is." I paused on the beach because I obviously wasn't up to the task of walking and talking.

"You know, I was certain that when I gave you my business card, you'd toss it into the closest garbage can you could find. I didn't think you'd keep it, let alone call me." Henry's voice was back to normal. Calm and confident. Warm and solid.

I hated how so many of the things I'd loved about him were still the same. Things like his soothing, low-timbered voice, or the way he said my name-almost like it was a prayer and a sin all at once. He hadn't changed. But I had. I had to sell myself on those two assertions more than I should have to.

"You're right. I did throw your card away." It was true. I had. "But the closest garbage can happened to be the one inside of my condo, so it was easy to dig out."

Henry laughed softly. That exact laugh I'd loved. And now I hated. I had to remind myself of that last part because hating Henry Callahan's laugh was a difficult thing to do. Thrashing about in a small tank full of sharks without getting attacked would have been about as easy as hating his laugh.

"So what made you dig it out? Not that I really care, but I'm curious."

"Why don't you really care?" I asked.

"Because you called."

I sucked in a slow breath and decided to sit in the sand. If he kept saying things like that and I kept feeling things like I just had, I wouldn't be able to stand and talk either. I had to remind myself why I'd called him before I could speak. "The reason I called is because I was wondering if your offer still stood."

"Which offer?" he asked. "I don't really care because whatever offer I made you that you're referring to you can have, but it would probably be good for me to know which one you're talking about."

Henry had caught me off guard yet again. He made me other offers that morning on the beach? Which ones?

"The job slash contracting offer. Would you still be interested in having me on board?" Asking a favor from Henry was about as painful as I imagined pulling out an abscessed molar with pliers might have been.

"Of course it stands," he said. "Are you interested in coming on board?"

"Yeah, actually I am. That super secretive contracting gig might not be for me."

"And you think Callahan Industries might be the gig for you?"

I heard his amused smile in his tone. "I think there's only one way to find out." If he was going to play the conversation double-meaning game, I would too.

"What position did you have in mind? Development, program management, systems analysis?"

Might as well get started. I had no time to waste when it came to seducing my ex. "I don't know." I lowered my voice a note and slowed it down two notes. "What position do you want me in?"

He was silent for so long, I checked to make sure the call hadn't dropped.

"How about program management?" he suggested after clearing his throat. "One of my best PM's just got promoted, and I haven't filled the spot yet. You'd be overseeing a team of developers in Research and Development-keeping them on deadline, conducting team meetings, making sure they're properly fed and watered, that kind of thing."

"Fed and watered? Am I babysitting a litter of puppies or a team of employees?"

Henry's soft chuckle rolled through my body. "These are RandD developers. They're like a team of huskies-they'd run themselves to their deaths if someone didn't force them to take a break."

"And these are the kind of people you want me overseeing?" I watched the waves crashing into the shore and concentrated on the conversation, not the person I was having said conversation with.

"I can't think of anyone better, actually. There was a reason I gave you my business card and practically begged you to come work for me."

Yeah, there was a reason. But in the end, it wasn't about employment and program management. "Overseeing a team of pocket-protector wearing, Mountain Dew addicted RandD developers? Where do I sign up?"

"You'll take it?" Henry sounded as skeptical as I imagined he felt. Days ago, I'd been adamant about not working for him, and there I was, a step above begging to be brought on board.

"I'll take it."

Another long silence stretched between us.

"It may be none of my business, and you don't have to answer this if you don't want to, Eve"-great, this ought to be good-"but why do you want to work for Callahan Industries after ... everything that happened between us? Quite frankly, I would have guessed my company would be the one you'd want to destroy, not come to work for."

He was right. His company was the one I wanted to destroy. And he was wrong. His company was the one I was going to destroy. Along with the rest of his life.

"Your company was the last one I wanted to come work for. That was, until I started contracting at all the others and realized how many of the same chauvinistic dickheads I went to school with are now running those companies. You and I might have history-bad history-but I'm a firm believer in leaving the past behind and moving forward." Yeah, that might be one of the biggest lies I've ever told. "I'd rather work for a person I know is more concerned that an employee has a brain instead of a dick."

"Wait. You don't have a dick? Because that's a deal breaker right there. I only hire testosterone-ridden, top-of-the-food-chain, genetically superior men."

I rolled my eyes. "Liar. You wouldn't be at the top of the tech food chain if you actually believed that."

"No? Why's that?"

"Because you men work, and we women get the job done."

I joined Henry halfway through his laugh. Until I remembered how, once upon a time, I'd lived entire days and months of sharing laughs and moments like those with Henry Callahan. The pain of what had been generated a new kind of pain-the pain of what could never be again.

It was time to end that call. If something as simple as a phone call was so painful, how would I make it through all that was to come? I didn't have an answer, but I wouldn't rest until I found one.

"So when do you want me to start?"

"I'll skip the blase act because I'm desperate. Would tomorrow be too soon?"

A smile curved into place. "Tomorrow would be perfect." The sooner I got in there and figured out how to weed out Miss Competition, the sooner I could make sure it was my bed Henry would dive into.

"Excellent. I'll have my receptionist get the paperwork started, and you can finish the rest with her tomorrow morning."

Not so fast. "Paperwork? Come on, Henry, you want me to fill out an encyclopedia of paperwork? I was practically Mrs. Callahan for Christ's sake." My goal had been to dodge the paperwork-with-the-competition bullet, not bring up our prior almost-nuptials. I didn't know who was more thrown, me or him. Judging by the continued silence, we were pretty even.

"Even if you did become Mrs. Callahan, you would still be required to fill out paperwork if you wanted to sharpen pencils here. Company policy," Henry replied, but his voice was quiet. Removed.

I gave an exaggerated sigh. "Fine. But if I have to be single-handedly responsible for killing a tree, I'm not trudging through it with some over-smiley, sweater-set wearing receptionist. If you want me on board, you're suffering through it with me, Chief Executive Officer."

Was I bluffing? Sure. Most of my job entailed bluffing of some sort. If Henry said he didn't have the time, desire, or energy to walk me through mind-numbing stacks of paperwork, I wouldn't have walked away from the job. It meant too much to the outcome of the Errand. However, Henry didn't know that.

A second went by, then another.

"You drive a hard bargain, Eve, but I need you." He'll need more than my nine-to-five skills when I'm through with him. "We'll suffer through a murdered tree of paperwork together. I've got meetings in the morning, but how about you meet me for lunch and we'll get after it?"

All of the pieces were falling into position. A smile moved into place. "Okay. Let's get after it."

After agreeing on a time and a place, Henry said he had to hop onto a conference call. "Thanks, Eve. I'm thrilled to have you on board."

I couldn't manage a simple you're welcome because Henry's words bled with sincerity, and even though mine should, I knew they wouldn't. I should have felt more than welcome to do what I was going to do to Henry after everything he'd put me through. Every piece of me accepted that.

But my damn heart called bullshit.

HENRY HAD SUGGESTED a hole-in-the-wall Irish pub for lunch, which was surprising and yet not surprising. He was one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the country. Holding a business lunch at a place that specialized in bangers and mash and pints of beer didn't exactly equate. But he was still Henry Callahan, the unpretentious, liked-what-he-liked-and-not-because-it-was-popular man.

I made sure I wasn't the first to arrive. That was another insider trick we Eves had, and more women could benefit from learning, in my opinion. Men were hunters. They liked the chase almost as much as they loved the ... rewards of winning the chase. If a woman wanted to be chased, she sure didn't get there by showing up to a lunch or dinner date first. No, she got there late-late enough he started to wonder if she'd stood him up. Then, when he was squirming in his chair, she arrived with a small smile, a killer outfit, and the chase was on. If it wasn't on already. With Henry, I knew he was in some stage of the chase. I just had yet to determine if he was warming up or had already caught his stride.

When I meandered into the Irish pub that smelled as old as the outside looked, I realized I was way overdressed ... which meant I couldn't care less. I hadn't picked out my curve-hugging pencil skirt or sheer blouse to blend in. Nope, my objective was the opposite, and as I glided through that joint, every head that turned proved I'd nailed it.

Every head except for one. Of course it was the one I really needed to give me the once-over, all-over, times-two. But no, he was flipping through a stack of papers and seemed positively riveted. I cursed under my breath. Just when I thought I knew everything there was to know in Henry's file, he became totally oblivious to the one woman with heels and lipstick in the whole place. Actually, I might have been the only woman in the place, but the killer heels and lipstick should have been more attention-grabbing than a big zero. Only when I slid into my seat did Henry notice me.

"Eve, whoa, you kind of snuck up on me." He dropped the paperwork on the table. "Can I order you something to drink?"

"From how focused you were on that paperwork, I'm certain a herd of stampeding elephants could have snuck up on you just as easily." I raised an eyebrow at him. "I'll take a glass of wine. If they serve those here-glasses or wine."

I gave him a hint of a smile before glancing at his half empty beer. It was lunch hour on a work day, he was halfway into a beer, and he hadn't ordered lunch yet. I couldn't say with certainty, but I hoped that had something to do with him needing alcohol to help deal with his feelings for me. Of course, not knowing for sure pissed me off big time, because usually I could tell when I was close to luring a Target into my web. I'd never been so unsure on any Errand.

Of course the uncertainty would be thick when I had the biggest Errand of my career sitting a few feet away of me. Why the hell not?

Finally, Henry checked out my blouse. It wasn't so sheer he could read what size my bra was if the tag was showing, but it was sheer enough he could make out the subtle outline of my bra ... and it looked as though Henry was slowly doing that.

It might have been delayed, but the victory was mine nonetheless.

Clearing his throat, he pried his eyes away. "I was so focused on this stack of paperwork because it's the first time I've seen it." He lifted the first page of an application. "I'm not exactly up-and-up on the administrative tasks in my company."

I let myself smile. He wouldn't be getting "up-and-up" on his administrative assistant either because I'd just slipped past the front gates and was days away from usurping her throne.

"And this place does have wine and glasses"-he flicked his pint glass-"so which kind would you like?"

I leaned forward and looked at him. "You pick."

Yet another tool in our Eve belt: let the Target order a drink for me, especially if he still seemed on the fence about our anything-but-platonic relationship. Ordering for me made him think about me. It made him wonder if I was a hard alcohol, beer, or wine girl. Once he'd made it that far-and if Henry didn't arrive at the conclusion that I was a wine girl pretty easily, then I sucked at my job-then he had to consider if I liked white or red. From there, if I liked it sweeter or dryer ... if I liked a full-bodied red rolling around in my mouth or a smooth, sweet white when I swallowed ...

Everything can be turned into a game of sexual innuendoes by a woman who knows what she's doing. Anything. Something as every day as ordering a drink included.

As I let Henry contemplate what wine to order me, he motioned at the bartender, who looked to be the only employee in the place. Hopefully someone was back in the kitchen too. Otherwise we might be waiting a while for our food.

"What the hell is a girl this pretty doing with a guy this ugly?" the aging bartender asked in a thick Irish accent as he approached us.

Henry returned his smile. "That's classified information, Tom."

"Eh? About as classified as ..." Tom stopped at our table and glanced down at the stack of papers. The top sheet had the Callahan Industries name and logo, followed by the words Employment Application. "I don't know whether to applaud you or give you a swift shake for stooping to the terrible cliche of getting a beautiful woman beneath you."

Henry's eyes widened as Tom's did. Mine stayed the same ... I'd heard and done far worse.

"And by beneath you, I meant strictly in an employment capacity. Not the ... er ... the other way." Tom's face went a few shades red, then he shot me an apologetic look.

"And here I was thinking I was the only smooth operator out there. Good to know I've got company." Henry winked at Tom before lifting his hand in my direction. "Now that we're all feeling properly awkward ... Eve, what would you like to drink? I don't want to order you the wrong thing and have you turn down the job as my punishment."

I could have looked for a wine menu-if an Irish pub actually had one-or I could have asked Tom what they served, but that defeated the whole point, right? "I don't know what they have, and I promise I won't quit if you order the wrong thing. At least not this time." I gave him a sly smile. "Besides, you know what I like." I kept my eyes on Henry's as he worked out what to order. As he went through the red versus white, sweet versus dry, heavy versus light maze ... and then ...

"The lady will have a Guinness," Henry said confidently, which made me feel less confident.

I'd mentioned wine. I'd been giving the wine vibe. I'd been manipulating the situation so one thought would lead him to the next to the next to thinking about me beneath or on top or sideways in bed with him. I'd done it a hundred times. It wasn't my first rodeo.

... And Henry ordered me a Guinness.

Apparently, it was my first rodeo. Of course Henry would prove to be the one exception to every trick in my book. Why go and make my life easy?

"A beautiful woman who drinks Guinness at lunch." Tom covered his heart with his hands and glanced at my hand. My left hand. "And is single? There's still hope for me after all." Wagging his brows at Henry, he winked at me before going back to the bar.

"Yeah, and if I thought you had half a chance with her and were a tenth deserving of her, I might actually introduce you," Henry called after him.

"Charming guy. Good friend?" I guessed.

Henry raised a shoulder. "Good friend and business partner."

The not-quite-ancient "charming" man I'd just met couldn't even get his buttons in the right holes-as I'd just noticed. How he could be anyone's business partner-Henry's especially-had to be some kind of joke. I did a mental calendar check. Nope, it wasn't April first.

"Business partner? Your business partner?" My expression mirrored my doubtful tone. "Okay, what are you smoking and can I have some?"

Henry chuckled before taking a sip of his beer. He was drinking a Guinness too, which made me want one that much less. "I miss your sense of humor. The people I work with every day, you'd think they'd never heard of the concept. Certainly none have learned it, let alone mastered it like you have."

That's sweet, you've missed my sense of humor. Evidently not enough to stay out of another woman's bed and go on to marry a gem of a woman. "I'm still waiting for the explanation of that business partner thing you just mentioned."

Henry motioned at the room around us. "I decided to expand Callahan Industries into the service industry, and you're looking at the first and sole restaurant under the C.I. umbrella."

My mouth wanted to, but I didn't let it fall open. Henry had good business sense, and he could pay experts for their invaluable business sense. Had the entire department been on vacation the day that pub slipped under the C.I. "umbrella"?

"That's a joke, right?" That was the only reasonable explanation.

"No joke."

My forehead creased in confusion, which was not an attractive look. I couldn't afford unattractive looks-even one of them-when I was sitting across from the most difficult, high profile Errand of my career. "You own"-as I scanned the restaurant, I tried not to curl my nose because two unattractive looks in a row was like committing high treason in the Eve world-"this place?"

"I co-own it. Tom is the other co-owner, but he runs the place. All I do is come in and eat the food and drink the beer." As proof, Henry lifted his beer and took a drink.

I knew Henry. As much as I hated to admit it, and hated even more that after his betrayal and our years of separation, I still felt like I knew him. It was easy to tell that he'd given me half of the story, but not the important half.

"Are you going to make me pry it out of you, or should I go ask single, lonely Tom, who'd probably sign his co-ownership of this place over to me if I batted my eyelashes at him?" To prove my point, I fluttered my eyelashes a few times at Henry.

He smiled. "You got something in your eyes?"

Could I cut a break with my Target? And no, Universe, that was not a rhetorical question. Give me a f**king break already.

I moved to slide out of the seat because it looked like I'd be getting my answers from Tom, but Henry grabbed my arm.

"I used to come to this place a lot when I moved up here after college, when I was in the process of putting my company together," Henry said as I settled back into my seat. "I can't count the number of nights he let me camp out at whatever booth I was in, scratching away pages of notes, cranking out code like a mad scientist, after he'd closed and gone to bed in his apartment upstairs. He just told me to help myself to whatever I wanted and to be sure to lock the door on my way out." Henry smiled as his eyes went to some other time and place. "I conceptualized most of what Callahan Industries started out as in these booths with a few pints of this stuff." He flicked his Guinness. "A couple years back, Tom had a stroke. Nothing that left him too permanently incapacitated, but he wasn't able to work for a couple of months. Since he's pretty much the only person who runs this place, day and night, he had to close it until he could come back."

I already knew where his story was going. That's how well I knew Henry. That's how well I wished with whatever was left of my heart that I didn't know Henry.

"Bills piled up, from the restaurant and the hospital, and no money was coming in. Tom was going to have to close the place. A business he'd opened forty years ago, all because of one terrible, unforeseeable curve life threw him. His whole life was going to be pulled out from beneath him all because of one moment, one instant." Henry's eyes were still in that far off place, but I couldn't help wonder if the story had shifted from Tom to someone else whose life had changed in one moment from one accident.

"So you stepped in with your deep pockets and saved the day," I said.

He shook his head. Adamantly. "I didn't save the day, Eve. All I did was even the scales a bit. Life is a fickle bitch and wants to give you a hand up just as much as she wants to shove you back down. If I'm in a position to help those who have fallen on her sword like I have, I'll damn well do it."

His eyes weren't somewhere else anymore. No, they were right there, blazing before me. Henry rarely did impassioned, but what he'd just said and how he'd said it clearly indicated that when he did do impassioned, he did it exceptionally well.

"When did you fall on fate's sword, Henry Callahan?" I leaned forward. He'd lived, by all definitions of the concept, a charmed life. He grew up with wealth and privilege. He had a mind geniuses before him would envy, a body that girls wanted to run their hands all over, and one of the top IT companies in the nation. As far as victims of fate's sword, Henry was somewhere at the end of the line.

Henry tilted his head, studying my face for long enough I wanted to shift in my seat. Of course I didn't-shifting under a man's penetrating stare was for amateurs-but I wanted to.

After clearing his throat, he answered. "The day you walked out of my life." My mouth snapped open to utter, accuse, or holler something, but Henry cut me off. "Correction-the day you sprinted out of my life."

I wanted to glare at him, but I couldn't. I wanted to splash a glass of water in his face, call him a vile name, and march out, but I couldn't. I wanted to slap his face before turning around and sprinting out of his life again, but I couldn't.

The Eve I'd been born wanted one thing, but the Eve I'd become had to do the opposite.

Whatever it felt like to live in harmony with myself, I was on the planet farthest away from that happy little place.

"Paperwork." I eyed the stack beneath Henry's arm. Apparently I was on the planet pretty damn far away from a land of smooth transitions, too.

Henry watched me for a few seconds-waiting for me to say something-before sighing. "Yeah, paperwork." His gaze shifted from me to the stack, and he thumbed through it. "Most of it is already filled out so we won't be here until next week. I just mainly need some signatures."

It looked like just about everything had been filled out except for the signatures. When I thought about who had filled out something as mundane and tedious as my paperwork, my stomach coiled. Part of my plan was to surprise the shit out of Ms. Gatekeeper, aka the competition. No doubt filling out pages and pages of an application for some young woman who the boss had taken an interest in had alerted her.

"From the looks of it, your secretary's hand must be ready to fall off." The silver lining? She'd only have one set of claws to come at me with.

"I don't know about her, but mine's one page away." Henry gave his hand a dramatic shake.

"You filled out my paperwork?" My eyebrows came together.

"Yeah, who else would have?" Henry shrugged as though it was obvious. "Besides, Eve, who knows you better than I do?"

Myself. But that was a lie. Other than being consumed by revenge and an illicit career, I'd lost my bearing a while ago. I was still moving ahead and not necessarily aimlessly, but somewhere along the way, I'd misplaced my compass. The only thing worse than losing it was having no clue where to search for it.

So instead of answering with a blatant lie or arguing that he didn't have a clue who I was, I ignored his comment altogether. When in doubt, playing ignorant, avoidance, or ignoring worked well. "You might need a Social Security Number along with those signatures, right?" Take that, Henry Callahan. You don't know everything about me. Insert tongue sticking out here.

"Well, actually ..." Henry flashed the first page in front of me.

I would have choked on the Guinness Tom had just slid in front of me if I'd taken a sip. "How the hell do you know my Social Security Number?" I almost yelped before catching myself. My emotion had flared, and I'd fallen out of character. I couldn't fall out of character with Henry, not if I was going to get the Errand done. "I mean ... how did you know it?"

Henry took a sip of his beer and didn't seem eager to meet my stare. "You told me it one night. Back when we were together. Do you remember?"

I searched my memories of my time with Henry. Since I'd tried to set fire to each one of them, I had a difficult time finding the one he was talking about. I shook my head.

"It was late. We'd spent half the night working on a school project and the other half of the night-"

My glare stopped him mid-sentence.

He ran his fingers through his hair before continuing with a story that hopefully wouldn't remind me of those nights we'd shared hitting the books before moving to the bed. Or whatever was close by. "We were laying there-I thought you were almost asleep-when you listed off nine numbers. You repeated them and told me if I ever lost you or if you ever lost me, I could find you no matter what. I knew your 'code,' so I could never lose you."

I had to take a full two breaths before I could reply. "I said that?" After grabbing my Guinness, I took a long sip. Henry'd been right; I did want and need that beer. "Because it doesn't sound like something I'd say. 'You know my code?' Come on, that's lame."

Henry's face formed a small smirk. "We're computer nerds. We speak, dream, and code in lame."

"Wow, so some girls bake their boyfriends a nice dinner, or give them half of some girly locket, or ... give them a bl*w j*b, and I gave you my Social Security Number?" I gave my head a shake. Just because I couldn't remember that night didn't mean I didn't believe Henry. I wouldn't remember those more intimate memories-they had been the first to go.

Henry clasped his hands on the table and leaned forward. "I liked knowing your 'code' way better than some homemade dinner or locket. And if it's any consolation, you gave me plenty of-"

Warning glare number two. That one was twice as potent as the first one, though.

"Sorry. The memory train kind of got away from me."

Henry shifted in his seat. I wished I could be certain it was because of the glare I was still aiming his way rather than what he was replaying in his mind. Given that his cheeks were coloring, I guessed the latter was more likely.

"Speaking of your memory"-I raised my eyebrows-"you're telling me that after this many years, you still remember those nine numbers? You remember 'my code'?" No, I didn't try to keep the sarcasm from my voice, and no, I didn't feel badly for it.

Henry's head tilted. "And you're telling me that you'd expect me to forget something like that?"

"It's not like I'm your wife-just the almost one-so yeah, I wouldn't expect you to remember my Social Security Number after five years." At least I withheld my wince. That was about the only thing I did right in that bitter, wrong-on-every-level answer. How many times did I have to remind myself that I was with Henry as an Eve, not as the other one?

Let's see, I suppose I was at close to two thousand reminders, so maybe a couple thousand more times?

Henry flattened his palms on the tabletop and looked up at me. His expression gave away that he was as conflicted as I was angry. "Do you want to splash your beer in my face? Do you want to slap me or take a swing or get on the table and scream about what kind of a sorry excuse for a man I am?" A flash of pain crossed his face-one that didn't flash away quickly. "Do you want to do and say all of the things you didn't get a chance to before running out of that room that morning? Because"-he spread his arms wide-"I'm right here. I won't stop you. I won't hold a grudge. In fact, it might be something of a relief because I'm certain you can't do anything worse to me than I've already done to myself."

I highly doubt that. His tune would change when his entire empire crumbled down after I'd ripped apart the foundation. One day soon, Henry Callahan would realize he could do nothing worse to himself than what I'd already put into action.

Folding my hands in my lap, I gave him a conventional smile. "If I wanted to throw my beer in your face, or slap you, or scream at you, or have you castrated, I would have done so already." Henry didn't flinch. No, he kept his eyes locked on mine. "If I was here for payback, I wouldn't have worn silk and stockings. I'm here for paperwork and paperwork only."

Okay, so that was a lie. As far as payback went, I worked best in silk and stockings. Made the Errand quicker if I showed up in them instead of boxing gloves and a mouth guard. I just took my jabs and victories in other ways.

Henry handed me the pen then slid the stack of paperwork in front of me. "Paperwork and paperwork only. Got it."

My proverbial eyebrow rose. We'll see.

As I worked my way through the stack, signing this page and that page and five hundred other ones, I scanned each box. Henry really had filled them all in. His blocky, slightly slanted writing was impossible to mistake. He'd filled in my school history and personal information. For prior job experience, he'd only filled in one: Private Contractor. My breath caught in my throat for a moment when I saw that. I had to remind myself Henry meant private contracting in the tech industry, not in the illicit one I really was a part of.

"I know what you've been up to in your professional life ..." I said, "but what about the rest of your life? If you even have time for a personal life."

I kept my eyes focused on the paperwork and waited. Normally I didn't ask Targets that kind of question because I already knew their personal life. My own morbid curiosity had just asked Henry that, not my better judgment. I wanted to hear him lie; I wanted to be reminded of the man I was sitting across from ... more like I needed to be reminded of it. When he hmmm'd and hawww'd, conveniently forgetting to mention his wife, my resolve would be renewed and I'd forget all about the man who still remembered my Social Security Number and could look into my eyes with a sincerity that made me want to squirm.

"A personal life?" Henry took a sip of his beer then a longer one. "What I have outside of work seems to grow smaller and smaller by the day, and well ... it's called a personal life for a reason." Henry shrugged, giving me some combination of an apologetic and sad look.

I wasn't sure what irritated me more: that he hadn't outright lied or that he'd gone all vague when I needed him to be anything but. Either way, I was irritated. That might have been why I said what I did next. "And how many of those personal lives are you living?"

Bitter bitch, get back into your cell before I send you to the electric chair.

If Henry flinched, I missed it. Probably because I was busy administering some good ol' self-flagellation.

"What about you? What's your personal life like these days?" he asked quietly.

My reply wasn't so quiet. "They call it personal for a reason."

Instead of taking my comment as cutting, Henry smiled. Actually, he grinned right before he laughed. "I should have known better than to show up in a suit and tie for a meeting with you, Eve. Next time I'm strapping on the full-body armor."

Damn it if I didn't try to hold it in, but a traitor smile broke on my face. "And next time, I'm bringing the grenade launcher. Let's see how your body armor holds up to that."

Henry lifted his beer and held it my direction. "Eve, you could bring nothing but that sad smile of yours, and it would blast through the most impenetrable suit of armor I could find every time."

I wasn't sure what to say to that, so I clinked my glass against his. "I'm not sure if that was deserving of a Cheers, but why the hell not."

Right before we both took a drink, Henry said, "Against everything I'd always thought, here you are. Sitting across from me, sipping a beer instead of launching it in my face. I'd say that's deserving of a Cheers."

That wasn't what I'd been referring to, not by a long shot, but as was becoming a pattern with Henry and me, he seemed to be talking about one thing and I was talking about something else.

The Meet

YESTERDAY I WAS in California, sharing not one but two pints of Guinness with Henry Callahan as we finished my employment paperwork. Today I was in Tampa, exchanging the dry, hot air of California for wet, hotter air. I wasn't a big Florida fan, but I spent plenty of time there. Lots of cheating, wealthy husbands in that state.

Henry got a call toward the end of our lunch "meeting" that he was needed urgently at one of his sister companies in Korea. I knew Henry traveled a lot and I'd be working other Errands when he was gone. While I had been okay with juggling a busy schedule, it was only because G promised I wouldn't jet-set across the country every other week. Yet there I was, flying a few thousand miles for a measly Seven.

I'd been about to complain to G when she'd informed me of the new Errand ... but then she said the magic words. The ones she knew would make me travel to the most remote part of the Arctic: wife beater.

Very little surprised me. I'd seen it all, lived it all, and worked it all. There wasn't a vice scratching the underbelly of humanity that hadn't gotten my hands dirty, but that kind of vermin-the wife beaters-gave a whole new meaning to why I did what I did. Every wife we Eves dealt with was looking for freedom, some just needed it more than others. Their lives depended on it. I wouldn't ascribe the word noble to my work, but it sure as shit wasn't something to be ashamed of either. That kind of Errand, with that kind of Client, had a succinct way of reminding me.

G hadn't needed to ask twice if I'd take the Errand. Henry was out of the country for a week, and a wife beater needed a beating of his own.

It was only late afternoon when I slipped into my rental car outside the Tampa airport, but I'd passed the fatigue point several hours earlier. I was used to a crazy schedule, where sleep was an afterthought, but even though my mind had adapted to exhaustion, my body hadn't. With my thirtieth birthday looming a few short candles away, I was reminded how, with every Errand I worked, I was that much older, that much more susceptible to wear and tear, and that much more in need of my exit plan. Closing the Callahan Errand would make my exit plan a reality. I'd be out of the game before I blew out those thirty candles. Hopefully, long out.

That was what was on my mind as I sped toward the Meet with Mrs. Tucker, my Client. The address I was heading for was a private residence ... as in the Tucker's home private residence. That was a first. I'd never met a Client at their home. It was too personal, for them and for me. They didn't want me to see pictures of their smiling family any more than I did.

Mrs. Tucker, however, had requested we meet at her home because she didn't drive. No, Mrs. Tucker wasn't crippled or temporarily incapacitated or had her license revoked. Mrs. Tucker didn't drive for a far more tragic reason: she was a victim of domestic violence. At its origin, domestic violence was about asserting control. It might start out as him occasionally checking his girlfriend's or wife's call list on her cell phone. Then casually checking turns into routinely, turns into taking away the phone, so on and so forth.

Domestic violence is about control, whether that manifests physically or mentally. That Mrs. Tucker didn't drive any longer was a ginormous red flag that Mr. Tucker had some serious steel hooks deep into her.

When I stopped in front of 415 Brambleberry Drive, one thing stood out: it was immaculate. The house was only a couple rooms shy of being a mansion. The windows sparkled in the late afternoon sun. The flowers lining the walkway were so perfect they could have been silk, and if there was a speck of dirt out of place in the rest of the landscape, I was about to be elected the president of the local P.T.A.

The place gave off the vibe of being ideal in every way, which meant that was exactly what wasn't happening on the other side of those glimmering windows. Plus, the eight-foot, wrought-iron fence around the perimeter didn't exactly give off a friendly, welcoming vibe.

I was about to pull up to the gate and page Mrs. Tucker when a woman in the shadows of the ivy stepped out of her hiding spot. I didn't need to have seen the photo in her file to know the woman was her. That vacantness in her eyes, paired with the way she moved like a feral cat, screamed that she was a woman who'd seen more fists than open arms in her marriage.

My blood heated.

My passenger-side window was rolled down before she took another step in my direction. "Mrs. Tucker, are we still on for the Meet?" I tried making eye contact with her, but her eyes went nowhere but the sidewalk.

She nodded. "Yes, but just in case my husband shows up earlier than expected, I thought we could meet across the street at the park. You know ... if that's all right with you, of course."

I smiled sadly. Like her home, Mrs. Tucker was immaculate. There wasn't a wrinkle in her linen pant suit, nor a hair out of place on her head. She was beautiful in an understated, unaware kind of way, and her few touches of makeup couldn't hide the grapefruit-sized bruise mottling her cheek. "Of course it's all right." And probably a good idea.

While I wasn't worried about what would happen to me if Mr. Tucker arrived home early to find a strange woman in the house, I was concerned for what might happen to Mrs. Tucker. The job was a balance of every shade of discreet, for every kind of reason imaginable.

"Do you want to hop in and I'll drive you over?" I asked. The park was literally across the road, but it felt odd to just drive off and leave the woman alone.

"No, I'll walk. Just in case any of my neighbors are watching." As if being reminded of them, she scanned the block. "I'll meet you at the bench in front of the duck pond." Without another word, Mrs. Tucker gave one more frantic scan of the block before hustling across the street and disappearing into the park.

I sighed before easing the car into a parking spot. That Errand would be tough-not because of the Target, but because of the Client. Whether I saw a sliver of myself in Mrs. Tucker or she'd already found my heartstrings and started tugging, or whether I was just one woman standing up for another woman who'd forgotten how to hold her shoulders high long ago, let alone her head ... the Errand was already too personal. And I had yet to make it through the Meet.

Despite whatever I was feeling, I couldn't lose sight of one thing: I had to wrap the Errand up within the week. It was either wrap it up in a week and get back to California or I'd have to abandon it. I didn't need G screaming through the phone at me that we wouldn't allow a Seven to get in the way of our coveted Ten.

I wouldn't abandon the Errand for my own pride, and I sure wouldn't do that to Mrs. Tucker. It didn't take an expert to assess that she was at the end of her rope.

After parking, I grabbed my briefcase and followed the path that I hoped would lead to the duck pond. I hadn't thought to ask just how far in the pond was-given Mrs. Tucker's paranoia, it could have been a state away-but once I crested the first hill, I saw it. The park wasn't large, and it was surprisingly quiet for a mild day. I suppose when every house surrounding the park had its own park-like landscape, it wasn't anything special.

I made sure to make plenty of noise as I approached Mrs. Tucker. She was clearly anxious, and I wasn't sure if that was because of our clandestine task or if that was her steady state.

"Mrs. Tucker?" I called when I was still a good ten feet back.

She still jolted, but at least she didn't bolt. "I've got all of the information you need." Her voice wobbled and her hands shook as she pulled a manila envelope from her oversized purse. "Everything you need should be in here."

I was faced with two options. I could grab the envelope, give her the do-this-or-else lecture, the phone, and take off and try to forget the bruised woman on a park bench in Florida. That was the easy road. The hard road was the one I went with because ... why the hell not? Life wasn't a cakewalk, so why start down easy street that late in the game?

"How long's he been hitting you?" I asked as I sat next to her. I could have gone with a smoother introduction, but talking about the weather seemed like a crime when Mrs. Tucker was clearly in need of help. If she'd called us, we were the last card in her Rolodex.

Her hands twisted in her lap. "Such a lovely day, isn't it? I might go for a walk later-"

"Mrs. Tucker." I covered her hands with one of mine. Hers were cold despite the warm weather. "I'm not your friends at the country club, or your family who wants to keep up the blind-eye act, or a meddling neighbor. I'm the person here to help you."

Her eyes closed. "How can knowing how long my husband has beaten me help you help me?" Her tone matched her expression-hopeless.

I waited for her to open her eyes. When she finally did, I waited until she looked me in the eye. "Motivation," I stated, lifting a brow. "The more motivation I have to close an Errand, the faster I get it closed."

She nodded a few times but stayed quiet.

"So?"

Her eyes closed again, but her mouth finally opened. "Three months, one week, and four days after our wedding." She paused, took a shaky breath, and continued. "My husband has been beating me for twenty years, one month and eighteen days."

My stomach coiled. Not that I needed more motivation, but twenty years gave me a special surge of it. "You've been keeping track. Why?" God, if I found myself in that kind of a situation, one thing I wouldn't do was mark the days off on a calendar. I'd try to forget them.

Lifting her gaze slowly, her head followed. For the first time, I saw something blaze to life in Mrs. Tucker's eyes that gave me hope she was still alive somewhere deep inside that shell. "Motivation."

Damn. Somewhere deep inside that shaky, seemingly scared shitless shell was a brave and motivated woman ready to break free.

"Why have you stayed with him this long?" I asked.

She lifted a shoulder and followed it with a sigh. "The first ten years I hung around because I kept hoping that I'd wake up and whatever demon had taken him over would be gone and he'd be the man I fell in love with. When I finally stopped being naive, I stayed with him because of our kids." She twirled her wedding ring around her finger, practically glaring at it. "Of course I realize staying in an unhealthy relationship for the kids isn't the best reason-"

"But it isn't the worst either."

Mrs. Tucker wiped her eyes, although I didn't notice any tears. Maybe they were only phantom ones. Maybe she'd stopped crying the real kind long ago, when she realized nothing would change no matter how many she shed. Until today. Today, everything was about to change.

"I managed to explain the bruises and bandages for a long time, at least until the kids were in high school. But when I was covering a different body part every other week and picking up a new box of Band-Aids every time we visited the grocery store, they each figured it out eventually."

"What did they do?"

Mrs. Tucker almost smiled. It was so close, it almost counted. "They got out. They escaped. One's in college on the East Coast, and the other's playing semi-pro soccer in Washington. They spread their wings and flew away. They did what I should have done long ago."

"But that's what you're going to do now." I twisted toward her and slid the envelope from her hands. "It might have taken you a while, but you're leaving him now and that's what matters. Not that you maybe hung around for too long, or that you may have stayed for the wrong reasons, or that you're scared witless to do what you're about to. What matters is that you're doing it."

Mrs. Tucker's eyes met mine again. "What matters is that I'm taking him down in the process. What matters is that he's going to feel what's it's like to feel his whole life slipping away from him. What matters is that he won't be able to control it. I'm taking that from him. I'm going to be the one hovering over him when this is over. That is what matters."

"You're doing this to get even," I stated. I was fine with that. Even was good enough reason for me. Hell, at the end of the day, I didn't need a reason. When the term domestic abuse came up, that was all the reason I needed.

Mrs. Tucker shook her head. "Revenge," she stated, her eyes narrowing. "I'm doing this for revenge."

So Mrs. Tucker had a bit more fight inside of her than I'd thought. Good for her. "You're divorcing the bastard and taking him for half of everything." I gave her a nod. "That's a solid case of revenge if I've ever heard one."

"I've got twenty years' worth of revenge to dole out. If there was a way to take him for more, I would."

I dropped the envelope into my briefcase. I needed to wrap things up. Time was a luxury I never had. Especially time with the Client. "You realize that when this is done and you've got the damning evidence you need, you're going to have to get out of that house and stay away from him while you file for divorce, right? He can't be anywhere close to you or know where to find you when he receives those papers. You know that, right?"

That speech wasn't in my job description. I didn't council or advise or offer post-marital counseling. My job was one thing and one thing only-to seduce the husband and open up that pre-nup loophole. Something about Mrs. Tucker, however, left me conflicted. She wasn't just married to a cheater-she was married to a man who beat her. I didn't know what he'd do when he found out she was leaving him, but I knew enough to guess it wouldn't turn out well for Mrs. Tucker. Whether it meant a few more bruises, or some mental blows that would leave permanent scars, or if he was one of the crazy ones who came at her with a loaded gun, I wouldn't be able to sleep well if I didn't say my piece.

"I've already got that figured out. I have a couple of suitcases packed and hidden and an emergency fund I've been stowing away for years. I know exactly what I need to do. I'm ready. All I need is for you to do your part, and I'll be free." She exhaled as a shadow of a peaceful expression came over her face. "I'll finally be free."

I gave Mrs. Tucker's hands a squeeze before rising. The sooner I got the file studied, the sooner I could arrange the Greet with the Target and the sooner I could stick it to that a**hole. Mrs. Tucker focused while I gave her the standard Meet lecture and when I gave her the phone, her eyes went a little glassy. "You know what the ironic thing about this whole thing is? If I could do it all again, knowing what kind of a man Rob would become, that wouldn't stop me from marrying him. I'd do it all over again."

My forehead creased. "Why's that?"

She stopped twirling the ring on her left hand and lifted her right. She wore another ring on her right ring finger. One with two different gemstones. Mrs. Tucker smiled at it. "Because I got my two angels from that devil of a man. Because I might have had to endure twenty years with him, but I get to spend the rest of my life with them." She polished her thumb over the ring before setting her hand back in her lap. "They were worth it."

I smiled conventionally and waved as I left Mrs. Tucker. The thing that stuck with me most about our conversation was that I didn't doubt what she'd said. She would go through another twenty years at the mercy of a pair of fists in exchange for her children. When I slid into the car, I was hit with a wave of depression that my whole life, I'd only loved one person like Mrs. Tucker loved her children. There'd been a single soul I'd walk through hell for.

He was the same person who was responsible for dropping me in hell and leaving me there. The person I was seeking my own revenge on.

Love is positively f**ked up.

The Greet

MR. TUCKER'S FILE WAS probably the least surprising one I'd ever gone through. Since I already knew he beat his wife, the rest was easy to fill in. I know that stereotypes were generally frowned upon, but in my business, stereotypes were less about labeling and more about math. To an Eve, stereotypes were a rudimentary form of probability and statistics.

I could study a Target's file until my fingers were numb, but no amount of paperwork could prepare me for every situation that might arise with the Target. So I read the file, took what I learned, and applied the stereotypes I'd picked up along the way to improvise my way through an Errand. Yes, I planned. Sure, I manipulated. But I improvised just as much, if not more.

Rob Tucker owned a string of car dealerships throughout Florida. His commercial and billboard advertising included him in every shot, with his blinding white smile, too-bronze tan, and bloated ego. Looks-wise, he was attractive for a man in his fifties, but he was aware of it ... although he was probably inflating his looks by double. Mr. Tucker probably couldn't pass a mirror without stopping and smiling at himself before making a douchy pistol shot.

He wore tight polos to show off the biceps he worked out five days a week. That explained why Mrs. Tucker's bruises went deep and hung around longer than most. He drove a Corvette-yes, a red one-played poker on Friday night with his "buds," and played eighteen holes of golf on Saturday. On Sunday, he religiously rose early and went to church with his wife, and sometime after, he religiously struck her across the face for drying out the pork roast, or undercooking the haricot vert, or making the custard too soupy. Mrs. Tucker's notes were detailed in a way I'd never seen. She was taking it seriously, at least five steps more serious than any of my other Clients. If she could do that, I'd step my serious scale up five steps, too.

From the amount of time Mr. Tucker spent at gentlemen's clubs, he could have a regular customer punch card. Though she couldn't prove it, he'd had a handful, if not a small army, of affairs with employees, friends' wives, prostitutes, and quite possibly a couple of neighbors.

As stereotypes went, Mr. Tucker threw the general curve by several points.

After spending the majority of the night perusing the file, I got up early to send Henry a quick email to let him know I needed a week to wrap up something before I could start at Callahan Industries.

Not even two minutes after hitting send, his response pinged in my inbox:

Vacation requests already? What have I gotten myself into? Have fun wrapping whatever-that-something-is up. -HC

Henry didn't have a clue what he'd gotten himself into. Not a clue. That was my first thought after reading his reply. My second was to let a smile creep out right before I hit reply.

How's it going on the other side of the world?

Before I could type anything else, I rushed to slip on my heels, grab my purse, and head for the door of my hotel room. Another ping from my laptop stopped me. I should keep going and check it later. My focus needed to be on and stay with the Tucker Errand, not exchanging pointless emails with Henry.

I hurried over to check my laptop. My focus wasn't as ironclad as I'd always believed.

Let's just say I'm going to need another Guinness the instant I step foot on U.S. soil again.

Poor Henry. The days where his infectious smile and shrug could fix just about any problem were over ... and what was I doing thinking Poor Henry? If that wasn't the last time I put those two words together, I would wrap a rubber band around my wrist and snap it each time I even thought about pairing Henry's name with the word poor.

G had booked another penthouse for me, so after making my way down thirty floors, I stepped out of the elevator and headed for the rental car that was already waiting for me at valet. My car was nice, but not as nice as I was accustomed to. That was because I was about to go shopping for a really nice car at a nearby car dealership.

Tucker Automotive Group.

Yes, the abusive bastard had named his company after himself. Not exactly the surprise of the century. Or even the hour.

According to Mrs. Tucker's notes, Mr. Tucker didn't work directly with the customers anymore. He mainly stuck to running the business and screwing the conveyor belt of young assistants he had rotating through his office. But he made an exception for clients who were deemed "high profile"-aka wealthy ones shopping for cars in the six-figure range-or customers who were ... of the XY chromosome and genetically blessed.

My plan was to shop those high-ticket cars from the get-go to alert the big man that a deep-pocket customer was on the lot ... and I might have worn a skirt that was shorter than the typical one, a pair of heels higher than the average pair, and a blouse a bit tighter than most. Basically, if he didn't get the message that a high profile customer was there, I hoped he'd catch the other message.

I pulled up to Tucker Automotive to find a semi-sized sign with the tagline Shop the rest, then come visit the best alongside a photo of Mr. Tucker himself. I resisted the temptation to plow my rental car right through the billboard and proceeded to the parking lot. After I finished the Errand, if I still wanted to destroy that monstrosity, I could. That wasn't exactly the way I was hoping to catch Mr. Tucker's attention.

A small herd of salesmen in white dress shirts and red ties stood around the main building when I pulled up. I'd no more than put the car in park and every one of them was staring at me as if they were ready to pounce. I was contemplating how to steer clear of the rabid white-shirts when a flashy red sports car pulled into the spot beside me. A flashy red Corvette.

Bingo.

If that was a sign as to how the rest of the Errand would go, it would be a breeze. As I slid out of my car, I grabbed my purse, gave my hair a quick rumple, and played oblivious to the man crawling out of the hard-to-miss car beside me. I started up to the main building, but before I'd gotten to the curb, a low whistle came from the turd of a human to my left.

"This is a car dealership, sweetheart, not Heaven's gates, you know." Mr. Tucker's voice was, as suspected, overly confident and had a deep baritone quality to it.

I already knew where he was going with this whole "wow" greeting, but I played along. "What makes you think I'm looking for Heaven's gates?" I glanced at him as I stepped up on the curb.

"You're an angel, aren't you?" Mr. Tucker settled his hands on his h*ps as a slow smile moved into place.

I had dark sunglasses on, so I allowed myself an eye-roll. His eyes, however, weren't hidden behind sunglasses, and he wasn't shy about checking me out hardcore. His gaze circled my br**sts long enough I was tempted to remove my sunglasses and zero in on his crotch to see how he liked a stranger checking his goods out for that long. Then I realized a slug like Mr. Tucker would probably get off from a young woman checking out his (anti) goods.

"That's the first time anyone's ever called me an angel," I replied, knowing the role I needed to play, and it wasn't getting offended because the Target was eye-motor-boating my boobs. That he was doing that so early was a good sign that I wouldn't need much time or persuasion to get him into a "compromising" situation.

"Oh? What do they usually call you?" Mr. Tucker came around the front of his Corvette and stopped a few feet from me. "Because a guy can't help but want to call you something, sweetheart."

Other than sweetheart, you un-original creep? "Fiend seems to be in the top running."

Mr. Tucker lifted an eyebrow, his snaky smile still glued in place. "And why would people call you a fiend?"

I gave him a tilted smile. "That's a question for my ex-lovers to answer."

Mr. Tucker stepped closer. "I've always been more of a fiend fan than an angel fan."

"Then it's nice to meet you ..." I extended my hand and waited.

"Rob Tucker. CEO, President, and Owner of this dealership, as well as six others. Soon-to-be seven when the Miami store opens next month." He wrapped his hand around mine tightly before giving it a powerful shake. We were barely out of the gates, and he was already asserting his power over me. Classic beater behavior. "And what's a girl like you named? Other than fiend?" His index finger stroked the inside of my wrist, but the rest of his hand stayed locked around mine.

"Fiona. My name's Fiona."

"Fiona Fiend, eh?" Rob pulled on my hand to bring me closer to him. When I was close enough to detect his spicy cologne, he leaned in. "Now that's the kind of name a man wants to curse when he's f**king a girl."

Humanity never failed to amaze me. There I was, a stranger one minute ago, and he was whispering about f**king while a half dozen of his employees watched us with rapt interest. Employees who knew he was married with two kids. I doubt he'd care if they watched him bend me over the hood of his fancy car if I gave him the green light.

All of the men I worked with deserved what they had coming, but some deserved it most. Rob Tucker had just earned the blue ribbon for most deserving. I couldn't wait to bring the bastard down.

"You're right." I slid my sunglasses on top of my head so I could lock onto his eyes. "Fiona does have a certain ring to it when a man grunts it out as I come around him."

Rob's pupils dilated as he wet his lips. The Target was mine. I owned him. Just like that, in a handful of words and looks, along with a tower of innuendoes, I could name the time and place, and he'd be there an hour early.

"And where do I sign up for that ride?"

"I don't know. Do you think you meet the minimum size requirements to ride that ride?" I lifted my eyebrows before glancing at his zipper.

"If you've got a maximum size requirement, that's where I might be in trouble." He popped his h*ps forward so I could make out the tell-tale bulge behind his khakis.

I realized Rob wasn't only a dickhead, he was practically dickless. Maximum size requirements my butt. "Before we go any further discussing that ride, I need a different kind first."

Rob's eyes went wide again as his twisted mind started jumping for joy at the possibilities. Time to rein him in. Two steps forward, one step back. It was a game of finesse, and knowing when to pull back was just as critical as knowing when to surge forward.

Shifting my gaze to the car lot, I pulled my hand free of his. "I need a new car. Something nice, expensive but understated. Not exactly like the head-turner you drive."

"You turn enough heads without the car." Rob nudged me as he slid beside me. "You certainly turned my head. Both of them."

Too bad my sunglasses weren't back in place-I really could have used an eye-roll. "Are you going to sell me a car or keep trying to seduce me?"

"That depends. Is the seducing working?"

If that's what you call seducing, you need to fire your seduction instructor. "No, because seducing doesn't work on me. When I see what I want, I take it. Whether I want a man or not has nothing to do with his ability to seduce me. I'm un-seducible." I smiled to myself. That was true. I couldn't be seduced by any man-because I knew every last trick in the book. Identifying a seduction angle was easy when I'd worked every single one multiple times.

"And what about me? Am I one of those men you want?" There wasn't a hint of doubt in his voice. It was barely a question.

I glanced at him as I headed for a gunmetal Aston Martin. "I'm not sure yet. I'll let you know when I figure it out."

Rob followed me, sliding his hands into his pockets. Probably attempting to disguise a hard-on that didn't really need to be disguised since it was barely detectable. "You don't need to let me know anything, Fiona. You can just rip off your clothes and f**k my brains out when you're ready to admit that you feel the same animal attraction to me that I feel toward you."

Men used the term animal attraction as an excuse for wanting to screw a woman they'd just laid their eyes on. It wasn't animal attraction. Animals had more discretion than that. It was nothing more than a case of a degenerate human wanting to add another mark to his tally. In his imagination, he'd already scratched that mark into his bedpost.

"I want to test drive this." I stopped beside the Aston and crossed my arms.

He waited, probably hoping I'd go a few rounds on the animal attraction topic he was so eager to discuss. A few moments later, he accepted defeat. "That's a hundred and seventy-five thousand dollar car."

I tilted my head. "Do I look like I'm flinching?"

"Gorgeous and wealthy? My dick just grew another inch."

What Rob Tucker called inches, the rest of the world called millimeters.

"I'll run and grab the keys so we can take this baby out for a spin. You want to wait here or come with me?" Rob asked as he started across the lot.

"I'll wait here. Something tells me if I went with you, your interest in getting the Aston keys would shift to getting my skirt up around my waist." I leaned my hip into the Aston and gave him a hint of a smile.

"Skirt at your waist, panties at your ankles. That's the way I like my girls."

Twisting to the side, I lifted my skirt just enough to show off the side of my leg from hip to ankle. "Too bad I don't wear any panties. I hope that doesn't mess with your panties-at-the-ankles fantasy too much."

He did an exaggerated shiver before jogging toward the main building. "Only makes it better."

As I waited for Rob to return, I slid the Callahan business phone Henry had given me from my purse. I didn't know why-I needed to concentrate on the Tucker Errand since I'd just been exchanging sexual advances with the Target-but I was checking for messages before my better judgment could wag her finger at me.

Could I change your title from RandD Program Manager to CEO? I'm over it.

Despite trying not to, I smiled. I convinced myself that the only reason I was smiling was because Henry was texting me from Korea when he was supposed to be asleep. That meant I was getting to him. I certainly wasn't smiling because I enjoyed our game of back-and-forth.

I suppose. But I'll only assume the power and wealth of the position. I won't take on the headaches and obviously sleepless nights.

Rob was crossing the parking lot toward me, so I put the phone back and tried to wipe the caught-with-my-hand-in-the-cookie jar expression from my face. The instant I slipped the phone in my purse, I heard a new message chime.

"You think you can handle this baby?" Rob patted the Aston's trunk as he approached me. "There's a lot of power underneath that hood. It might be hard for a girl to handle."

If he called me girl again, I might have to knock out his front teeth. I grabbed the key as I headed for the driver's side. "Not this one." I didn't wait for him to buckle up before starting the car and punching it into gear.

"You ever driven a car this nice?" Rob clicked his seatbelt into place, sounding a bit unsure. It was the first time he'd sounded anything but arrogant. That probably had something to do with me zipping out of the dealership at forty.

"I've driven nicer. Much nicer."

I sped down the road the dealership was on, weaving in and out of traffic. By the time I'd hit the interstate, Rob was gripping the armrest as if he was about to die. I grinned.

"Nicer than this? That's hard to do," Rob said a while later. He'd finally relaxed enough it didn't look as though he was about to tear off the armrest.

The interstate was fairly quiet, and I really wanted to wrap the Errand up quickly. Those were the two reasons why I did what I did next.

Slipping a mischievous smile into place, I glanced at Rob, who was back to checking me out. Apparently he was convinced I knew what I was doing behind the wheel of a vehicle, and he was back to his usual dog self. Removing a hand from the steering wheel, I lowered it onto his lap.

"I don't know. It could be harder." I cupped my hand over him, eliciting a low moan from him.

"You keep that up, and harder's going to be the least of your worries."

And size isn't exactly the least of yours. Fitting my hand tighter around him, I slid it up and down until he was back to gripping the hell out of the armrest.

"I take it you've made up your mind when it comes to me," Rob panted, cupping his hand around mine and guiding it in a more frenzied motion.

Flipping across three lanes of freeway, I took the next exit and sped back toward the dealership. Mind you, I did that all one-handed while my other hand controlled a much less impressive "driving machine."

"I'm still a long ways from making up my mind about you." Total lie. I made up my mind about you before I hopped on the plane from San Fran to Tampa. "But there's no reason we can't enjoy ourselves while our minds are figuring things out." Yet another total lie. As far as enjoying myself goes, I'm on the other side of the galaxy.

Rob's face was going a shade of purple, and his breathing had morphed into something that more resembled grunting when I whipped into the dealership. I couldn't have timed it better. From the feel and look of it, Rob was two seconds away from singing the alphabet. I wanted him to know what I was capable of, but I couldn't give him the full wham-bam-thank-you-hand-ma'am yet. All men-as big of a stretch as it was to ascribe that designation to Rob Tucker-were hunters. If I gave Rob the hand job equivalent of the gold medal, there wouldn't be much left for him to chase. Sure, there'd be something, but I wanted as many "somethings" for him to chase as possible because I wanted to make sure he'd chase me into bed.

"Nice ride," I said as I stopped and slipped my hand off of his lap.

"Why, thank you," he said, adjusting his pants.

"I was talking about the car." Shoving the door open, I slid out of my seat.

His hand whipped out and grabbed my forearm. "Where do you think you're going?"

When he tugged my arm, it wasn't gently. In fact, I came close to wincing. So that's when it started-thirty minutes after meeting him. I'd worked other Errands with wife-beaters, but Rob Tucker was the first one who'd tried it on me.

I stared down at him, demonstrating that I wasn't scared or intimidated or whatever he wanted me to feel. "Wherever I want to go. Now be a good boy and let go of my arm before I make you let go of it."

He didn't listen right away, not that I'd expected him to. As I kept my eyes locked on his and my expression strong, his grip loosened.

"You make a habit out of leaving a man high and dry?" That menacing gleam was back in his eyes as he leaned over to stare up at me.

"Only the ones I'm undecided about." I wanted to shake my arm-Rob's grip had been that painful-but I couldn't let him see he'd gotten to me-physically or mentally.

"You're a tease."

I lifted an eyebrow. "You have no idea." Turning around, I walked away. I'd barely made it five steps before I heard his door slam and hurried footsteps following me.

"Dinner tomorrow night. Me and you."

Rob fell in line beside me, so I picked up my pace toward my rental car. Not because I was scared of him, but because I wanted him to be aware of his place in our "relationship": chasing after me.

"If you'd be honest with me about what you really had in mind for tomorrow night, I might actually give you an answer."

"Fine," Rob said, reaching for my arm again.

I stepped to the side and tucked my arm out of his reach. If he tried manhandling me one more time, I would show him how I handled a man like him.

"Fucking tomorrow night. Me and you."

Romance at its finest.

"We'll see," was my clipped reply as I opened the rental car's door.

Rob slammed the door closed, earning a glare. "Tell you what. How about I tell you the time and place, and you'll be there. I'm done playing your 'woman in control' routine." He stepped into me, so his chest was bumping against mine. Mr. Tucker might have been in his fifties, but he had the muscle-mass and strength of a much younger man. "Why don't you stop pretending you don't want me to bend you over right here and take you for all of Tampa to see? We can both cut the act."

For "most vile human being ever created," Rob Tucker had just secured the number one spot.

"This glare isn't an act. Me about to push you away isn't an act." Using my free hand, I gave his chest a hard shove. "Me about to get in my car and run you over if you don't get out of my way isn't an act. And me being undecided about whether I want you to bend me over and take me for anyone to see isn't an act." Giving him one more shove, I broke free of his hold and slipped into the driver's seat. Right before I slammed the door, I glanced at him. "So? Are you getting out of my way, or is my bumper going to have to help you with that?"

His expression went from infuriated to amused. "I sincerely hope you're as feisty in bed as you are out of it."

"No, Rob. You sincerely hope you get to find out." Slipping my sunglasses back over my eyes, I slammed the door, started the car, and reversed out of my parking spot so quickly, I left a little rubber behind. When I glanced in my rearview mirror, I saw Rob watching me speed out of the dealership with that same crooked smile on his face. I slammed my palm into the steering wheel a few times and screamed a few dirty words.

As far as Greets go, that one wasn't ideal. I'd let my emotions get in the way of my job. I'd let the Target get to me. I'd let him ruffle my feathers. Whether it was him asserting physical power over me after barely saying hello or that smirk of superiority he wore like a badge of honor, Rob Tucker had most definitely shaken me.

The whole goal of the Greet was to serve as a gateway to future encounters. I'd all but threatened to run him over, and that didn't parlay into a ripe environment for wanting to see me again. If I'd said and done the same things to another Target, I would have as good as failed the Errand ... but something about Rob Tucker led me to believe standing up to him might serve as a kind of catnip. I couldn't say for sure, and if I told G how the Greet had gone, her head would start revolving, but I had a feeling that instead of permanently alienating Mr. Tucker, I'd permanently ensnared him.

Either way, if he didn't find me like I guessed he'd try, I had to find some way to work my way back into his good graces. The job wasn't just another Errand; it was more like a mission. A woman's life depended on me doing my job correctly and succinctly.

I wouldn't fail her. No matter the cost.

The Heat

I HAD A bruise "bangle" on my wrist from Mr. Tucker's grip yesterday. I wasn't a person who bruised easily, either.

After returning to the hotel to regroup and figure out where to take that mess of a Greet, I decided I'd wait two days for Rob to come to me. Even though I hadn't told him my phone number or where I was staying or anything other than my name, I didn't doubt a man as well connected and ambitious as he was could find out anything he wanted to.

If he didn't come find me, it would be back to the drawing board until I'd worked out a plan to get the Errand closed. Two days. That was all the time I could afford before I'd have to go after him. I only had five days before I had to be back in California.

My schedule was getting out of control, and I had the lack of energy to prove it.

In an effort to bolster my energy stores, I wandered down to the hotel lounge and ordered an extra cherries cherry Coke while I went through Henry's file for the three thousandth time. I was looking for something I couldn't find. I wanted something to pop up that would explain everything. I was searching for the vice that would remind me of the kind of person I was dealing with on the Callahan Errand.

By the time I was almost finished my second soda, I still hadn't found anything. I'd thumbed through the file start-to-finish for the second time that night. I groaned and resisted the urge to punch something. As far as files went, Henry's was pristine. Mrs. Callahan's notes held no hint that Henry was the kind of husband who deserved to be taken to the bank and smeared by a messy divorce. There. Was. Nothing.

Other than what he'd done to me. That the one piece of evidence I had against Henry Callahan was what he'd done to me years before he'd even met Mrs. Callahan put me in a sticky spot. Especially since my traitor self emerged from time to time and pretended that nothing had changed between Henry and me.

If I didn't keep that image of Henry in bed with another woman while I had his engagement ring on my finger, the Errand would continue being exceedingly difficult. If I didn't separate myself from the man who seemed impossible to dislike, the Errand would turn into a disaster.

I was just looking up to catch the bartender's attention when someone practically stumbled into my view. It had only been a day-I could have sighed with relief. But then I noticed his stumbling was paired with glazed-over eyes and a flushed face, and relief became the last thing I felt. Alcohol paired with a man like Rob Tucker was like lighting a stick of dyn**ite.

"There's my girl," he said as he bumped into the chair across from me.

Trying to be casual yet quick, I shoved the Callahan file back together and stuffed it into my briefcase. Once it was locked, I composed my face and took a deep breath before looking at Rob. I'd been anticipating him finding me, but that was the second time a Target had stumbled upon me while I was studying an Errand file. Even though he was at least a few drinks away from comatose, it still made me feel like some Eve rookie.

"I thought I made it pretty clear yesterday that I'm no one's 'girl,'" I replied, crossing my legs and leaning back. Thankfully, I'd worn something appropriate to the lounge instead of my tank and yoga pants.

Rob grabbed the chair in front of him, pulled it out, and sat. He barely kept from falling out of it, though. "And I thought I made it clear that whatever I want, I get." He pointed his empty drink glass at me, almost in accusation. "I want you. So that makes you my girl."

I wanted to shake my head so badly. "You had trouble with that whole sharing concept in preschool, didn't you?"

"No. The other kids had trouble with my concept of sharing perhaps, but I had no trouble with that."

Spoken like a true narcissist. "Because you took what you wanted whenever you wanted it. Here you are, forty years later, trying to do the same to a young woman you don't know anything about other than her first name and that she likes fast, expensive cars."

Rob leaned across the table. "I know more about you than that. A whole bunch more." He wasn't quite slurring, which was a good sign. Well, a better sign.

"Like?" Catching the bartender's attention, I lifted my glass. I was definitely going to need a third one.

"Like that you're so hot for me, your panties would need changing if you wore any." A lazy smile that made me want to gag moved onto his face.

"And because you think you know that about me, you assume you know everything there is to know?"

Rob drained the last drop from his glass before slamming it down. "Everything I want and need to know."

Why did every conversation I had with him feel like some great challenge not to dry heave? Never mind. Rhetorical question.

"How did you find me?" I asked, thanking the bartender with a nod when she dropped my fresh cherry Coke in front of me.

"I can find anyone I want, whenever I want. This is my city. I own it." As the bartender passed him, Rob grabbed her arm and pulled her to a stop. The dude was all kinds of physical with all kinds of women. "Be a sweetheart and bring me two whiskey sours."

"Two?" The bartender glared at his hand wrapped around her arm. "Don't you think you've already had two too many?"

"No, I don't think so." Rob shook his head once. "And it's not your job to think. A girl's thoughts are never rational or worth verbalizing. So why don't you smile pretty, nod, and serve me my drinks like your gender was created to do?"

Wow. Okay, so there was a nastier monster hiding inside of Rob Tucker than I'd guessed. Nothing like a few too many drinks to bring out that monster.

Whipping her arm out of his hold, the bartender gave me a look that said she thought I was crazy for being the woman sitting across from him. I answered with a shrug-I was crazy. That came with the job.

"So you found me because you own this town. Got it. But explain to me why you wanted to find me so badly." I took a sip of my fresh Coke, keeping my calm and collected act strong. I wouldn't buckle under my emotions like I had yesterday.

"Me and you." He waved his finger between us. "We've got unfinished business."

I didn't need to clarify what that unfinished business was-it was pretty damn clear what he was talking about.

"And until we finish this business, you're going to pop up in every lounge I visit?"

Rob reached across the table for my hand, wrist, or arm. I wasn't sure, and I didn't wait to find out. I slid my hand off the table and folded my arm into my lap.

He said, "I'll be in every lounge, around every corner, down every sidewalk, and every shadow you feel behind you until you quit this whole hard-to-get act and give in to what we both want."

"You're doing all of this for sex? Searching all of Tampa for me, trying to intimidate me in a bar, threatening to stalk me day in and day out ... all because you want to get laid?" I shoved my chair back a bit, needing to put more distance between us.

"That's part of it." He glanced back at the bar, raising his empty glass and waving it about. If the bartender could flip him off with her eyes, she just had.

"And what's the other part of it?" I asked.

Rob smiled crookedly. "That's for me to know and you to find out."

Someone call the clever police because we've got a bright one here.

"Listen, Rob, let me return the favor and be frank." I leveled my eyes with his and reminded myself he was the Errand first, the enemy second. After I finished the Errand, he could move into the number one enemy spot. "I'm good with doing the casual thing. In fact, I prefer the casual thing because I'm a busy woman who doesn't have time for the mundane and tedious components of a relationship. Yes, I'm attracted to you, and I know you're attracted to me."

His eyes managed to go another shade of smug.

I continued, "But just because I don't play by plenty of the rules doesn't mean I don't have any. If you want to give this casual thing between us a chance, you need to stop acting like an overbearing, chest-beating gorilla. You're going to have to stop acting like you hold the power of where we go from here in your hands because, Rob"-I arched an eyebrow-"I'm the one who holds that power. So why don't you cut the act, and let's see where we can go from here?"

I took a deep breath. As a rule, I liked keeping my replies to my Targets short and succinct, but something about Rob Tucker made me verbally vomit. Not that he'd remember a single thing I'd said in the morning ...

"Yeah, here's what I heard." He lifted his hand and made a talking motion. "Blah, blah, blah. I'm stupid. Blah, blah, blah. I don't know what the hell I want. Blah, blah, blah. Why don't you just shut me up and show me what I want."

Boiling blood. One wouldn't think it could happen so instantly.

I had to bite the inside of my cheek to keep from snapping back with something I both would and wouldn't regret. I also had to sit on both of my hands to keep from punching him.

"How about I tell you frankly what you're really thinking?" Rob leaned so far across the table I smelled the alcohol rolling off of his breath. "You're thinking you want to keep up this strong-girl act because that's what Sufferance, bra-burning, and decades of 'supposed' gender equality has conditioned you to think. But that's not how you really feel. None of you women really feel that way because deep down inside of you, in those little strands of DNA, you were all created to serve, and be second, and give obedience like your lives depend on it. And because so many of you bitches have gotten away with 'equality' for years, that genetic code is begging to be punished for your disobedience. The core of what makes you what you are won't be appeased until you're back in your proper place." He didn't blink. He didn't flinch. He gave no indication that he didn't believe wholeheartedly in what he was saying.

My stomach twisted before bile crept up my throat. Of all the Targets I'd dealt with, Rob Tucker was on a plane all by himself. Really, I couldn't imagine the devil being so evil. I mean, at least he didn't discriminate who got to hang out with him in hell.

I rose from my chair, grabbed my briefcase, and looked down at him. "I'm going now. I think there's more than enough of you to keep yourself company."

Rob's hand whipped out again, faster than I'd guessed a drunk man could move. His powerful grip circled the same wrist, and my bruise pulsed with pain. "I wouldn't recommend turning your back on me. You started this thing. You damn well better finish it," he said.

I had to take two full breaths before I could reply. "Consider this, right here, me finishing this thing." Lifting my other hand, I waved my middle finger at him then pulled my wrist free. It took some serious pulling, but the instant he let go, I marched for the exit of the lounge.

He didn't call after me. He didn't scream, holler, and threaten. That Rob Tucker let me go silently and without a fight was disarming. So disarming, I checked over my shoulder every few steps in my journey to the elevator, making sure he wasn't hustling up behind me.

I'd never dropped an Errand, but I didn't see how I could keep that one. Rob Tucker was clearly a dangerous man. We Eves dealt with deceitful men, but dangerous ones weren't part of the deal. G had made it crystal clear from the start that if we ever found ourselves in a situation with a Target where we feared for our personal safety, we were to pull the plug. At that point, I wasn't only fearful for my personal safety-I was fearful for my life.

No one deserved to be in the kind of relationship Mrs. Tucker was, but how much farther could I take it before Rob became violent with me? How much longer was I willing to take that risk? I'd taken self-defense classes, and I carried a mini collection of weapons in my purse, but no amount of skill or measure of defense could guard against a person like Rob Tucker. He wasn't only violent-he was cunning. Violence alone was a red flag the size of the Pacific, but violence matched with intelligence was the deadliest combination known to humankind.

I knew if I called G to talk it over with her, there'd be no back and forth. She'd order me to drop the case and get back to California. She didn't want any of her Eves in a compromising situation, let alone the one working her coveted Ten. The majority of our domestic violence Targets kept their violence within their home. To date, I'd never heard of one raising his hand to an Eve ... yet I was one misstep away from being laid out by Rob Tucker's backhand.

So I was at an impasse. I couldn't just give up the Errand and wash my hands of Mrs. Tucker, yet if I kept pursuing Mr. Tucker, I was playing with fire. The kind that would literally burn me. Maybe I could hire some kind of body guard. One that hid in the shadows and only made themselves known when and if the occasion called for it ... but that seemed like a far cry from an ideal solution.

Whatever my decision, I'd have to make it by morning because time was one of the few luxuries we weren't allowed. Which meant I'd be getting very little sleep as I deliberated how to proceed. Good thing I'd just showed two and a half cherry Cokes how it's done.

Speaking of ...

Before stepping inside the elevator and heading to the top floor, I detoured to the little convenience shop in the lobby. Not that I needed any more liquid calories, but I could never get enough caffeine. Besides, I could run it all off on the treadmill in the hotel gym in the morning. After paying for another soda, a bottle of water, and a pair of nail clippers because I couldn't seem to find the ones I kept in my toiletry bag, I trudged for the elevator. The lobby was quiet, probably because it was close to midnight.

After sliding my card key into the elevator, I punched the top floor and leaned into the wall. While the penthouses in Tampa weren't as swanky as the ones in Seattle, my room was spacious and quiet. There was only one other penthouse, and I doubted if anyone had occupied it since I checked in.

Right as the elevator doors whooshed open, my phone chimed. One of my phones chimed. I carried close to half a dozen when I worked dual Errands. However, I knew the ring right away. I might have only heard it a couple of times, but it had somehow been committed to memory that quickly. It was my Callahan Industries phone, and to my knowledge, only one person had that number. Damn that smile that had slipped into place before I'd caught it ...

"What are you doing calling me this late?" I greeted, trying to sound stern, as I stepped off the elevator.

Of course, Henry chuckled. "How is nine at night late for you?"

Great, Eve. Way to go. The first words out of your mouth are already a mistake. Henry didn't know I was on the East Coast and that it was just past midnight. He thought I was in California.

"Well, it's later than where you are," was my So there comeback.

"Technically, it isn't ... since Seoul is eleven hours ahead of you."

I heard the smile in his voice, which made me imagine it, which made my own form. Again. Damn it. Damn it. DAMN IT.

"Could you tone your know-it-all down every once in a while for god's sakes? It's annoying." Stopping in front of my room, I set my bag of goodies on the floor to get the door open.

"You're already reprimanding me, and we haven't even exchanged a proper greeting."

I rolled my eyes and went to insert my card key into the door. "Hi, Henry." I used as syrupy a voice as I could muster.

"Hi, Eve." His was warm and genuine and reminded me of everything about Henry I'd fallen for so many years ago.

"Who's Henry?"

The sharpness and nearness of the voice almost made me jolt. I hadn't been expecting to hear that voice again, let alone on the private, restricted penthouse level.

"Eve? Who's that?" Henry's voice had morphed into something else-something that was a far cry from warm.

"It's okay, Henry. I'm fine." Turning around slowly, I dropped the phone to my side and put on a brave face.

Rob Tucker stood not even two feet in front of me, smelling, looking, and acting twice as drunk as he'd been when I'd left him in the lounge. Instead of a smirk, his face had something far more predatory.

"No, it's not fine." Rob stepped closer. That he could walk without stumbling indicated that he was drunk so often, he'd managed to perfect it. "But once we're done here tonight, we'll be a bit closer to fine."

"Eve? What the hell? Who is that?"

I just barely made out Henry's voice, but I couldn't find the strength to hang up the phone. Despite him being half a world away, I felt some semblance of safety having some part of Henry with me-his anxious voice coming through a cell phone included.

"How did you get up here?" I asked, glaring at Rob.

"There're two rooms up here, you know." Sliding a card key from his pocket, he flashed it in front of me. "When I said I own this town, I meant it, sweetheart."

Just as I reached into my purse to pull out the first weapon my fingers curled around, Rob grabbed my wrist and yanked me to him. I almost yelped but held it in. He was a predator, an intimidator, which meant he thrived off of his victims' submission. I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.

"And when I didn't say out loud that you're a brainless, dickless a**hole, I meant that too." I yanked against his hold, but he was strong and determined and drunk-the trifecta every woman learned to steer clear of if she made it through puberty.

"You women and your mouths. If you'd just figure out that hole was meant for the same purpose the other two were created for, there'd be no need for this."

My first thought was to thank god I'd covered the phone's speaker so Henry didn't hear that, but that was soon followed by rage. That kind of human being didn't deserve the oxygen he used.

"No need for what?" I seethed, stepping into him. By god, I wouldn't back away from him.

Shrugging, Rob answered, "For this." He reached his free arm back and brought it around until his fist connected with my jaw.

I'd been hit before. A bunch of times growing up with a mouth that had gotten me into trouble on the playground with the other girls, and one time from a piece-of-shit boyfriend in high school. I knew how to take a hit, but that one ... that hit leveled me.

The air rushed out of my lungs when I collided with the floor. The phone and my purse flew across the hall. I was aware of Rob standing over me chuckling, and that my ears were buzzing and my jaw was throbbing, but the only thing I focused on was the sound of Henry's voice through the phone. It had landed close to my head, and he sounded as worried as I should have been. He kept repeating my name like a mantra, and it was calming. Comforting even.

Once I felt as though my lungs weren't two deflated balloons, I twisted onto my back so I could pick up where I'd left off in glaring at Rob. The son of a bitch had hit me hard. He was going down. "Is that all you've got? So much for being a pinnacle of a man like you think you are."

The first thing that should have warned me things weren't going to end well for me was when he slowly rolled his sleeves up to his elbows. Anyone rolling up their sleeves with that maniacal of a smile was a sure sign no good was to come. The second sign? He undid his belt and pulled it from his pants as though he was preparing to use it as a weapon.

I scanned the hall for my purse, but it had gone in pretty much the opposite direction my body had. If I could unbuckle a strap and get off one of my heels, I could use that as a weapon. Then I saw the plastic bag sitting beside the door next to me. Where a couple of bottles and a pair of nail clippers sat. Nail clippers with a close-enough-to-a-knife file. If I could get to those, I could do a little damage.

As soon as I started to crawl toward the bag, I felt the first lash of his belt across my back. I was yelping from the first one when the second came, followed by a third and a fourth and so many more I lost track. Even through the crack of the belt and my howls of pain, I could make out Henry's voice. He called out for me, and the anxiety in his voice shifted to enraged.

Instead of crawling for the bag, I almost moved toward the sound of his voice. Then Rob tossed his belt aside and gave his feet a turn. When his first kick landed against my stomach, causing me to wonder if he'd liquefied all my internal organs with one blow, my primal sense of survival resurfaced, and my direction changed back to the plastic bag.

"This night could have gone so differently. If only you'd been the obedient girl I know you're dying to become." Rob's words were punctuated by his kicks, which were peppered with my cries, which were interrupted by Henry's shouts.

"I know what way you had in mind," I got out, spitting some blood. "Believe me when I tell you this is the better option."

Then another fist connected with the other side of my face. "How's that for better?"

I tasted blood, and my body throbbed from every part. I wasn't sure what, if anything, would be left of me when Rob Tucker was done. If anything was left, it wouldn't rest until I'd taken my revenge on him.

"Go to hell," I spit as my fingers closed around the plastic bag.

"Not until I'm done with you."

Another fist smashed onto my cheekbone. As I screamed from that hit, I managed to pull the bag close and fumble around until my fingers grazed cool metal. I worked fast to free the file, and just as Rob wound up for another punch, I flipped over and drove the file into his compacted fist. It went in deeper than I'd anticipated, and the pain almost instantly registered on his face.

"Go ahead. Hit me again. Or kick me. Or whip me." Sitting up, I held back my wince and held up my weapon. "I dare you."

Rob went from studying his hand as though he wasn't sure what had happened to glowering at me. From the looks of it, I was the first person who'd stood up to him. He seemed unsure whether to finish the job with me or turn, tuck his tail, and run.

"Come on, you spineless piece of shit. Hit. Me. Again." I arched my arm back, ready to drive the file into his eyeball if I needed to. Despite the beating I'd taken, my hand wasn't wobbling. My voice wasn't either. If my response to being brought as close to death as I'd been was being strong and not shaking, I could say with absolute certainty that I wasn't fragile. At least not anymore.

After a few moments, Rob's rage dimmed until a tilted smile moved into place. Then, flashing me a wink, he stood so he towered over me. I kept the nail clippers at the ready. At that position, they were heading for his balls if he tried anything.

"Until next time." His smile became wider as he studied me sprawled out below him. Bastard. "Be a good girl." He moved toward the elevator with purpose. He punched the down button, hopped on the moment the doors opened, and gave me one last wink before the doors sealed.

I sat there at the ready for another minute-my blood running down my face, my right eye swelling shut, my lower lip bulging-just in case he came back. When Henry's voice broke through my haze again, I let myself exhale before collapsing onto the floor. The adrenaline was siphoning from my veins, and without it, my body was spent. Every hit, every lash, every part of me seemed to scream with pain. It became too much for my brain to process.

I felt unconsciousness coming on when Henry's voice called out again. "Eve? Please. Are you there?"

Reaching for the phone, I managed to crawl an inch toward it before my energy stores were depleted. "Henry ... help."

"I'm here. I'm here with you. Help's on the way, okay?" His voice wasn't quite shaking, but it was close.

"Stay ... with ... me," I whispered, sure he couldn't have heard it.

"I'm here," he replied. "I'm not going anywhere."

His voice-his promise-was the last thing I heard before a darkness so deep came over me, I wasn't sure if I could ever make it to the surface again.

The Sheets

HOSPITAL SHEETS. THEY had a distinctive feel and smell a person could never forget. I was in them. Just beneath the haze of whatever drug cocktail they were pumping into my veins, I felt the dull throb of pain.

Where was I? How did I get there? Why did I come there? Those were the questions I wrestled with as I struggled to open my eyes. After blinking a few times to adjust to the light in the room, I scanned my mind for my last memory. When I couldn't find it, I tried searching for others ... but there was nothing. I saw them, but I couldn't decipher them. They meant nothing.

That wasn't the ideal way for a person to emerge from a who-knows-how-many-days sleep in a hospital. Some memory, any memory, that meant something would have been nice, but every last one of them was almost weightless, floating and meaning nothing.

Then the door clicked open and in walked a person who managed to give weight to all of my memories. They all fell back into place as he approached me with a worried expression. And that was when my last memory played out.

Me, reaching for a phone in a hotel hall, hurt and bloodied ... and a voice calling my name. His voice, promising he'd stay with me.

And there he was.

"Henry." I tried getting out more, but my throat felt as if it had been stuffed with a tower of cotton rounds.

"Hi, beautiful." He put on an unconvincing smile and stopped at the foot of my bed.

His suit was rumpled, his face unshaven, and the hollows of his eyes were two shades darker than normal. I couldn't decide who looked worse, Henry or me. I had yet to see myself in a mirror. As Henry carefully inspected me, the line between his brows went deeper and deeper. I guessed I won the worst-looking award. Noticing a container of water on the tray beside me, I propped up on my elbows and took a small drink from the straw. After another, the cotton feeling in my throat was gone.

"Beautiful? You always were a terrible liar," I said, my voice hoarse.

Henry came around the side of my bed and sat beside me. He grabbed my hand with both of his. "That's not a lie, Eve. After hearing what I did on that phone ... after hearing you scream and cry and those hits ..." Henry's eyes closed as he leaned his head into our connected hands. "Seeing you alive and in one piece is a beautiful thing indeed."

Given I was the one in a hospital bed, I should be the one who needed comforting. But the opposite appeared true. From the looks of it, Henry had been through more of a beating than I had. I lifted my free hand and combed it through his messy hair.

"What happened, Eve? Who did this to you? Why did they do this?"

The memories were back and meant something, so I searched for that one. It didn't take long to remember what had happened or who'd done it: assault, hotel hall, threats, unconscious, Rob Tucker.

Followed promptly by: Errand, Target, wife beater, Mrs. Tucker, freedom, Eve.

Shit, the Tucker Errand wasn't the only one I was working. The man warming my hand happened to be my Target too. What the hell was he doing there? In Tampa? He'd been in Seoul when I passed out with him still on the other end.

Had I managed, in one unfortunate instance, to compromise both Errands? They were both important to me-the Callahan one because of who was involved and the dollar signs tied to it, and the Tucker one because of the devil I was dealing with. If G knew Henry Callahan was sitting beside me in a hospital in Tampa when I looked as if I'd just gone toe-to-toe with a heavyweight boxing champ, she would probably breathe fire.

G ... what was I going to tell her? Good thing she was taking a vacation in Mexico and threatened that unless it was a matter of life and death, not to bother her. Since I was still, technically, alive, I used that as my excuse to not call her right that second to let her know what had happened. But I'd have to tell her eventually, and just what was I going to say?

I had too many questions and no time or mental fortitude to work them out. It might have been the haze of the drugs or the haze of Henry, but something was definitely messing with my ability to think clearly and logically.

"Eve? Did you hear me?" Henry asked quietly. "Who did this to you?"

He looked at me, and the darkness that flashed through his eyes was staggering. Henry had always been a think first, hit second kind of person. Given the look on his face, if Rob Tucker were to appear and I pointed at him in answer, I had no doubts Henry would have a moment of hit first, think second. But Rob Tucker wasn't there-thankfully-and Henry was waiting for my answer.

"I don't remember," I lied, needing to salvage whatever was left of keeping the Errands separate.

"You don't remember what?"

I sighed. Henry was a natural problem solver. That was part of the reason he was the president of a Fortune 100 company, but that also carried over into his non-business life. Which was a pain in my ass given my compromising predicament.

"Anything, Henry. I don't remember much of anything right now."

"But-"

I shook my head. "Please, thinking about it is only giving me a headache. I'm sure when my head is less foggy and I have time to work stuff out, it'll all come back to me."

He looked ready to go one more round of rebuttal, but he closed his eyes and exhaled.

What is he doing here? How did he find me?

"What are you doing here, Henry? How did you find me?" Of all the questions I had, those were the ones I couldn't stop repeating to myself.

"I'm here because you're in the hospital looking a bruise or two away from being in a coma." His forehead creased. "And I found you thanks to a Callahan Industries microchip locator."

My eyes widened as far as they could given their swollen state. "You had me microchipped?" I would have shrieked that if my vocal chords were up to the task.

"What? No." Henry shook his head. "Your phone. Every employee-issued phone is microchipped in the event-"

"In the event you might want to spy on an ex?" I raised an eyebrow.

"In the event one of my employees goes missing. I have employees who travel a lot to parts of the world that aren't exactly friendly to Westerners. The microchip was invented and installed as a life-saving device, not a spying one." Henry gave me a You satisfied? look.

"What you call life-saving I call life-spying," I replied.

"Whatever you call it, you can't deny that that microchip did, in fact, save your life."

"My life wasn't in danger."

Henry's eyes ran up and down me again. They narrowed as he took in my face. "And what you call not in danger, I call getting beaten to the point of camping out on death's doorstep."

He was right, of course, but I'd never admit that. Time to change the subject. "So what happened after I blacked out? Do you know?" I found the bed remote and raised the head of it so I was somewhere between sitting up and lying down.

"Before you blacked out, I'd already located you thanks to my laptop being glued to my hip everywhere I go, including the bathroom-"

"Eww, you were in the bathroom during all of that?" I curled my nose.

Henry rolled his eyes. "I'm exaggerating to make a point, Eve. Roll with me, okay?"

"I'll roll with you, just so long as it isn't into the bathroom."

He groaned. "Once I'd located you, I had one of my colleagues call the emergency system in the Tampa area to alert them that you needed help, along with where you were."

"So the ambulance showed up, rushed me to the hospital, and then we all lived happily ever after?" I scanned the room. If that was anything close to what HEA looked like, pass me the hemlock. "How long have I been unconscious?"

Henry gave my hand a gentle squeeze. "About two days."

Knocked unconscious for two days?! Rob Tucker had just made enemies with the single most spiteful person on the continent. I could do revenge like he could swing his fist.

"What are you doing here? I thought you had a crazy week filled with meetings and negotiations and Korean BBQ." I knew having Henry beside me should have been the opposite of comforting, but there was nothing else I needed more right then.

"Some things are business, and some things are important," he answered.

"For a man like you, don't those two things go hand in hand?"

His eyes locked onto mine. My heart picked up its pace, which I promptly attributed to the drugs. "I'm here with you now, aren't I? Does that answer your question?" he asked.

Things were as convoluted as they had ever been between Henry and me. Nice to see some things stay the same-insert sarcasm here.

"Thanks for being here," I said, working a smile into place.

He matched his smile to mine. "Where else could I be?"

Of course that would be the instant Mrs. Callahan came to mind. Somewhere out there was a woman wearing a wedding ring the man beside me had given her. Somewhere out there was a woman who'd hired me to seduce the man beside me so she could be free of him. Somewhere out there was a woman who wanted to leave Henry Callahan like I'd wanted to.

I wondered if Mrs. Callahan would be more successful than I had.

"I'm going to rest, I think. I'm pretty exhausted." My smile shifted into a fake one as my hand went cold. My heart might still react to Henry, but my brain knew the score. My mind would never forget what he'd done, or the reason I'd been reintroduced into his life, or why revenge should always be on the tip of my tongue when I thought of Henry Callahan.

Rising, Henry leaned over me and pressed a gentle kiss to my forehead. His lips should have felt like ice ... but they felt warm. "I'll be in the waiting room when you wake up." His eyes stayed on me as he headed for the door.

Only when he'd closed it was I able to take a breath. I was in bad shape, mentally and physically. A Target had been responsible for nearly killing me. Another Target was responsible for saving me. One Target I loathed more than I'd ever hated another person. The other Target was one I had to convince myself to hate, despite feeling quite the opposite.

And damn it, what was I going to tell G? The thought of it all made me as tired as I'd just tried to convince Henry I was. Lowering my bed, I curled into my pillow to fall asleep, hoping some of the what-nows would have been magically answered when I awoke.

I'd just closed my eyes when the door opened. I smiled, keeping my eyes closed. "What did you forget?"

"To tell you that the reason I do the things I do is because I care about you."

My eyes flashed open, my body curling inward to protect itself. I instructed myself to stay calm, to keep my breathing even and my face strong, but I wasn't sure if I was up to staying calm and strong when Rob Tucker got closer to me with every confident step. He had an overflowing bouquet of flowers in one hand, a large teddy bear in the other-the bandaged one from the file I'd unleashed on him-and a smile like he was congratulating his wife on giving birth to their firstborn.

"You have an unusual way of showing someone you care about them." My voice sounded almost as scared as I felt. That wouldn't work. I couldn't be scared. I wouldn't let a man like Rob Tucker reduce me to fear and cowering.

"But look at you now, sweetheart," he said proudly, setting the bouquet on the nightstand before tucking in the bear beside me. "I can already see on your face and hear in your voice that you're showing me more of the proper respect and reverence I deserve. I didn't hit you because I wanted to. I hit you because I had to. You needed to understand your role in this, as well as mine." After arranging a few of the flowers, he looked at me with a wide smile.

He was proud. He was looking at me as if I was his child who'd just taken her first steps. He was pleased with the way our relationship was progressing ... because laying a woman out so badly she was unconscious in the hospital for two days was the pinnacle of progress.

Rob Tucker had some seriously f**ked up views on relationships.

I had two options. I could lash back at him with my words and fists like I was twitching to do-right before pressing the nurse call button and screaming bloody murder. That option was appealing in just about every way possible.

The second option was trickier. Much trickier. I could play along with him in his twisted game. I'd have to play the beaten "girl" he'd pulled the spine right out of, and play pantomime in this sick relationship game. If I played along, I could free Mrs. Tucker and exact a sharper revenge on Rob Tucker. If I played the part of a weak woman, I could come out the other end as the strongest one he'd ever met.

Option one was instant gratification and so appealing. Option two would take time and dedication and couldn't be executed overnight. Continuing with the Errand would mean working two of the most difficult and intricate Errands of my career. Option two could also mean death. The man grinning at me had made it clear he had no qualms about beating me close to death, and I didn't doubt he'd finish where he'd left off if he deemed me stepping out of line again.

It was dangerous. It was daunting. It was like playing a game of tug-of-war with death.

It was everything I was cut out for.

"Thank you, Mr. Tucker," I said softly, sweetly. I matched my smile to my tone. "Thank you for showing me what my role is."

And thank you for reminding me that my role is to not rest until you have been totally and irreversibly f**ked over in every way a man like you can be.

"You're my girl now." He grabbed my hand, and I couldn't help but compare the difference between his and Henry's touch. They were like night and day. "I'll take care of you if you take care of me."

I kept my smirk to myself and glanced at him, keeping my fake smile in place. "I'll take care of you, Mr. Tucker. Guaranteed."
