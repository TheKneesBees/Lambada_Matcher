Cordova jumped at the loud, insistent knock at her door, nearly dropping the brush she'd been running through her long curtain of black hair. Setting it carefully on the vanity, she rose from her chair. She thought briefly about taking a moment to tuck her hair underneath her cap, but she knew that if it were her employer she would be scolded for keeping her waiting so she dutifully rushed out.

Taking a deep breath, she crossed the room and opened the door to see Lady Alice Grey, lady-in-waiting to King Lyon and her employer, waiting, flanked by two royal guards. Cordova's eyes immediately jumped to the envelope fisted in the Lady's skeletally thin hand, and her heart hammered against her chest.

"How may I be of service, my Lady?" she asked, struggling to keep her voice steady. She started to bow, but her head snapped back as Lady Grey's free hand shot out, cracking against her face.

"You stupid wench," she snapped, black eyes cold in contrast to the spots of color in her bony cheeks. "Did you really think you could get away with this?"

"I-I-I don't know what you mean," Cordova stammered, clutching her stinging cheek even as her eyes darted back to the envelope. She knew very well what the Lady meant, but that didn't mean she was going to give in right away. Even if she couldn't see a way out of this predicament.

Lady Grey ripped the letter out of the envelope and waved it in front of her face. "One of my secretaries intercepted this letter yesterday. In it you write of unspeakable accusations against the King-outlandish tales of high taxes, poverty, unfair justice systems."

Cordova lifted her chin. "They are not outlandish tales. The King overtaxes his people, fattens the rich and starves the poor, and beheads or imprisons anyone who dares to question his command. He is nothing more than a barbarian and a tyrant."

One of the guards stepped up, a pair of heavy manacles hanging loosely in his hands. "Such accusations are treasonous, Miss Thomas, and will not be tolerated by King Lyon or the people of Margon. You're going to have to come with us."

A tremor of fear rippled through her, and she felt her legs suddenly weaken, barely able to hold her up. "What are you going to do with me? Will you behead me like the others?" she accused even as she allowed the guard to secure the manacles around her wrists.

The guard met her gaze steadily, and Cordova saw no mercy in his eyes. "That will be for the King to decide."

****

King Lyon tapped his fingers restlessly on the arm of his throne as he watched his latest subject be escorted from the throne room in heavy chains. His heart had long been hardened against his people's pleas for mercy. They should know by now that he rarely had any to spare, and to stay out of trouble. If they dared to step over the lines that had been crossed for them, they knew the punishment he would swiftly mete out.

In truth, he actually detested killing his own people, but he did not gain all that he had by ruling from the teat. A heavy hand would teach the people of Margon to refrain from questioning his rule. He had learned from his father that a King is better feared, than loved.

"Send in the next accused," he drawled, bored by the monotony. He understood the necessity of holding these courts-those who stepped over the line had to be punished, after all-but it was all so very tedious. He would much rather be in the war room with his strategists, or out in the fields engaging in sport. Or perhaps between the sheets with a willing woman. His lips curled at the thought. He desperately needed a new mistress. Someone who could entertain him, and give him some much-needed relief. He certainly had his share of women and even those who secretly opposed being bedded would never dare to deny him. Perhaps he would choose one this afternoon.

The guards brought in a woman, and Lyon blinked, before sitting up straight to get a better look at her. She wore a shapeless gray dress that draped loosely on her thin frame, and her head hung forward so that her curtain of black hair concealed her face. As she was brought before the throne, Lyon noticed that her entire body was trembling, and couldn't quite hide a disgusted sneer. So, they had brought him a mouse. Well, he would hear her crimes and then chew her up and spit her out like all the others.

"Your Majesty," his attendant greeted him, belly jiggling most unbecomingly as he turned to face the King. "The accused is Miss Cordova Thomas, companion to Lady Alice Grey. She comes before you accused of high treason-a letter she wrote to her family was intercepted, and contained slander and blasphemous things written about your Majesty."

"I see." Lyon turned his attention to the woman, curious rather than infuriated, as he ought to be. "And what say you to these accusations, Miss Thomas?"

The woman tossed her hair out of her face, raising a pointed chin so she could glare daggers at him with her garnet eyes. "If speaking the truth...if warning my family not to come here in order to spare them your tyranny, is considered to be high treason, then yes, I am guilty."

Lyon arched a brow, sucking in a sharp breath as the exquisite beauty of her features hit him, full force. Her heart-shaped face was pale but for the spots of color on her cheeks, her black eyebrows were drawn tightly over piercing eyes that sparkled with fury, and her lips, the color of ripe strawberries, were compressed into a tight, thin line. She looked like a war goddess, or perhaps a Valkyrie, ready to rise up and strike him down with a vengeance should she be given the chance. He knew instinctively that the body beneath that gown would be just as exquisite, and was struck by an overwhelming desire to whip the offending cloth away so he could see for himself.

Cordova stood her ground, holding her head high as she proudly defied the King, but inside she was confused in a wash of unyielding emotion. Rather than flying into a rage and ordering her immediate beheading as she'd rather expected, he simply stared, his eyes roving over her face, his blue eyes scalding her with a hunger she didn't understand. Her body reacted, chills running down her spine, n**ples stiffening, which only confused her more. She couldn't help but notice that he was an attractive man-his powerfully built body shown off by the embroidered doublet and hose he wore over his linen shirt. His reddish-blond hair curled thickly atop his head, his handsome face framed with a square jaw dusted with a day's growth of beard. His lips were firm, sensual, and curved into... a smile? She shivered. What sort of hideous punishment could he be thinking of for him to smile like that?

"How dare you speak to the King that way!" the advisor sputtered after a long silence in which his beady eyes darted back and forth between the two. "You should show more respect to the King who so graciously allows you to live at his court!"

Cordova sneered at him, recklessly bold-there was no going back after all; she was doomed regardless of whether or not she remained silent. "Don't patronize me. I doubt the good King even knew I existed before you brought me to his attention."

"You have an unusually sharp tongue," the King remarked before his clearly affronted advisor could respond. "You do know that with every traitorous word you speak, I can add to your punishment? That rather than order a simple beheading, I could have you tortured for days, weeks, months? That I could have you begging for your life...or perhaps, your death?"

Cordova felt the blood leech from her face at the thought of prolonged torture. Still, she refused to back down. "I won't beg you for anything," she vowed, nearly spitting out the words.

His eyes gleamed, the challenge accepted. "Oh, I think you will," he said silkily-oh, did he want her to beg, he thought as he watched the rapid rise and fall of her bosom. Not for death, but for him-his touch, his mouth, his shaft as it pumped deep inside of her. "I admire your spirit, woman. Not many men have dared to challenge me in this way, and certainly never a woman."

He turned to his advisor. "Leave us. I want everyone from this room gone except for my personal guard."

The advisor frowned. "Your majesty?"

"Did you not hear me?" Lyon arched a brow.

The man blanched. "Yes, your Majesty...as you wish." He scrambled down from the dais and ushered the nobles from the room, leaving reluctantly, a flurry of whispers exchanged behind the hands raised to their mouths. Let them speculate, Lyon thought.

His lips curved as Cordova watched him warily. "Don't think I will not punish you, Miss Thomas," he warned, and she stiffened. "You will serve me in repentance for your crimes-in my bed."

"I beg your pardon?" Cordova whispered, faintly.

Lyon's grin widened at her distress. "Don't sound so upset, Ms. Thomas. Being a King's mistress is considered an honor. Be grateful."

****

Be grateful!

Cordova fumed, pacing back and forth in the drawing room as she had done for the past four hours, waiting for him. The guards had taken her to a private suite of rooms connected to the King's quarters by a secret tunnel and told her that she had free reign of the space, and could do anything she wished as long as she didn't leave. Since the only way out was through the tunnel and a twenty-four hour guard had been posted there, escape was highly unlikely. There wasn't even a single window for her to look out of. She felt suffocated, closed in.

She couldn't believe this was happening. Why, oh why hadn't she just kept her thoughts to herself? How could she have been so stupid as to think her letters wouldn't be intercepted? She was not of royal blood, after all, and the King was always on the lookout for spies.

You're lucky you weren't tortured and beheaded, like he'd suggested would be appropriate for your behavior.

Sighing, she lowered herself onto the settee, pushing aside the pale pink cushions so she could stretch out and think. He was right to tell her that she should be grateful-at least for sparing her life. But she was still furious. Even though he was enshrouding her in secrecy, that no one aside from a select number of guards would know about what she would be forced to do, she would still know on the inside that she was ruined. Once she returned home, she would never be able to marry a man, for she could not deceive one, and who would want to marry a King's mistress, spoiled and used? It didn't matter that she would spread her legs between silk sheets instead of a crumbling doorway. She would still be nothing more than a whore.

Her eyes drifted closed, then opened as she heard the faint sounds of a man's footfalls against soft carpet. Turning her head, she watched King Lyon enter the drawing room, still dressed in the same clothing he'd worn at her 'trial'. He caught sight of her and paused, standing in the middle of the room, dominating it with his powerful, imposing frame. She swallowed hard, her heart thumping loudly in her ears. Why did he make her blood heat so? He was a pompous, arrogant tyrant.

Frowning, his eyes raked her form. "You did not choose one of the dresses in the wardrobe provided for you?"

Cordova's cheeks colored as she rose. "I see no need to subject myself to the garish fashions of court any moment sooner than I have to. Unlike the ladies of your court who think nothing of baring their bosoms to get what they want, I am a modest woman."

King Lyon laughed. "You are provided with a King's ransom of clothing that the women of my court would swoon over, and you call them garish?"

Cordova bit her lower lip, unsure if she had upset him or not. "I don't mean to sound ungrateful, your Majesty," she amended, trying for a less petulant approach. It wouldn't do to make her life more difficult than it was already going to be. "But I simply can't bring myself to wear those fashions."

The King lifted an eyebrow. "They are what you have been provided with, and until you have earned the right to ask for more, you will wear them. Either that, or you can go nak*d."

Cordova gasped, her cheeks coloring. "I beg your pardon?"

King Lyon grinned. "Now that I think of it, I may just order you to forgo clothes completely. After all, you are all alone down here, so no one other than I will be able to see you. And it would be so much more convenient for me."

Cordova's flush deepened, rage joining her mortification. "I refuse."

"Suit yourself." Lyon stepped forward, closing the distance between them, and Cordova felt her skin tingle in anticipation. "In any case, your garments offend me. It's time we take them off."

"W-what?" Now?

Lyon's eyes sparked hungrily, and her entire body heated. "I'm not the type of man who is content with tossing up a woman's skirts and taking his pleasure. I want to see your body. All of it."

"Yes," she breathed, her cheeks heating again. It sounded as though she were agreeing with him rather than simply acknowledging him. Her fingers trembled as she lifted them to the row of buttons trailing down her front, and she fumbled, trying to loosen them.

"I..." her breathing hitched. "I cannot." She'd never stripped in front of a man before, and King Lyon's hot gaze made it impossible for her to concentrate.

Lyon softened at the panic in her eyes and the stiffness in her spine. "Let me help you," he murmured huskily, brushing her hands away so he could undo the buttons himself. He could practically feel the innocence rolling off her in waves. It had been awhile since had last taken a virgin. He was going to have to be gentle, this first time.

Popping the last button, he released his hands and let the dress pool around her ankles, then sucked in a breath as he studied her. Clad only in a thin chemise, her curves were exposed to his gaze, and they were even lusher than he'd expected. Her br**sts were ripe melons, the n**ples straining against the thin, white material. Her waist was tiny, her h*ps flared-a body made for childbearing. Her calves looked silky, her ankles dainty and graceful.

"You're beautiful," he whispered hoarsely, running his large, callused palms up and down her bare arms.

Cordova shivered, leaning into the King's warm hands-not that she was cold. Far from it. She was sure that if she looked down her entire skin would be pink from the heat coursing through her body. But her eyes were riveted to King Lyon's gaze-dark, hungry, commanding.

"Why are you doing this?" she murmured, trembling all over from the chills his touch incited. "Why do you choose to spare me?"

"Because I can," he retorted harshly, yanking her against his big, hard body. His lips crashed down to claim hers, and Cordova moaned-she couldn't help it. Her body loved the proximity between them, craved it, wanted more. Her n**ples tingled as they scraped against his doublet, and moisture pooled between her thighs.

Lyon plundered her mouth with his tongue, dominating her utterly as he reveled in her sweetness. He loved the little sound she made when he'd pulled her against him-soft and passionate, just like her body felt against him. Without breaking the kiss he swung her up into his arms and carried her to the bedroom, where he set her upon the large bed that dominated the room.

Stepping back, he took a moment to study her again, admiring the way her chemise contrasted against the gilt and garnet coverlet. Her green eyes were smoky with desire, her cheeks flushed, her heavy bosom heaving, n**ples straining against the material of her undergarment.

"Your Majesty?" she asked hesitantly, unsure as to what he wanted from her. From the stories she heard, men tended to fall on their mistresses like slavering dogs, taking their pleasure and then moving on with their business. But the King spent an awfully long time just simply looking at her, as though she were a feast he was about to savor.

"This needs to come off," he growled, tugging her shoulders so that she rose up. His fingers curled around the straps of her chemise, and then it was pulled over her head and tossed aside, to flutter to the floor like a butterfly wing.

"Oh, yes," he murmured, drinking in her creamy, nak*d flesh with his eyes. Her ran his hands down her sides, enjoying the feel of her smooth, unmarred skin, and the way her curves fit so perfectly into his palms. She arched into his touch, offering her dusky rose n**ples to him, and he took greedily, cupping her br**sts before leaning down and suckling gently on her right one.

"Oh!" A cry flew from Cordova's lips, filled with surprise and pleasure. Exquisite sensation rippled through her with each suck, each tug, as he pleasured her n**ples with his mouth and hands. His teeth nipped, his tongue licked, his fingers pinched and rolled, until she was wrapping her legs around his waist and rubbing her core shamelessly against his erection, mindlessly seeking relief.

Lyon groaned at the feel of Cordova's warm center rubbing along the length of his shaft-the pleasure was incredible, and he hadn't even removed his clothes yet. How much more pleasurable would it be to rub himself against her bare flesh? To sink his shaft deep inside her?

Impatient, he pulled back and yanked at the buttons of his doublet. In short order it joined the chemise on the floor along with the linen shirt he wore underneath. Cordova caught her breath as she watched him stand-his chest muscles rippled in the candlelight, dusted lightly with curls the same color as the hair atop his head. He kicked off his boots, and then tore off his hose, freeing his shaft, and she gasped.

Lyon chuckled at the shock in his new mistress's eyes. "Have you never seen one before?" he asked, boldly curling his fingers around the hard length.

Cordova gulped as her pulse kicked up a notch-she should have found such an action lewd, but instead she wanted to knock his hand aside and replace it with her fingers. "I... you're just so large."

"Don't worry," Lyon assured her as he returned to the bed. "I will fit." Crouching before her, he slid his hands underneath the backs of her thighs and drew her knees up before spreading her legs. "Beautiful," he murmured again, staring at the glistening pink folds between her legs, crowned with a thatch of silky black curls. He ran his fingers through them, then down her nether lips, coating them in her moisture. She was wet already, so wet.

Cordova whimpered, arching her h*ps against his hand. With each brush of his fingers, pleasure stabbed, and she wanted more of it. His fingers tunneled through her folds, and she cried out as he hit a spot that sent arcs of pleasure shooting through her.

Lyon grinned as her head fell back on the mattress, and continued to stimulate the little nub, rubbing it back and forth between his fingers until she was bucking mindlessly against his hand.

"Oh, oh, oh!" she screamed as something inside her burst, following by crushing waves of pleasure that wiped her mind of all thought. It was good. So, so, good. She'd never experienced anything like this before.

Lyon rose up and positioned his shaft near Cordova's entrance, the mushroom tip rubbing gently at the folds, coating him in her creamy wetness. He pushed in while she was still in the throes of her orgasm, tearing through her hymen, which provided minimal resistance. Cordova stiffened, uttering a low moan, and he went utterly still. When he felt her relax, he eased into her slowly.

"By the Gods," he gasped. "You're so tight." Her inner walls gave inch by inch, stretching and wrapping around him as they frantically worked to accommodate his size. Torture, sweet, sweet torture.

Cordova gasped as he finally filled her to the hilt, squirming slightly as she became accustomed to the feel of having a man inside her. She... liked it, she decided. Liked the way his thick, hard shaft felt, filling her up, pulsing hungrily inside her.

"I... I am alright," she whispered.

"Good," he rumbled, leaning down and burying his face in the crook of her neck in a surprisingly tender move. His tongue darted out to flick across the pulse hammering at her throat, and she shivered, a tiny little moan slipping past her lips. "Mmm. You taste good, woman."

Gradually, he began to move inside her, working up a steady rhythm. Cordova dug her fingernails into the coverlet as he worked his shaft inside her, gasping with each wonderful, pleasure-filled stroke. King Lyon hauled her legs up so she could wrap them around his waist, and then dug his fingers into her h*ps so he could control the pace. He looked magnificent, like a warrior, muscular and golden, his eyes hot as he stared down at her, h*ps pumping.

Soon, the languorous pace was not enough, and Cordova began moving her h*ps frantically, trying to get him to increase the speed. He refused at first, but when, out of desperate inspiration, she reached between them and cupped his sac in her hand he relented with a groan. Sliding his hands from her hips, he gripped each of her buttocks and lifted, then pounded into her for all he was worth.

"Gods," he muttered hoarsely. "Good. So good." He knew he wasn't going to last very long at this pace and so reached down, thumbing that sweet spot between her legs as he continued to slam his shaft inside her. He felt her stiffen, then scream as the orgasm washed through her and pulled out, spilling his seed across her belly. Spent, he collapsed on the bed next to her, breathing heavily.

Exhausted from lovemaking and a long, stressful day, Cordova slipped into sleep.

****

When Cordova woke, King Lyon was gone. He'd tucked a blanket around her, but she still shivered-she did not sleep nak*d, and was not used to the lack of layers.

Standing, she wrapped the blanket around her and walked out of the bedroom and into the drawing room, where she remembered seeing a clock. Sure enough, one rested on the mantle, and she found that it was morning, though she would never have known otherwise since there were no windows in her quarters.

Fire crackled in the hearth, and she wondered who had come to light it while she'd been sleeping. She wandered into the bathing room and found a large tub filled with fragrant, steaming water. Lowering herself into it, she sighed as the warm water soothed her sore muscles and tiny aches, enveloping her with delicious comfort. She grabbed the washcloth and bar of soap and began to clean herself off.

"Did you sleep well, Miss Thomas?"

She jumped, swiveling her head toward the sound of King Lyon's voice, and saw him standing in the doorway. He looked regal and magnificent, dressed in blue and gold and white, his bearing erect and proud. A flush washed over her cheeks-she told herself it was ridiculous to be self-conscious as he'd already seen her nak*d last night, but she couldn't help herself.

"I did, your Majesty." She inclined her head, unwilling to leave the comfort of the water for a more formal greeting-in any case; it was impossible to curtsey without a skirt to hold.

Her jaw dropped as he stripped off his clothing, revealing his body to her once more. "I brought you a present," he said, approaching with a small drawstring bag.

"W-what are you doing?" she asked as he stepped into the tub.

He arched a brow. "Joining you, of course. Is there a problem?"

"No." She mustn't complain. He was being fairly lenient with her, after all.

"Good." He pulled open the drawstring bag and upended it, pouring a stream of crystals into the water-bathing salts, she realized. The scent of jasmine filled the air, and she sighed. Bathing salts were a luxury she had never been able to afford.

She barely protested when he took the washcloth and soap from her hands and took over the job of cleaning her. His hands were gentle as he ran the soapy cloth over her back, shoulders, arms, and she shivered as he lathered her br**sts. The washcloth moved down her abdomen, then between her thighs, and she whimpered.

"Does that feel good?" he murmured in her ear, replacing the washcloth with his fingers.

"Oh, yes," she breathed, gripping his bare shoulders as her head fell back.

He traced the shell of her ear with his tongue. "Do you want more?"

"I..." she had promised herself not to beg him. "If you so desire."

Chuckling, he pushed a long finger inside her, and she cried out in shock and pleasure. "I will make you beg, Miss Thomas."

Cordova gasped as he slowly worked his finger in and out, in and out. She would not beg. She would not.

He shrugged. "Don't fight it," he mocked, inserting another finger and coercing another cry from her. She bucked her hips, trying to grind herself against his fingers, but he gripped her h*ps tightly with his free hand, having none of it. Inserting another finger, he stretched her fully, but kept up his slow, torturous pace until she was trembling all over, tears threatening.

"Is something wrong?" he asked innocently, nibbling at her jawline.

"N-no..." Cordova stammered, then bit her lip to keep from crying out as he flicked his thumb across her sweet spot, lightning fast.

"You are sure?" he asked, lips twitching. "There is not anything you... need?"

"I..." she gasped as he ducked his head and swirled his tongue around her left nipple, tonguing the areola. "No. Nothing." Her h*ps bucked instinctively as he flicked his thumb across the nub between her legs again, bellying her words, and he laughed.

"Rest assured, woman, I could do this all day." It was perfectly true. He loved to watch her face-it was so open, expressive, and currently flushed with passion. "If you want release, you will have to tell me what you want."

Cordova bit down on her lower lip to keep another moan from escaping as he continued to torture her with his fingers. She knew he wasn't going to let her go, but surely he couldn't let this go on forever. He would take pity on her. He had to.

"Well, if there's nothing you need, I suppose I will just be on my way." He started to withdraw his fingers, and arched his brow when her hand shot out to grip his wrist.

"Please," she panted. "Don't leave me like this."

"Like what?" he asked. "I thought you were fine."

She wanted to scream in frustration. "You know I'm not."

"Then what is it you want?" he brushed his fingers gently against her folds, and her h*ps bucked.

"I want..." She swallowed. "I want you inside me."

"Hmm." He shifted to bring his shaft into contact with her core, and she moaned. "Do you now?"

"Yes!" she sobbed as he rubbed the head of his c*ck back and forth across her entrance. "Please! I... please!"

"You had but to ask," he assured her, surging inside her with one smooth thrust, and they moaned simultaneously. Gripping her hips, he lifted her up, and then slammed her back down onto his shaft, repeating the motion over and over again, sending arcs of pleasure racing through both of them. Her br**sts bounced wildly as she mewled her pleasure and he caught a nipple between his teeth, nipping and suckling the taut, rosy bud. Gods, she tasted sweet. And those curves... he gripped her bottom in his hands, kneading the flesh with his fingers.

Cordova didn't think it was possible, but the pleasure was even greater than it had been last time. Every time his shaft moved inside her it brushed against that sweet spot, heightening the pleasure further. Planting her knees firmly onto the bottom of the tub she rode him, undulating her h*ps to match his pace, delighted when his eyes darkened and another deep groan rumbled up from his chest. The orgasm slammed into her suddenly, sweeping her away so that she saw a blanket of stars, and her screams echoed off the walls.

"Cordova!" Lyon shouted as he spurt his seed, this time inside her. Gods, he'd meant to pull out, but she felt so good that he couldn't bring himself to leave her body. She slumped on top of him and he cradled her head against his chest.

Cordova curled into his lap, content to listen to his heartbeat gradually slowing. She knew they couldn't stay this way forever-the water would cool eventually-but she didn't want him to leave just yet. He was her only company, after all.

"I chose to make you my mistress because I like your honesty."

"What?" she looked up at him. Where had this come from?

"You asked me why I spared you yesterday." He arched his brows. "The majority of the ladies at court are greedy, conniving creatures-they will do anything to get into my bed because they want the wealth I can provide them should I choose, and the prestige of having lain with the King. But you dared to speak what was on your mind, regardless of the consequences, and I find that refreshing." He stroked her cheek gently. "And despite that hideous dress you were brought before me wearing, I could already see that none of those women could hold a candle to your beauty. You are exquisite."

"I still think you are a tyrant," she reminded him, doing the best to ignore the flush of pleasure his words caused. "No amount of flattering is going to change that."

His eyes cooled, the tenderness leaving them. "That is your choice." He stood, water sluicing off his body, and stepped from the tub. "Just remember that you would do well to remind yourself that you are still at my mercy. And that for as long as I choose to keep you, your body is mine to do with as I wish."

Cordova watched him leave, barely refraining from heaving the bar of soap at him. She wanted to cry in frustration at the hand that fate dealt her, but she would not. Be strong, she reminded herself. Strong women did not cry at the drop of a hat.

****

The King did not return, and Cordova spent the rest of the day in peaceful, if not lonely solitude. She'd donned her grey dress again, both in defiance of the King and because she was not yet willing to try on any of the fine clothes in her new wardrobe, no matter how soft and wonderful the material looked and felt. The suite had a pantry of sorts, and she'd helped herself to the dried meats and fruit within.

Aside from the guard who came to deliver her luncheon and supper, she saw no one. The drawing room had a piano, and so after supper she spent a long while relearning the keys and practicing the pieces she'd learned in childhood. Her parents had never been able to afford a piano or a tutor, but an elderly neighbor who'd owned one had taught her a few things in her spare time.

The music relaxed her, so that she did not notice the King had entered the drawing room and now stood in the doorway, leaning against the doorjamb as he watched her play. Her hands flew over the keys with the same depth of precision that another woman's might handle a loom-the difference being that one wove threads, while the other wove sounds into a tapestry of delight.

He stood there for a long time, simply content to listen to her play-which surprised him. After all, he'd only come down for a quick tumble, to relieve some of his pent up frustration that the day's proceedings had left him with. He knew she didn't like him, didn't approve of his ways, and since he wasn't going to try and change that there was no point in cultivating a real relationship.

Yet there he stood, making no move to interrupt her, simply enjoying her as she was.

Cordova's hands stilled as she finished the piece, and then stiffened when she heard someone clapping. Turning slowly, she saw King Lyon, and a flush crept over her face that wasn't entirely due to embarrassment.

"How long have you been standing there?" she demanded, forgetting that she'd decided to subdue herself so as not to get into any more trouble.

"Long enough to know that with proper training, you could be an extraordinary pianist." He smiled, the expression at odds with the hungry look in his eyes. Did he always have to look at her in quite that way? Didn't it know that it turned her brains to mush, her knees to jelly?

"Be that as it may, it is very rude to intrude unannounced. Surely you knew I was not expecting an audience."

"I don't recall the necessity of asking your permission," the King replied smoothly, and there was annoyance in his eyes now. He crossed the distance between them and Cordova stiffened further, unsure as to his intentions. She was surprised when, rather than kissing her or laying a hand on her as his behavior suggested he wanted to do, he sat down beside her on the piano bench.

"Play something," he demanded.

Cordova sucked in a breath. She wanted to retort, but found his proximity robbed her of speech-his powerful thigh muscles brushed against hers, inciting more shivers along with a quivering in her womb. Knowing it would be unwise to refuse, she flexed her fingers to stop their trembling, then placed her hands on the keys and allowed the first melody that came to mind to flow through her fingers-a ballad.

She nearly missed a note when the King began to sing, and had to make a conscious effort to keep her eyes focused on the keys instead of turning to look at him like she so desperately wanted. His voice was wonderful, rich and flowing and masculine, like sound spun into heavy silk. What surprised her most was that he knew the lyrics; it was a song about forgiveness, passion, and tender words between lovers. To be able to sing it with such a depth of emotion indicated that he empathized, even understood, and that was not something she expected. Or could easily accept.

When the last strains of the melody faded away, she forced herself to meet his gaze. "You have a lovely voice."

His eyes were intent on hers; unreadable. "Taking the frown on your face into consideration, I am not sure that I believe you."

Cordova hesitated. "I just never..."

"... Thought that I sang? I am not surprised, Miss. Thomas." He laughed bitterly. "To you I am just a lout, a petty tyrant who revels in war and suffering. Of course in your mind it shouldn't be possible for me to have an appreciation for the finer, more delicate things in life. And I shouldn't, not when my grandfather worked so hard to beat it out of me at such a young age."

"I'm sorry..." An image of him being caned by his grandfather flashed through her mind, and she shook her head. Oh no. She was not going to let him cultivate sympathy for him inside her heart. He could easily be spinning a tale-though for what purpose, she did not know. Still, his words tugged at her heartstrings despite her cynical mind.

"Never mind." He circled his arms around her waist, pulling her flush against him. "I did not come down here to speak of a distant past. I came here for you."

Heart pounding, Cordova tilted her head up to meet his lips at the same time King Lyon bent his head. She fisted her hands in his doublet as his tongue slid sensually against hers, stoking the embers smoldering in her womb into a full-fledged flame, and moaned into his mouth.

Reaching out with one hand, Lyon pulled the wooden cover over the piano keys, then stood and placed Cordova on top of it so that her h*ps were level with his. His shaft was already aching, and he rucked up her dress around her h*ps so he could press his thickness against her core, still kissing her.

Cordova moaned as the King began to grind himself against her, pressing up hard against her sweet spot. He thrust his tongue in and out of her mouth in rhythm with his hips; a prelude to what she wanted him to do to her. How was it possible that such a strong desire could overtake her body so quickly, so furiously? Whimpering, she buried her fingers in his curly mass of hair, rubbing herself shamelessly against him until she was crying out in pleasure, trembling as an orgasm swept through her.

Lyon pulled away, and Cordova was surprised when he knelt before her instead of pushing down his hose and thrusting inside her like she thought he would. He spread her legs wide, his hungry gaze fixed on the most private part of her body.

"Oh, your Majesty," she gasped, realizing his intentions. He was going to lick her there? "You can't!"

"Oh, but I can," he growled, leaning in, and Cordova screamed as he ran his tongue over her center. "Mmm. You taste so sweet." He licked her again, his tongue burrowing through her silky folds until he found that secret spot. Cordova's h*ps bucked, and he gripped them with his large hands, forcing her to take what he gave her, when he gave it to her. His tongue flicked and circled, alternating the pressure so that he forced her to the edge, and then backed off. Her knees clamped tight around his head, her nails dug painfully into his scalp, and he didn't care. It was worth it, to hear her shrieks as he gorged himself on her scent and taste.

"Please!" she finally cried. "Please, please, Lyon!"

He liked the sound of his name on her lips, even if she'd forgotten his title. As a reward for pleasing him, he sucked hard on her pleasure nub, and smiled as she stiffened around his head, screaming her release. He lapped up the sweet cream that gushed out of her until she was limp.

"That was," she gasped, not caring that she sounded desperately inexperienced. "I have no words."

Lyon smiled. "You need none." He pushed his hose down, hooked Cordova's ankles around his shoulders, and plunged inside her. They gasped simultaneously, and then Lyon began thrusting, not nearly as gentle as he'd been before. He could feel her inner walls gripping his shaft tightly, trying to hold him as he moved inside her, creating the most delicious friction between them.

Cordova's nails dug into the wood beneath her, her long hair spread out across the piano, her head tilted back to expose the white column of her throat. She was utterly helpless in this position, and could do nothing but lie back and let him pound his shaft into her.

No, that wasn't true. Lifting her head, she slid her hand down to where they were joined and made a "V" with her middle and forefingers over her softness so she could feel his shaft sliding against her fingers as he worked it inside of her. Watching the hard length of him move in and out, in and out, was one of the most erotic things she'd ever seen. She circled her fingers around him lightly, enjoying the feel of his hot, hard shaft pulsing wetly against her palm.

Lyon groaned at the feel of her hand around him, and knew he needed more. Pulling out, he gripped Cordova by the h*ps and pulled her off the piano, then pushed her to her knees.

Eyes impossibly wide, Cordova stared at his glistening shaft, which bobbed hungrily in front of her face. "What am I to do?"

Lyon's fingers threaded through her hair. "Take it," he commanded, pushing his h*ps toward her. "In your mouth."

Cordova swallowed nervously, licking her lips as she gripped the base of his shaft with her hand. He was so big. Would he be able to fit in her mouth? She'd heard rumors about men demanding this sort of thing from their women, and all of the stories had sounded so very distasteful.

But he had knelt between her legs and given her pleasure, so it seemed only fair that she return the favor. Not that she had a choice in the matter. She was his mistress, fated to do all that pleased him.

A drop of seed glistened at the slit, and Cordova licked the mushroom head, tasting his creamy saltiness. She smiled as he gave a full-body shudder, realizing suddenly that she held an enormous amount of power in her hand. She could make him beg just as he had made her do so.

She licked the underside of his shaft, dragging her tongue from base to tip, then swirling it around the mushroom head. His fingers tightened in her hair, urging her forward, but she resisted, continuing to tongue him relentlessly without actually taking him into her mouth.

"Woman," Lyon finally growled. "If you don't cease this torment, I will pull you over my knee and spank you."

The image those words conjured was evocative rather than threatening, and Cordova had to fight back a giggle at the note of desperation in his voice. He didn't quite beg, but then he was the King. She would take what she could get.

Smiling, she gave one last lick to the head, and then slid him into her mouth whole. Lyon's deep groan was so filled with lust that she shivered involuntarily. His shaft pulsed hotly inside her mouth, and she began sucking, dragging her lips up and down his full length, delighting in the flavor of not only him, but herself.

"Gods, yes." Lyon fisted her long, dark hair as he watched her suck his shaft hungrily. He was riveted by her jewel-bright eyes that watched him with a mixture of amusement and desire as she worked her tongue, lips and teeth on him. Soon he was gripping her temples and pumping his hips, thrusting into her mouth. She took him without complaint, fondling his sac with one hand as she pleasured him, and soon he was shouting her name, spewing his hot seed into her mouth.

Cordova swallowed every last drop, then sat back on her heels and wiped her lips from her fingertips. The look of pure rapture on the King's face swelled her with desire. She'd never thought to feel so smug or accomplished about bringing a man to such pleasure. Was this why mistresses were so willing to lie between the sheets with a man they could not marry? No, surely not. Some of the men she'd seen at court were homely as sin- they had nothing to offer a woman besides their vast coffers.

"For a virgin," Lyon said as he pulled his hose up. "You are remarkably skilled."

Cordova lifted a shoulder. "When one lives in the country, the innocence of the mind is quickly lost. I have heard enough about the act to get an idea of how it is done."

Lyon chuckled. "Such a... clinical way of putting it. Were you not writhing in my arms a scant few minutes ago, begging for me to give you release?"

Cordova blushed, and said nothing, rising to her feet and smoothing her dress around her hips, obscuring her lovely body once again. He frowned.

"Will you really refuse the garments I have provided you?" he inquired. "I really do loathe that dress."

Cordova lifted a shoulder. "I might consider wearing them... under one condition."

Lyon raised a brow. "And that would be?" Normally he wouldn't consider her demands, but he was in good spirits just now.

"I... there is not very much to do here," Cordova admitted. "I should like some books to read, or some cloth and a needle and thread to embroider with. Anything to alleviate the tedium during your absences.

The King frowned. He certainly did not want her to be idle-unoccupied women could become dangerous. "I will arrange something for you."

The next morning, after Cordova had dressed and broken her fast, she entered the drawing room to discover a pleasant surprise-an entire shelf had been installed next to the piano, crammed full of books. Her heart swelled with joy as she rushed over to inspect them-there was some of everything, from philosophical texts to encyclopedias to poetry.

"Oh, this is wonderful," she breathed, pulling out a leather bound with gilded pages. She took several books from the shelf and brought them with her to the settee, where she was greeted by another surprise-a large, cloth bag. Setting the books aside, she pulled out balls of yarn, spools of thread, cloth, and needles.

"How generous," she murmured, running her hands over a particularly vibrant ball of yarn-the green was the exact shade of her eyes. The King hadn't made any excuses when she'd hurled her accusations at him, but his behavior belied them all the same. She hadn't expected him to be so... tender? She wasn't sure that was the right word. But he was certainly being very kind to her considering that this was supposed to be her punishment. When he'd first declared that she was to be his mistress, she'd envisioned being locked away in some dark chamber, perhaps even chained and at his mercy. But although she was locked away, her chambers were spacious, and she was allowed to live in comfort.

And she didn't have to deal with the obnoxious Lady Grey anymore. Oh, what a boon this was turning out to be!

Weeks passed, in which King Lyon made love to her regularly, saturating her life with pleasure. Often she would spend the waning hours of the afternoon in a state of lustful anticipation, awaiting his arrival. He had become an addiction to her-she loved the feel of his hands and mouth on her, the way his calluses scraped against her smooth skin, his husky groans of pleasure.

Even more, he made her feel cherished. Oh, there were no words of love from him, and she expected none. But he lavished her with gifts-a jeweled comb here, a ruby necklace there, a gilt rose. He still refused to provide her with a more modest wardrobe, but she'd grown used to wearing the low-cut, form fitting gowns. It wasn't as though anyone else ever saw her, and the hot, hungry look that fired his eyes when they alighted on her cl**vage was worth it. She loved it when he looked at her like that.

Nevertheless, she still missed her family. Often she would wake in the middle of the night after having a particularly lovely dream about them, and the reality of her situation would crash down upon her shoulders. She couldn't stop the tears from coming during those times, and it was worse if Lyon happened to be abed with her. He would offer her wordless comfort, never once asking as to what troubled her, and it was awful because she both cared for him and despised him for keeping her from those she loved most.

Lyon knew all this, of course, and every day that passed the guilt grew stronger within him. For he had come to care for her deeply as well, and it was not easy for him to see her suffer. He'd intercepted a letter from her mother, and upon opening it was surprised at the warmth in the greeting-the words were infused with love and gratitude, certainly nothing he'd ever received from his grandfather. And there had been no hint of deception, no evidence to suggest that either of them were plotting against the Crown. It was petty of him to continue to hold her, and though he was no stranger to committing petty acts, this one nagged at his conscious.

He came to her that afternoon, bearing a manila envelope.

"What is that?" Cordova asked, frowning uneasily. She disliked the melancholy look in his eyes.

Lyon handed it to her. "See for yourself."

Cordova opened the envelope and carefully unfolded the letter. Her jaw dropped as she scanned the contents-it was a proclamation declaring her cleared of all charges and released from her sentence.

"You..." she lifted her shocked gaze to him. What could she say to this, when she wasn't sure herself as to how she felt about it?

Lyon shrugged. "You are released from your service to me. I know you have been wishing to return to your family."

She should be ecstatic but with a torrent of emotions swirling inside of her heart, she could barely find the words. "I don't know what to say."

Lyon arched a brow, a hint of a smile on his face. But his eyes, blank of all emotion, told the true story. He didn't care one way or the other if she left him. "You'd best get ready."

He started to turn away, and Cordova called out, "You seem very sure that I've made up my mind to go."

Lyon whirled back, dark emotion swirling in his eyes. "You would choose a life with me, knowing that we could never marry, and that any children you bore with me would be bastards, over the constant and unchanging love of your family?"

Cordova's lips moved, but no words came out, and the King laughed bitterly. "Don't raise my hopes with false promises, Miss Thomas. I'll provide you with a coach and any provisions you need for the journey."

"Why must you be so cold?" Cordova lamented, throwing her hands up in the air. "I feel like you are tossing me to the wayside, like a broken toy you no longer have use for. Am I not desirable to you anymore?"

Lyon yanked her against him, growling, and kissed her, forcing her jaw wide as he plunged his tongue into her mouth. His kiss was brutal, punishing, and filled with a combination of longing and frustration. Even so, Cordova melted into him, her body responding with the same fervor it had when he'd first laid eyes on her.

Eventually, he pulled away. "I will always want you, Cordova," he breathed, pushing a stray lock of hair from her face. "But I cannot stand to see you in such torment. Go to your family. Be happy."

He turned on his heel then, and began to walk away from her. Cordova called after him once more, desperate, sorrowful. "I will come back to you."

King Lyon paused at the threshold of the door, only turning his head slightly to the side but enough to where she caught the glistening in his eyes. "Go home to your family, Cordova. You belong with them, not with me."

Without another word, he stepped over the threshold, and out of her life forever.
