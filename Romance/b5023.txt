I woke with a start, the room dark and unfamiliar. A warm presence to my right mumbled and hugged me in closer, and I slowly relaxed back into his soft embrace. The clock in Gregory King's ornate bedroom read a little after 3am. I still had at least two more hours left to sleep before my day would begin. I knew I was going to want to stay in bed, the idea of playing hooky with Mr. King made me smile, but I knew he would never go for it.

Running his business was practically an obsession with him. I was very much his employee, not his lover, at work, so these quiet moments were precious and few. I snuggled back into Mr. King's warm arms, letting his gentle breathing lull me back to sleep. My wrists ached from the cuffs he had me in earlier that evening, but the bruises were worth it. Every night spent with him was worth it. I let my thoughts wander as I closed my eyes to shut out the numbers on the clock.

My brain immediately tried to tick off the various meetings on the schedule that day; three development meetings, a payroll issue, lunch, a board meeting in which I was presenting the financial stability projections for the quarter, and the myriads of small issues I knew were going to pop up throughout the day. I let them all wash over me, letting each one have a second of my time before going on to the next. It was strangely relaxing to plan out my day in the safety of the dark morning. I loved my job.

I had been working directly with Mr. King for almost three months now, and I had found my rhythm. It had taken a few weeks to acclimate, but I was excelling and finding solutions to problems before they even registered as problems. It was also wonderful to be with Gregory King again. I felt him twitch in a dream, holding me tighter as he mumbled into my hair.

He was two separate people, and I found myself wanting to please both of them. The sweet and thoughtful man from college only came out when we were alone and filled my nights. The powerful businessman version, demanding and controlling, filled my days. He made sure to keep the two identities separate, and I had learned quickly that despite our evening rendezvous, I could expect no quarter from him if I failed any of his business demands.

I could feel sleep slowly creeping up on me. My brain slowly let the sweet darkness envelope me and I drifted off, safe and warm in Mr. King's arms.

***

Something felt off. The office had its normal hum, the secretaries busily clicking at computers, the phones ringing, and sporadic chatter filling the morning air, but I felt a tension in the air. It felt like a thunderstorm was coming, the office mood heavy and jumpy. The interns seemed to be hiding more than usual, and the secretary's voices seemed to squeak too brightly. Just as forest animals know when a storm is coming, the office knew something big was going to happen. I gathered my usual morning information, and went to find Edward Thayer, head of the antiviral department, to get the production updates I needed to brief Mr. King with that morning. Thayer was in panic mode when I found him.

"Oh God, Claire! I don't know how something like this could have happened! What the hell are we going to do? What am I going to do? I can't face him alone with this..."

Claire could almost see the life draining from him as he spoke. His skin was pale, except for flushed cheeks, and his hair looked like he had run his hands through it all morning. He was fluttering about his office like a frightened butterfly, never landing anywhere, but almost touching everything. He tried to pick up a folder, but it slid through his hands and fell to the floor. He stood for a moment and stared at the papers, his face crumpled like he might cry. I quickly bent and picked up the scattered papers and put them back in his shaking hands.

"Ed, you know I have your back in any meeting you might have with Mr. King. Now, what on earth is the matter?" I asked gently, putting a hand on his shoulder. His whole body seemed to be trembling.

"You haven't seen it yet then? Oh Claire- it is bad. So bad... Mr. King isn't going to just fire all of us- he is going to personally kill all of us. At least twice." his voice drifted into a mumble as fear shook through him.

I knew that, since Thayer had gotten this job he sometimes had a crisis of confidence. I understood, since he had overnight jumped three pay grades and been put in charge of over a hundred people. Usually when he got like this, I could defuse him with humor. "Let me see. It can't be that bad- at worst he will just kill you and make you zombie slaves. Saves on payroll," I tried gently, but my humor went right past him. His hands shook as he opened his laptop and handed it to me. Up on the screen was a email file addressed to the head of the antiviral company.

Dear Mr. King,

I have hacked your system. You destroyed me and now I am going to destroy you. Attached you will find a portion of the antiviral source code to prove that I have it. I have the entirety of it and will be selling it to anyone interested in purchasing the information. I also have used to it to develop a virus that is implanted in every computer in the King Corp. building.

If you wish to stop the virus, I want 5 million US dollars wired to an account in the Grand Caymans. If this is done by Wednesday at 5pm EST, I will disable the virus. For an additional 5 million I will not alert the media to the breach in your antiviral system. The last bit, the source code, will cost you 10 million for me to destroy all copies of.

You should never have fired me.

If you involve the authorities in any way, I will activate the virus and I will release this information to the public.

Sincerely,

Cirrus

I had to read it twice.

"I don't understand. I know that the virus would be bad because our anti-virus software would have no way of finding or stopping it, and I know that the public finding out about this would be bad, but why would releasing the source code destroy the company?" I asked confused. In my mind the worst would be that people would use the information to get free anti-virus, and while bad, not the end of the world.

"If he releases the source code, we have no way to stop other people from building mal-ware that can hide from our system. Every one of our customers would be vulnerable to attacks. If it got out that this had happened, no one would buy our software. Lawsuits would occur. Did you know we supply the government with this? National security would be compromised. If the source code is released, the company would never recover. We would all lose everything," Mr. Thayer explained.

I tried to wrap my brain around the concept and instead my thoughts flipped to when Mr. Cirrus had quit.

Mr. King snickered. "Your one sentence blurbs are no longer going to cut it around here." He paused. "Mr. Cirrus, Mr. Thayer, you're both aware of how important it is we meet this deadline, correct?" Both men answered with an affirmative. "Then you'll understand that I can't afford a shakeup in your department right now. Mr. Cirrus, at the conclusion of this project, your role will turn into more of an advisory one. You will be teaching Mr. Thayer the ins and outs of your current job, and once he's ready, I'll be transferring you to a position in RandD."

Mr. Cirrus sat there, with his mouth agape. "RandD? A demotion? Are you serious? After my department has hit all of its goals?"

Mr. King shot a glare back at him. "Yes, Mr. Cirrus, a demotion. You've disappointed me, even failed me, but you're too valuable to fire. A few months in RandD will remind me why I hired you, and remind you of..."

Mr. Cirrus cut him off. "You don't have to worry about giving me a job to cool my heels while I'm pushed into early retirement. I quit!" he yelled as he stood up and knocked his chair over. He gave a piercing glare at me, as if this was all my fault, before storming out of the room.

I remembered him leaving the building, escorted by security. He had yelled out that Mr. King would be sorry, that he would ruin him. Everyone had taken it as the ramblings of an unhappy, disgruntled employee. The implications of this email slowly began to hit me. This would be disastrous. Destroy the company and everyone who worked here's life disastrous.

Mr. Thayer sat at his desk, his eyes vacant and afraid. I had to salvage this. I had to get Thayer's confidence to the point where he would begin to work on this. If anyone could fix this situation it would be him. The man was a genius with computers. Since becoming the head of the department, the output and creativity of the whole company had skyrocketed. I stood up and grabbed his shoulders, shaking him gently.

"Look at me, Ed. We can fix this. Let's go tell Mr. King- we have to. This isn't your fault. He may be angry, but it will be at the situation, not you. He needs you to fix this. I know you can fix this. We will come up with a solution." My little speech sounded like a bad sports movie, but it seemed to perk him up. His eyes lost the glazed expression and he stood, teetering slightly. He grabbed his laptop and headed towards the door.

I heard him mumble something about whiskey and I thought I could use a bottle too.

***

To his credit, Mr. Thayer's voice never shook as he presented Mr. King the problem. His hands only trembled slightly as he handed over the laptop with the message displayed. He managed to only look vaguely like he might throw up as Mr. King read it. I wondered what kind of whiskey he would like after this.

Mr. King sat at his desk staring at the computer, his face incredulous. With extreme self control he stood slowly and walked around to where Mr. Thayer stood.

"The public cannot find out about this. We have to get this situation under control now." The cold fury in his voice frightened me. I had never seen him this angry, this cold. His hazel eyes burned with the fires of hell. If Cirrus had walked into that room, he would have frozen and died four horrible times in that sentence alone.

"Mr. Thayer, you have every resource at your disposal; Ms Vanders will be your point of contact. I want hourly updates." He handed the computer back to Thayer, his body stiff with fury. Mr. Thayer nearly dropped it, but managed to save it and scurry out of the office. Mr. King turned to me.

"You are with me until we figure this out. Pull up all the financials. Figure out where we can pull the twenty mil where the shareholders won't notice it missing. Look into Cirrus's financials. Look into anyone affiliated with him. I want information now." He growled with frustration. I nodded a quick yes and started setting up my computer in the corner of his office that I considered "mine".

I kicked off my heels, getting comfortable with my computer as I started to dredge through the reports and look for a solution. Page after page of reports flashed across the screen as I searched for the answer. Mr. Thayer called out to his secretary to cancel all appointments for the day. Mr. Thayer's assistant started bringing up reports, emails flew between the three of us. Lunch came and went, and I only stopped for a moment to snarf a sandwich Mr. King's secretary brought up for dinner.

I suddenly looked up and realized that I hadn't moved in two hours, but that I was nowhere close to finding what I was looking for. The room had turned dark and gloomy as night set in. I realized everyone else in the building had probably gone home for the evening.

It felt hopeless. I looked through the reports again, hoping that one of them would magically change, that I had somehow overlooked the simple solution and that it would just pop out and asked to be fixed. Mr. King must have read the defeat written across my face, as he closed his laptop and slid it into a drawer of his massive desk.

"I think we need something to clear our minds," he announced as he stood up and stretched his arms above his head. I leaned back in my chair, and stretched out my arms as well, surprised at the stiffness in my neck and shoulders. He looked at me with disapproval as I rolled my shoulders and worked out the tautness.

"Your posture is better, but you were still slouching. Are you wearing the duct tape now?" His voice betrayed nothing of what he was thinking. I rubbed my shoulder, thinking he was going to be displeased. I had been sitting properly, and I only ached because I had been sitting there for hours without moving. A small flare of indignation flared up, mad that he might be angry with me for something I didn't have control over.

I stifled it and shook my head no, waiting for his temperamental wrath. Instead of snapping at me for my posture, he grinned and opened his desk, fumbling in a drawer until he found a roll of the silver duct tape. His smile was wicked and predatory as he set it on the table.

"I think you need a lesson in why good posture is important." His voice held a heat that I never heard in the office. My panties suddenly moistened with anticipation. "Take your shirt off, Claire."

I stood slowly and unbuttoned my white dress shirt, placing it on my laptop bag. He picked up the tape and moved to my side of the desk, stroking my shoulder with his fingers as he moved behind me. Goosebumps slid down my arms after his touch, desire flooding through me.

He carefully undid the latch on my skin-tone bra. He gently kissed the spot where my shoulders join my neck, tickling the small hairs peeking out of my bun. I shivered as he slid the straps off and let the bra fall to the floor. One hand reached around and cupped one breast, feeling its weight in his hand. A small shiver shot through me, as he gently felt my breast with his fingers, massaging it and kissing my neck. I moaned quietly, and he chuckled, pulling his hand away.

I heard the tape peel off and rip, and held still while he ran the strip down my spine. I flexed my shoulders forward, feeling the skin pull under the tape. I giggled and peeked over my shoulder at him. I could see an erection forming under his slacks and my body ached to feel it. I wanted to feel him in me, I wanted the pleasure and pain that he could magically bring to my body.

He stepped forward and caught my chin in his hand, guiding me into his mouth. His lips and tongue found mine and I turned and pushed my bare chest into his dress shirt, grabbing his ass with my hands. His erection pushed into my hip, and I ground myself against it, feeling it harden. His hands found the zipper running down the back of my skirt, and he deftly undid it, letting it fall to the ground. I stood barefoot and na**d except for my sheer panties. They were already damp and getting wetter, my body ready to take him. I fumbled with his belt and the button on his pants, pulling them down to get at that marvelous piece of man that I knew could make my body sing.

A sharp rap on the door shocked me out of my current desire. Mr. King's secretary called through the door that she had some more papers for him. He looked at me in nothing but my undies, and I knew I couldn't get dressed fast enough. I grabbed my shirt, skirt, and bra and ran around to hid under his big wooden desk. It was solid in the front, so as long as she didn't walk around, she wouldn't see me na**d and hiding. Mr. King was right on my heels, his pants open and an erection making clear exactly what he had been thinking about. I ducked under the desk as he sat down and scooted the chair in, making it appear as though he were simply sitting and working.

It wasn't as cramped under the desk as I thought it would be, his knees spread apart to give me the most room he could while still covering himself with the desk as well. The desk was tall and I had a surprising amount of head room. I heard the door open and Ms. Aloutte walk in. Her heels clicked softly on the floor as she walked the file to the desk.

"Mr. Thayer wanted to make sure that you got these, there are some ideas that he wanted me to mention." I heard her pull up my chair and sit, apparently not leaving yet. The only thing I could see under the desk was Mr. King's erection, begging me to touch it. A naughty urge filled me, and I slowly reached out and caressed his bulging member. He jumped a little, but simply made it look as though he was shifting his weight. I kept touching him, and slowly worked his member out of his boxers so that it was free under the desk.

"Also, here is Mr. Cirrus's work computer. It was the company's, so he had to leave it. Mr. Thayer said he didn't find anything useful, but that maybe Ms. Vanders might. Where is she by the way? " Ms Aloutte chirped along, oblivious to what was going on under the desk. I wish I could have seen his face as I kept running my fingers along his shaft under the table. He responded to her question that I was in the bathroom, his voice struggling to maintain control.

The little imp in me decided to continue, wanting to push the envelope a little more. I leaned forward and ran my tongue slowly up his shaft, stopping to circle my tongue around the tip of his penis. A small salty pr**cum leaked out, and I licked at it like ice cream before taking him into my mouth and moving up and down. I could hear Ms. Aloutte's twittering laughter as she relayed more information to her boss. His legs were tensed and hard as he concentrated on keeping a straight face. I heard a stack of papers hit the desk and her tiny footsteps move towards the door. I kept my tongue swirling against him, tasting his hard-on, as she opened the door. She paused in the doorway.

"Do you need anything else tonight, Mr. King?" She chirped as I sucked on him.

"No, thank you. Have a good evening." He managed to keep his voice even as he thrust his h*ps up towards my mouth, urging me on for more. She tweeted a good night as she closed the door behind her. I felt Mr. King relax, and I released him from my mouth. He started to push back from the desk, thinking we were alone again, when the door opened again.

His knee banged against the desk as he pushed himself back under. The door opened and I heard her voice remind him about his appointment in the morning. The door closed again and we both held still, waiting to see if she was going to pop in again. After a breathless moment, he rolled his chair out and reached a hand down to help me stand. I giggled as I uncurled myself from the interior of the desk.

"You think that was funny? You are a bad, bad girl" he growled in my ear as he pushed me up against the desk, leaning me over the glossy dark wood. I could feel him pressing his raging erection, still wet with my spit, against my thin panties. My body ached with a desire that threatened to melt my core. I literally dripped with desire as he pushed me down against the cool surface of the desk, his hand hot against my back.

"Bad girls get punished. Put your arms out on the desk." His voice was low and quiet and for a moment I was afraid I had actually displeased him. My stomach dropped into my knees as I slowly put my hands flat on the desk, my arms circling my head like a ballerina dance pose. I didn't dare look up to see his face.

I heard the unmistakable sound of the duct tape ripping, and then he pressed a strip against my wrist, pinning it to the desk. A second strip peeled off and secured my other wrist, taping me to his desk, my ass still hanging off the edge. A third and fourth strip screeched off the duct tape roll. The roll made a soft thud as he threw it on the ground and then carefully lined either side of my back with the last two strips of tape. I knew those were going to hurt when he pulled them off, the sticky tape already pulling at the tiny hairs with every breath I took.

I bit my lip, waiting to see what he was going to do. I was being punished for surprising him, putting him in a potentially embarrassing situation. I loved it; the thrill of surprising him and now the price of him getting even with me was turning me on more than I thought it would.

I heard the slap of his hand before I felt it, my ass suddenly on fire from his hand. I yelped with surprise at his spank, and he quickly followed it with another. My right butt cheek burned with each spank of his hand. His hand flicked my skin in just the right manner to make a loud crack sound that sent a jolt up my body. Each slap lined up perfectly with the last, and I knew there would be a perfect hand print size circle on my ass in the morning.

My skin buzzed with the electricity of him hitting me, punishing me for misbehaving as he spanked me five times in rapid succession. After the fifth zap, he stopped, gently rubbing two fingers across the blossoming red mark. My nerves screamed with sensation, the pain followed by the soft touch were almost unbearable.

Without warning, he ripped one of the outside strips of duct tape off my back. I screamed into the desk, hoping the room was soundproofed, my ass forgotten for the moment. He ran a finger down the red line forming on my back, ran it across the red welt on my ass, and then around the curve of my butt and in between my legs. My legs opened easily to let his hand slide between them, and he slowly caressed my cl*t through the lacy panties. I groaned and spread my legs wider, hoping he would do more, but instead he withdrew his hand.

I waited, panting on the desk, not knowing what was going to come next, my breath fogging the reflective gloss. He hooked his finger around my panties, and dragged them off my body. As they passed the growing red mark from the spankings, it made me gasp. He gently kissed the spot, then positioned himself behind me.

I could feel his rod hovering on the edge of my slit, waiting to dive in. I wanted him so badly, it seemed like all I had ever wanted was that c**k inside me. I wanted him to f**k my brains out on that desk and give me my sweet release. I felt him push just the tip inside of me, and as he slowly pushed himself into me he ripped off the second outside strip of tape. The pleasure of him filling me combined with the sharp pain of the tape ripping down my back made my body arch and cry out for more.

He began rocking into me, filling me with his massive cock. He grabbed my hips, his thumb on the spanking welt, diving into me. Each thrust filled me with pleasure, my pu**y trying to take more and more of him, while his thumb massaged my poor ass. I could feel my body responding to the double stimulus, the pleasure mounting inside of me with a force I had to release. I began to shake with the effort, my hands struggling against the tape as my world crescendoed into a ball of color and sensation. I heard myself cry out with joy as spasms of bliss racked my body.

When I finished shaking, his hand slammed down onto the opposite ass cheek.

"I didn't say you could come." He growled, lust heavy in his voice. I rocked my ass in time with his thrusts, feeling him fill me with each plunge. I wanted to take every inch of him I could as deep inside of me as I could. He began to grunt with effort, his thrusts becoming less regular. He swelled inside of me, and then with a groan, let loose inside of me. I could feel his come cover my insides, coating me with his seed.

I whimpered into the table as he kept pushing in and out of me, sliding on his own river. With one final plunge, he then pulled out and cleaned himself up, leaving me exposed and dripping on the desk. I waited patiently for him to release me. Come dripped down my leg, and my ass throbbed as I waited. He took his time, but finally I felt him behind me again.

Without warning a final spank landed on my bruised ass, making me cry out into the room. I heard him chuckle as he pulled the tape off my wrists. I slid to the floor and onto my knees, rubbing my wrists. He reached down a hand, helping to my feet and I stood on shaky legs. He pulled me in close, grabbing my ass and making me squirm as pain shot through it.

"Don't do that again. At least not without my permission" His voice held a threat, but it was softened by a smile. He let me go and handed me a box of tissues and I cleaned myself up and then redressed, my underwear cold and damp against me.

I sat gingerly back into my chair, a bruise forming that I knew would keep me from sitting properly for days. Mr. King grinned as a wiggled to find a comfortable position, knowing that I would have this reminder to behave myself. I pouted at him and he shrugged, opening his laptop and staring into it. With a sigh, I opened mine and began looking for a solution yet again.

***

Sunlight streamed in through the open windows and woke me. I had fallen asleep on my keyboard, and I could feel a funny red pattern of a space bar and several letters etched onto my face. Mr. King walked into the room with two cups of coffee and a box of doughnuts. The look on my face must have been priceless, as he nearly spilled the coffee giggling at my disheveled hair and keyboard face.

He of course looked perfect, his blonde hair spilling across his forehead with boyish charm. I scowled and grabbed the coffee as I headed to the bathroom to clean up. I heard Ms. Aloutte knock on the door and announce Mr. Thayer. I hurried back out to find Ed Thayer bouncing anxiously in Mr. King's chair as he pulled up information on his computer. His eyes were too bright and his hair stuck out at odd angles. He was pointing animatedly to the computer screen, his voice cracking and rising an octave as he spoke.

"I found the virus! It was hidden in the back subcode..." Thayer beamed as he showed Mr. King how and where he found the virus. "My team already has a patch made and is administering it to the network. His virus won't do a damn thing now!"

Mr. King clapped him on the back, a smile growing on his face. The two of them continued to speak in computer code as Thayer showed him the virus. From what I could understand, it was a pretty piece of work that would have caused the entire building's computers to think they needed a restart, and that they would then be frozen in the reboot, effectively shutting everything down. I sat down and listened to them speak in their foreign computer language as I began sifting through the financial files next to my laptop.

"The best part is that he had to make it so that there was a remote switch to activate the virus. If he tries to activate the virus, then he has to communicate with the computers here to do it. I have a software program that I have been working on, that can help us trace his source when he does this. Unfortunately, it isn't really finished, so it may not be perfect- especially if he is smart and tries to deflect us through mirrored servers..."

"Wait," I cut him off as I finally understood part of the conversation not completely in computer-speak. "Would knowing what part of the world he is in help?"

The two of them stared at me for a minute, Thayer's mouth working but no words coming out. I took that as a yes and displayed a couple of files to them. "Between the accounts that he deposited his paychecks in, the bank that he wants the money deposited, his recent credit card usage, and a couple other things, I have a pretty good idea what part of the world he is hiding in. I actually think he is still in the country, which seems strange to me."

"The firewall to the company for the files he hid the virus in will only allow United States access... How do you have his credit card information?" Mr. King looked a strange combination of proud and concerned.

"That was easy enough- he never cleared his cookies off his laptop. It is company property, so when I was looking through it, I was able to access his account," Mr. King's face contorted still further into a concerned look. "I just realized that what I did may not be terribly legal, but desperate times right?" I looked back and forth at them as they continued to just stare at me.

"He didn't clean out his cookies? The financial person thought of a computer answer before the computer people. I knew I liked you!" Mr. Thayer's face broke out in a grin as Mr. King nodded incredulous at my computer savvy. I breathed a sigh of relief and continued to show them what I found.

"He hasn't used his card for a couple of days, but based on this information, I would put him in the southeast US. Probably Florida as it will have easy access to the Bahamas to get out of the country quick once the money comes in."

The two of them beamed at me. Mr. King gave me the special smile that he only gave me when we were alone at his home and I basked in it. I suddenly frowned as a cold thought popped my sunshine bubble.

"So we have stopped the virus and can track it back to where he is, but how is this going to keep him from leaking the source code- if he hasn't already?" The two of them surprised me with smiles. Mr. King motioned for Thayer to tell me the answer.

"The code he took is from last year- since he didn't get to keep his work computer he had to use what was on his personal one. The sample he sent us is older code. It looks a lot like the current code, but as I looked at it I recognized it from the stuff Cirrus helped develop. When I was put in charge, we revamped much of the code. Most of the stuff made off of this source code would be stopped or easily patched in with the newer code I wrote."

He tried to keep the pride out of his voice, but he knew that his innovations were saving the day. "It would still be pretty awful for the press to find out about this though, so we want to stop him before he can do any real damage. It isn't quite all sunshine and roses- we need him to activate the virus but not the press." He leaned back into the leather chair, his eyes still bright but some of the energy fading out of him.

"His version of the source code could still do some serious damage, especially in the PR department. We still have some serious work to do. Claire, see if you can't pinpoint his location further and Thayer, I have a couple of ideas I want to run." Mr. King's smile was gone as he leaned back towards the computer, and started us back to work.

***

Wednesday arrived. The three of us had worked non-stop to prepare for the 5pm deadline; I never left the office during those three days. It was now 3pm and everything that could be in place was. I felt a nervous energy pouring through my system, and I couldn't sit still or concentrate on my other work.

Unfortunately the crisis didn't stop my other job responsibilities, and I had neglected them for the past couple of days. I filtered through my emails and to do list, trying to find something productive to do that could distract me from the tedium of waiting.

I found a note I had made towards the beginning of my career at King Enterprises. Some of the accounting numbers didn't look right to me; I had worked with finances and bookkeeping for my entire adult career and as I looked at the books for King Enterprises something in my gut growled. I decided that this was as good a time as any to look for what was bothering me, as I couldn't seem to concentrate on anything anyway, so I sat down at my desk and began loading the files up on my screen.

"Vanders." A sharp female voice accosted me. "Why haven't you emailed me the budget for next quarter? You missed the last two meetings and I need this done now. Good lord- what do we pay you for?" Olivia Robertson glared at me. I sighed and turned to her. She was always angry at me for some reason or another. The first time I had met her she had glared at me through my introduction to the board. I didn't know what I had done to make her so angry then, and I still had no idea why she seemed to hate me so vehemently.

"The proposal will be in your box tomorrow- I emailed you the original options and Mr. King still hasn't approved them. I can't make him do this any faster." I tried to stay calm and put what I hoped passed for cheery on my face. She rolled her eyes and stormed off, her blonde hair swishing as she walked. She was quite pretty, I thought. Pretty awful. I looked over at the clock to see it click to 4:30. Finally, time for something to happen. I closed my computer and headed up to Mr. King's office.

Mr. Thayer was already there, tapping his foot nervously, but confidence plastered across his face. He grinned up at me as I entered the room, Mr. King's smile following right behind. I sat at my spot at his desk and waited.

Mr. King's email pinged as a new message hit.

Where is my money?

Mr. King calmly hit reply and typed, It's not coming. Send.

Ping. Your funeral.

Mr. King nodded to Mr. Thayer, and we stared at his computer screen. The screen flicked as Cirrus attempted to activate the virus. Thayer's tracking program initiated and dominated the screen.

"It found the IP address. It's part of a subnet that's licensed to a motel chain in Miami. In fact, only one motel in the chain doesn't require a credit card to rent a room." He grinned, his excitement humming through the room at the success.

"Perfect. Inform our friends." Mr. King relaxed into his chair, barely able to keep a grin off his face.

Within ten minutes the local police had the only room in the motel rented by a single man who paid cash under surveillance. I imagined what it must have looked like, in a dingy motel room in Miami, Florida. Cirrus bent over his computer, angrily triumphant and releasing his revenge on King Enterprises, when suddenly the door is beat down and men in black suits storm the room.

I tried not to giggle as I thought of the look on his face as the FBI Cyber Crime unit took him down. He was going to go to prison for a long time, and King Enterprises was safe. We had won. Mr. King stood behind me as a phone call from the FBI came in saying they had caught him with all the evidence they needed. His hands felt warm and perfect on my shoulders and he squeezed them in victory.

***

I played with the pearl necklace he had given me a few months ago as I sat, Mr. King across the table staring at me. We had just finished dessert, a Sacher Torte. It was at least 3 layers of dark chocolate fudge cake, with apricot jam and chocolate ganache between the layers, and dark chocolate glaze on top. I had never tasted anything so delicious and decadent. He smiled at me and filled my wine glass up, his eyes dark with desire. I craved him. I wanted him covered in a dark chocolate glaze.

He must have been able to read my thoughts, because he stood and held his hand out for me. His hand felt warm in mine, and I carried my wine glass with us as he led me to his bedroom. As we reached the door, he paused at the door, his hand lingering on the handle. With a smile, he pushed the door open to reveal the bedroom bathed in candlelight. Tea light candles adorned the furniture, dozens of candles flickering with a soft golden glow. It was beautiful. I set my glass down and kissed him passionately, our lips meeting with joy.

The door closed softly behind us, as he kissed me again, taking me into his arms and questing his tongue deep into my mouth. I moaned into his kisses, his hands sliding up and down on my satin dress. He found the zipper and undid the back, letting the dress slide off and onto the floor. A sweet smile crossed his face as his hand grazed my pearls, obviously happy I had worn them to dinner. With gentle kisses, he crept down my neck, down my shoulders and down my arm to my hand. He brought my hand to his lips and kissed it like a gallant knight.

I wondered how happy silly my smile was as I slipped off my shoes and he brought me around to the bed. I noticed that he had a single black satin sheet on the bed and that it had a smattering of pink rose petals. I picked one up and twirled it in my fingers, trying my best to look coy.

"I thought you earned a romantic evening after this week's excitement. I couldn't have done it without you." His voice was low and husky, making my skin itch with desire. I started to speak, but he placed a single finger over my lips, gently shushing me.

"Don't say anything. Just enjoy this." And then he kissed me. My heart fluttered with his kiss; it was so full of want, of need. His hand slipped around and undid my strapless bra, letting it fall to the floor. He then kissed down my neck again, my hands going to his beautiful hair as he kissed each nipple, making them stand hard and erect, ready for more.

He knelt before me and continued to kiss my br**sts as his hands worked off my lacy panties. A shiver rippled through me as he blew gently on my wet ni**les, letting his kiss marks cool my skin. He stood up slowly, and wrapped a black satin scarf around one wrist and motioned me up onto the bed. He loosely tied the scarf to one of the tall bedposts. It was loose enough that I could touch my face with the tied hand, but firm enough that he would always be in control. I loved it.

I stretched out on the bed, feeling the cool satin slip beneath my skin, the rose petals soft and fragrant. I looked over to see him slowly disrobing. He unbuttoned his shirt and took it off slowly, the firelight glancing off his muscles and creating beautiful shadows. His pants slid into a pool on the floor and he stood naked, his erection growing as he looked down on my tied to his bed.

He grinned his predatory grin, and picked up a candle from the nightstand. I raised my eyebrows as he approached with it, unsure what he was doing. He raised the candle high above my stomach and slowly tipped it, letting the wax drip and fall onto my stomach. The hot wax seared across my bellybutton, quickly hardening and the pain subsiding. My spine felt like a rod of molten metal, threatening to consume me with want.

A low chuckle rippled through the dark as he slowly climbed onto the bed and straddled my legs. He let the candle wax build again, and brought it closer to my skin, this time dripping a long line from my bellybutton up to my cle**age. The sudden heat made me squirm with delight, and he put his weight down onto my legs to keep me still. I watched the candle flicker above me as he waited for the wax to pool again, the waiting keeping tension tight within me. That predatory grin flashed as he poured the wax across the tops of my br**sts, the wax splattering and dripping down across my skin; the heat searing through to my core, making me want more.

He set the candle onto the flat space between my ribcage and bellybutton, his hand holding it steady against my skin. With his free hand he slowly pet my vaginal lips, sending little shoots of pleasure at the soft touch. He slowly peeled me open, revealing my cl*t to his eager fingers. He began a simple two finger swirling motion, blood rushing to fill my clit, sensation pouring into me.

I arched my h*ps up into his hand, wanting more but the motion moved the candle and caused it to spill the hot wax onto my sensitive skin. I cried out with pleasure and pain, wanting to rock my h*ps into his hand but fearing the sear of the wax. I could feel the thrum inside me reaching a fever pitch, my body craving release, my core a ball of fire as I approached my release.

"Come for me," he whispered as I slowly tipped into ecstasy. I couldn't stop my h*ps from bucking upward, my body writhing with pleasure as my orgasm took me. Wax poured out from the candle, spilling across my abdomen, the heat scorching through me and adding extra sensation to my vibrating body. I screamed with pleasure as my orgasm didn't stop, the pain pushing me immediately into a second, with no pause between. My lungs gasped for oxygen as pleasure made me forget to breathe, my body quaking with bliss.

As I slowly stopped shaking, and my body returned to me, Mr. King set the candle on the table. I looked up at him, the candle light flickering and making his eyes glow as he slid one knee between my legs, opening me further to his desires. His erection was full and hard, my orgasm obviously turning him on. He took it in his hand and ran it up and down along my pu**y lips, letting my juices cover him before he entered.

He slowly pushed the tip against my opening, and forcefully pushed through the slight resistance to enter me. I moaned softly, pulling my arm against its restraint as he pushed deep into me. My body sang as he filled me completely, and then cried out as he slid back out again. He straddled my leg and continued to push deep into me, pulling out slowly only to fill me totally again. We found a rhythm, him pulsing into me and me rising my h*ps to meet him. I let myself get lost in our rhythmic dance, the soft light making me think I was in heaven.

He slowly pulled out, and moved off my legs, and growled softly to get on my hands and knees. I turned perpendicular to the bed, maneuvering my tied arm into position. I could feel his heat behind me as he slowly penetrated deeply into me. I screamed with pleasure, feeling him skewer me, his hands gripping my hips. He pounded his c**k as hard as he could, and he spanked my ass in the same spot as he had abused the other day. A wordless cry filled the room as a spike of pain seared into my world.

He put a hand on the middle of my shoulder blades and pushed my head down into the bed. I tucked my knees into my chest, my cheek pressed into the slippery satin. I felt his hand leave my back, and instead of feeling him grab a hold of my hip, I instead felt hot wax pour onto my back. My cry was muffled by the mattress as the wax quickly cooled on my hot skin. I could feel it harden and crack as he continued to stuff himself into me.

I could feel his c**k swelling, his pattern becoming erratic as I waited for him to come into me. The slight extra growth increased my pleasure, and the slight grunt and groan as he released, made my body respond in kind. I could feel my pu**y contracting down on his c**k as he released his stream of white into me. I squeezed with all my might, milking his c**k for every drop I could squeeze.

I sighed with loss as he slowly pulled out, both of us satiated and content. He ran his fingers down my spine, somehow still eliciting shivers at his touch. He carefully untied me, his fingers caressing my skin as he removed the satin. I kissed him, drinking him in as deeply as possible. He gave me the smile that he reserved for only me, the one I only saw when we were very alone and he was completely happy. I couldn't help but feel pure happiness as I looked at him.

He kissed my hand again, and instead of letting go, pulled me gently to the bathroom. I followed him like a happy puppy. He hit several buttons, turning on the massive shower to the settings that I enjoyed; steam filled the room as he pulled me into the water, multiple jets pouring hot water onto us both. I sighed with contentment as he began working the soap into a lather on my body, happy to have the billionaire's trust.
