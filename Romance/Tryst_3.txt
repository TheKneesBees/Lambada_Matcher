NEW YORK, NEW YORK

5:42am

Apprehension twists my stomach in knots. I barely sleep. Every two seconds another thought, another sensation, courses through me and I know that I don't want to lose Michael again, but I don't know how to keep him either. This new relationship we have feels temporary. I wonder how much more he wants. And the look in his eyes when he pulled away last night-it was enough to make p**sy damp. He wants to f**k my ass. His voice sings in my ears even though he's been gone for hours. I push the covers away and decide to get up. There's no way I can sleep anyway.

I pad to the kitchen and turn on the coffee maker. As it gets hot, I sit on the couch because the kitchen chair is too hard. I smile to myself thinking about his hands on my skin, the way his slaps sting perfectly. I can't believe I like that, but I do. It brings the blood to the surface of my skin and everything feels, well, it just feels more. I can't explain it. But getting f**ked in the ass, that makes me cringe. I've never done it before and there is no way it's not going to hurt. And I seriously doubt it's a kind of good hurt. I groan and throw my head back against the sofa. Why did I say that? Why did I tell him whatever he wanted? I can't let him do that. It doesn't even sound appealing. It just sounds incredibly dirty.

The day passes too quickly. By the time I'm unpacking my cello at the theatre I'm a ball of nerves. Everything makes me jump. Every person who brushes against me, every hushed voice whispering in the wings makes me jitterier. My heart flutters as I look around the room for Michael, but he isn't here. I straighten my blouse, and smooth my skirt with my palms before removing my cello from the case. The nipple chains hang freely beneath my shirt, and I wore the third chain tonight-the one that attaches to my clit. I feel like a poser. I'm not the dangerous naughty girl who got these piercings. I'm not her. I'm nervous, and timid and shy. Why the hell did I say yes?

Tension laces my shoulders as I make my way to my seat. Taking my cello by the neck, I turn it toward me and start to tune. I pluck each string, checking the tone and then spin it back around to make the final adjustments. As I lean forward to reach the fine tuners at the bottom of the instrument, my nipple chain peeks out of my shirt. It collides with my cello and makes a strange sound as it drags against the wood. I glance down, horrified, and see the silver chain pushed through the slit in my blouse.

A masculine voice whispers in my ear, "Let me get that for you." I freeze as Michael leans in close, his fingers pushing the silver chain back into my shirt. I sit ram rod straight in my chair. My heart is pounding, ready to explode. Surly, everyone saw what he did, but as I glance around, no one seemed to notice. He grins and lowers himself into the empty chair in front of me. "I'm looking forward to tonight, Ash."

My smile is timid, my voice hollow, "About that..."

"Don't tell me that you're nervous? The sex goddess of the upper west side is nervous?" his voice is playful and I can't help but smile. My lashes lower and I look at the cello, the reddish gleam of the shiny wood. He places his hand on mine, and my gaze drifts up-meeting his. His voice is a breath, "I'll make sure you want it. Before we're done tonight, you're going to beg me to take your ass. I promise."

My face flames and he grins. "It's so easy to make you blush. How the hell did you get into all this stuff anyway?"

My lips part, but I don't know what to say. I'm not really into any of it, or hadn't been, until I saw Michael again. The piercings were as far as I got and then no one caught my interest. I didn't want to be a sub for just anyone. I wanted Michael. I guess I never got over him. "By accident," I finally manage. Which was partly true. I went into the piercing place to get my eyebrow done and walked out with something very different.

The way he looks at me makes me squirm. It's like he's replaying last night in his mind and I can see it in his eyes. He pats my hand and stands, "You'll beg me for it." His eyebrows waggle at me, "Wait and see." He walks across the pit to his seat opposite me, and looks back over his shoulder once. Those blue eyes kill me. They pin me in place and rip any rational thought out of my brain.

The evening's performance feels like it flies by. My stomach feels like it's in a free fall the entire time. Whenever I look up, Michael is gazing at me with a dark expression that makes it worse. What did I do? My fingers press down on the strings as I play, trying to lose myself in the music-but I can't. Was he right? Would I like it? Would it feel good to have his dick in my ass? I didn't see myself every begging for something like that. Our eyes meet as I glance up, meaning to look at the conductor. He gives me a look that makes my entire body flare to life. I can't breathe. Fuck!

As I play, my mind forms a plan. I'll tell him that we can do anything else, that I was too brazen last night. The thought of alcohol passes through my brain, but I don't want to be drunk. I want to want it. I want to feel him and remember it. This is our last night together. After we play the last note, the same thing happens. I cross the stage and open my case. I loosen my bow and stow it. Michael comes up behind me.

He leans against the wall and grins at me, "Ready, Ash?" His dark brows twitch once as his gaze slides to my br**sts. I nod as I latch my case closed. "Did you wear all three chains tonight?"

I look at him wide-eyed and hiss, "Yes. Damn, you're so loud."

"Hmmm," he slides his arm around my back and pulls me to him. His hand pushes a stray hair away from my eyes, "We'll see who's louder after tonight." Even though I try to control it, I blush. I know what he means, what he wants to do to me, what I offered.

He lifts my case and we decide to go back to my place. Michael carries my cello the entire way home. I feel shy, worried. I glance up at him out of the corner of my eye as we enter my apartment. "I don't know if I can do it," I say.

He puts the cello down and lays his violin next to it. After closing the door, he turns to me, "I promised that I wouldn't hurt you, and I mean it, Ash. I want this. You want this-" I start to cut him off with a protest, but he puts his finger over my lips and leans close to my face. He tilts his head, studying me, and says, "On some level, you want it, Ash. I know you do. You wanted to completely give yourself to me, and this fulfills that need. You want me and I want you." His hands tangle in my hair. He kisses my mouth softly and pulls away. "We're doing this Ashley. Me and you. Now." He leans in, his lips a breath away from mine, "and you're going to beg me for it."

Longing erupts within me. I wish I did want it. I wish I had the slightest desire for him to shove his dick up my ass, but I don't. I want him in my mouth and in my p**sy. I want to feel him ride me and spank me.

I don't say anything for a moment.

He releases me and looks around the apartment. We are in the living room area that flows into the kitchen. It's not a very big space. I wonder how he'll start. My hands shake as butterflies tear through my stomach. I fold my arms over my chest, but Michael takes my hands and gently parts them.

He steps toward me and his fingers take hold of the bow that holds my shirt together. He pulls the string and the blouse falls open. I watch him as he does it, my pulse ratcheting up a few notches. "Same rules as last time?" he asks, and leans in to kiss my neck. The moment the kiss connects, my brain melts. The hesitation of what he wants doesn't leave, but it doesn't dominate me any longer. I want him to dominate me, not my emotions.

"Yes," I breathe.

He nips my neck and trails a path of kisses across my back as he slides the shirt off my shoulders. "I'll come in your ass, and you aren't going to make a sound." His hands lace around me as he says it, and he tugs gently on the silver chains attached to my n**ples. I moan on purpose. When I look over my shoulder at him, I push my hip out, offering him my ass to slap.

Instead of spanking me, he turns me toward him. "Punishments are supposed to hurt, Ash. And that was definitely defiant. I'm going to punish you differently this time. Come here." I step toward him. Michael lowers his gaze to my br**sts. He reaches out and takes hold of my n**ples and squeezes. It doesn't seem like a punishment at first. He pulls me across the room to the table. "Sit," he says, releasing me.

I slide up onto the table wearing my skirt and my bra. My n**ples ache when he releases me. Michael stands there for a moment, stroking his chin and says, "Give me the bra." I reach behind me and take it off. I hand the lace to him and he presses it to his cheek. "It's still warm."

My br**sts hang freely, the three silver chains sparkle in the dim light. Michael's gaze is still on my chest and I know my punishment will have something to do with my br**sts. My heart pounds as I wait for him to decide. When he reaches for my breast, I feel afraid and excited. He takes a nipple in one hand and presses it between his forefinger and thumb. As he looks me in the eye, the pressure increases. I suck in air quickly, but I bite my tongue. He holds me like that for a second and then flicks my nipple hard with his other hand. The sting erupts inside of me. It feels like the spank magnified. My jaw drops open, and I try to swallow the sound, but it comes out. Michael shakes his head slowly, side to side, "I will teach you to be quiet." He takes the other nipple and presses it between his fingers. Tears sting my eyes from the last flick. It hurt, but the initial sting felt so intense that I couldn't stay quiet. My back stiffens as his other hand nears my nipple. He does it slower this time. My pulse pounds in my ears. My body tenses, waiting for the sting of his hand. When Michael does it this time, he flicks the tender flesh hard. Seductive pain spreads instantly from my n**ples to my p**sy. He rolls my nipple between his fingers before releasing me.

"Good girl," he says. He looks me over, and his gaze fills with heat. He peels off his jacket and tosses it on the couch. I watch him as he removes his tie and shoes. Heart pounding, I watch, hoping he'll remove his shirt. He notices my gaze lingering on his chest and says, "You want me to take this off, don't you?" He lifts his shirt and eyes me.

I nod once. "Yes."

"Come here," he says. I step toward him, closing the space between us. "Take it off of me," he commands. A small thrill shoots through me. I start at the top and work my way down, slowly sliding each button through the hole. When I undo the last button, I stop and look up at him. His shirt front hangs open, revealing a perfectly toned chest. I want to lean forward and lick his stomach and drag my tongue all the way up to his neck, but I don't. He hasn't told me to. I wait for his command.

"Turn around," he says. The husky tone of his voice drips with seduction. My stomach stirs in response. I turn and face the table, putting my palms down. "Ankles apart," he says. I'm still wearing my heels and part my legs. Michael grabs my skirt and slides it up, revealing my lace-topped thigh highs and garters as he does it. "Very nice," he says appreciatively. His hand cups my ass. He squeezes me once and then dips his hand between my legs. His voice deepens when he does, "Crotchless panties?"

I nod, "Yes."

"Just for me?" his voice is in my ear. Every inch of me feels hypersensitive. I want his hands on me, in me. But he pauses there, asking.

"Yes, I thought you'd like them. And the garters..."

He lowers his face and looks closer at my ass, and between my legs. "I do," he says and his warm breath spreads across my p**sy. I suck in a breath and try to stay still. "Ashley?"

"Yes?" I look over my shoulder at him.

"Put your br**sts on the table. Lower yourself until you are as flat as you can get." I nod and lean forward. I'm shaking worried about what he's going to do. He can tell and says, "I'm not f**king your ass tonight until you beg me. I was serious. Right now, I have my sights set on f**king your p**sy." With that his hard length pushes into me without any warning. I gasp. He slaps my ass for making a sound. My hands reach across the table and hold onto the other side.

I'm wet enough that it doesn't hurt, but he's so big and so deep. I can feel every inch of him. He stays like that for a moment and then pulls out slowly. "Oh baby, you have no idea how perfect you are. I could f**k you like this all night." He pushes hard into me again. Each of his hands is splayed on my hips, holding me in place. With every thrust, my legs bang into the table. He withdraws and commands me to stay the way I am.

His fingers tease, moving in slow delicious strokes around my clit. I want him to touch me, to rub me, but he doesn't. His fingers slip next to my cl*t and around it. My h*ps start to move, trying to get him to touch me. In response, his hand comes down hard, spanking my p**sy. "Be still," he barks. I don't move.

It's so hard not to move, to not make a sound. He teases me ruthlessly with his hands, working both of them over my sensitive flesh. My fingers grip the table until my knuckles turn white. I grit my teeth to keep still, to keep from calling out. I feel a finger slip into my p**sy, but he pulls it away again, spreading my come over me. He lowers his face and continues to tease me with his tongue.

I can't stand it. Every inch of my body is coursing with need. If he doesn't f**k me soon, I'll die. I need him. I need him inside of me. I want him in my p**sy, in my mouth. I have to have him.

Breathing hard, he looks around the room and spies a small bench across the room. He pulls me up from the table and strips the skirt, leaving the panty and stockings. "Go," he says, pushing me toward it.

Before we get to the bench, he grabs my shoes and tells me to put them on. They have a four inch heel. I stop in front of the bench wearing only my shoes, stockings, the crotchless panties, and my collar. My body is charged. I have enough energy to ride him until tomorrow. Every inch of me burns, yearning for his touch. I want his hands on me, in me. I can't stand the teasing anymore.

Before I can beg him to f**k me, he yanks the chain, pulling me toward him and kisses me so softly on the lips that I melt. Every inch of me sears as his skin presses against mine. Sex is dripping from every inch of me. I want him inside of me and will do anything he wants to have him. His soft kiss lingers, and I feel his swollen lips lift from mine.

"Turn," he says. I turn toward the bench wondering what he's planning.

It's a padded leather seat, nothing fancy. Four wooden legs hold it high off the floor. I sit on it when I put my shoes on in the morning. I stare at it wondering what he wants to do. We don't both fit on it. My hand touches my throat and drifts across my breast, and then down my waist as I stare at the leather.

His hands snake around my waist and cup my breast. I close my eyes and inhale, feeling his fingers pulling on the barbells that runs through my n**ples and not the chain. He releases me and says, "Lean forward."

I look at the bench and lean my hands down on it with my ass in the air. He watches me for a moment and says, "Lean forward more." I lean my elbows onto the bench so that my h*ps wrest on the leather. He walks to the other side with the belt in his hand. "More," he says, and I lean all the way over the bench. My ass is high on one side and my head is hanging over the other. Michael grabs my wrists and fastens them to the metal bar on the bottom of the bench with his belt. He kicks the bench around, and steers my ass so that we are in front of the large dressing mirror next to the bed.

I see him walk back around behind me, fingers stroking his stubbled chin. He disappears in my closet and comes back with two scarves. He kicks my legs apart and ties each leg to the bench. My br**sts are under me, the chain is pulled taut. My head leans off one end, but it's not uncomfortable. My heart is pounding in my chest. I don't know what he's going to do. My stomach curls as I close my eyes, clenching tight, thinking about what he might do.

He kneels behind me, and I see him do it. He lowers his face to my ass, and licks me. His tongue moves down the center of my ass and I cry out. I didn't expect him to. No one has done that to me before.

He spanks me and says, "Quiet."

He lowers his face to my ass and does it again, forcing his tongue inside, and I'm silent this time. He pushes at the soft skin, licking me until I want to scream. The dampness between my legs is growing wetter. I clench and close my eyes, biting my lip.

He's watching me in the mirror. Doing it again, he presses a finger inside of my ass, stretching me. I can't be quiet. I moan as he does it and the harder I moan, the deeper he pushes. I pull against the restraints, wishing I could move. He teases me more, sliding his fingers in my ass and his other hand in my p**sy.

"Beg me," he says. He pushes both into my ass and my p**sy at the same time and I can't think anymore.

I'm an animal, not a woman. I need him, I want him. I wiggle my butt against his hand, trying to move. The harder I gasp, the more he does it until both hands are pushing into me, hard and deep. I want more, I want him there. I want him to f**k my ass and when I say it, there is no doubt how much I want it, "Please, please f**k my ass. I need it. I want you there. Oh God! Please baby! Please."

"Please what?" he says, pushing his fingers into me, stroking my p**sy as he teases my ass.

"Please f**k my ass. Fuck it hard. I want it. Please, baby. Please..." My face is turned away from the glass when he stops. His hands leave my bottom and he stands. I'm so disappointed that I could cry. I did what he said. I begged him. I glance at him, ready to do anything he wants, anything he says just to have him inside me again. I'm so wet, so hot-my body trembles as he pulls away.

"Watch me," he says. "Look in the mirror and watch me come."

My stomach clenches and my body ignites, ready for him-wanting him. This is what he promised. He lowers himself on my back. His dick is hard and presses against me. Instead of shoving inside, he moves lower, and pushes into my p**sy. He thrusts hard, three times, making his dick wet. Then he pulls out. My body is so hot, so slick. He moans and it sounds so deep and carnal that I shiver. His dick slides between my cheeks and this time when he pushes on my ass, he forces himself inside. I feel him penetrate, and sink in slowly. I struggle not to cry out. I wish my legs weren't tied. I want to move, I want to feel every inch of him, as deep as he can go. As if he read my mind, Michael meets my gaze in the mirror, and I can tell he knows what I want. My p**sy is clenching wildly against nothing, and I can barely control myself. I want him to push harder, deeper. I want to move and writhe against him.

"Push back," he says.

Relieved, I lift my ass slightly and push against him. He pushes in deeper and I thrust back with my hips, feeling him inside of me. His hands find my hair.

Michael pulls my chin up so I can see us in the mirror, "Watch me take you. Watch me fill you with come."

I meet his burning blue gaze. He's no longer gentle. Michael rides me, pushing harder and deeper. My h*ps thrust back against him. I moan, thrusting up with my hands, straining against my bonds. His hand slaps me hard, making my butt sting. He pulls me upright, and tugs my chains. I bite my lips to remain silent, but I don't want to. "No moaning. And don't you dare come," he scolds.

I feel wicked. I say, "What makes you think I'll come for you?" with a grin on my face.

Suddenly the game changes. I don't get spanked for speaking. Instead, he holds onto the chains, riding me, and he works harder. He pushes into me again, and his hand reaches around to stroke my clit. I purr, thrusting my h*ps back harder. Oh God. I can't stop. I thrash against the ties around my wrists, but the belt won't give. I manage to bend the bar and gain another inch. I pull my elbows under me and push off the bench. My br**sts sway beneath me as I slam back into him.

Sweat makes my body slick with a bright sheen. His eyes are on mine, then on my br**sts as they bounce with each fuck. He never looks away from the mirror as his hand slides into my p**sy. He strokes me, pushing hard into my ass, pushing his entire hand into my p**sy. I moan, feeling like I'm about to come, but he yanks the chain, hard.

We're rocking, sweating, and f**king. I can't breathe. I can't stop. He rides me harder and harder. I can't believe this is him, and me. I can't stop. My p**sy tightens around his hand, as he pushes into my ass. I push back against his dick, against his hand. Before I know what I'm saying, I beg him, "Fuck me harder. Bite my neck."

He wraps the chains around his wrist. They pull at my tender flesh. My stomach twists and untwists. My p**sy is so hot and wet. I feel my body cli**x as he comes in my ass. His dick throbs, and I savor every moment. He pushes hard into me one last time, before pulling out and drops to his knees.

"No," I say. I was so close. I think he's going to leave me chained there and recover. But he doesn't. He drops to his knees and buries his face in my p**sy. He eats me, stroking me with his hands, pulling the chain and doesn't stop until I come in his mouth. I feel the pulsating begin, the delicious clenching and unclenching. It spirals through me and explodes in a shower of bliss. He swallows my come, licking his lips when he's done like he wants more.

I collapse on my stomach. I can barely breathe. He reaches for me, adjusts the ties on my ankles, and turns me over. His dick is hard again. I'm gasping for him to wait a second, but he doesn't. He pushes inside my p**sy. The angle makes me take him in deeper. He moans, thrusting inside of me. The chains on my body shake as he thrusts harder and harder.

I scream, "Harder baby, f**k me harder."

He stops, reaches for my legs and unties me. He pushes an ankle up and holds it there as he slides inside of me. His dick is so hard and so deep inside me. This position also gives him a full view of my face and my p**sy. His fingers wrap around the cl*t ring and he releases it, taking it off of me.

"No," I say. His hand comes down hard on my ass, spanking me.

"It wasn't part of the rules. Neither was coming a second time, so tell me, where do you want me to come? Or should I chose?"

My lip trembles, "I-"

Before I have time to think about it, he twists me back over. I lay on my stomach, my br**sts on the slick leather. I feel his hand inside my p**sy, pushing up into me. His other hand lands hard on ass, stinging. "Only speak when I tell you to. Only move when I say you can. You'll listen this time. Won't you?" He hits me twice more, once for each mistake. I say nothing. "Answer." He commands.

"Yes," I say, breathless, stinging wonderfully in some places, while clenching tightly in others.

He moves me to the bed and ties me down. Before he climbs on top of me, he grabs his tie. He moves to wrap it around my eyes, but I jerk away. His voice is tender, "Please, be a little more slutty for me? I'll make it worth your while." I let him cover my eyes. The world goes dark. I'm tied to my bed and blindfolded. My heart is racing, wondering what he'll do.

Before I have my head back on the pillow, I feel his tongue on my neck. I try to move beneath him, but I'm tied tighter this time. Then his lips are on mine. His mouth is hot. His slick body slides over mine and I feel his long hard erection on my leg. He parts my lips and pushes his dick into my p**sy. He's inside me again, pushing harder and faster, rocking both of us into ecstasy. I want to take my hands and dig my nails into his back. I want to scream out and say his name. A moan escapes from me and he stops.

Suddenly he pulls out and he's gone. I remain still, waiting for the sting of his hand. My legs are spread wide apart. Suddenly I feel the strike of his palm between my legs. The tender skin stings as the jolt reaches far into me, sending a series of pain and pleasure responses that baffle my brain. It makes no sense. It should hurt. I should cry, but I don't. I gasp again, and he strikes me a second time.

"You like that don't you ,baby?"

"Yes," I moan, arching my back, thrusting my br**sts up. I can't see him. I don't know where he is. My heart is racing wondering what he'll do next.

I feel his hands on the tie around my eyes, pulling it loose. He lowers it and looks me in the eye saying, "This for your own good." He gags me. I strain against the restraints holding my arms and legs in place, but I can't stop him. My heart races faster. He says, "I was going to come in your mouth, but your p**sy is so hot and wet. This is my second choice."

After he gags me, he lowers his body on top of mine and pushes slowly, deeply, inside of me. Over and over again, he draws his dick all the way out and then slams into me. I moan into the tie, but he doesn't stop to spank me. His fingers find their way between us and he pinches my clit. With each thrust he squeezes harder and harder. Soon, I'm bucking against him, desperate to come.

He says, "Oh yeah, f**k me baby. Push back."

We move together, his hand pressing hard on my clit. He lies on top of me, burying his dick as hard and as deep as he can. When I start to come, I scream into the gag. It makes him thrust faster and harder. He doesn't stop. His fingers tease my cl*t as his dick slams into me. I can't breathe. I'm so hot, so wet. He slides inside of me and shudders. He pushes one last time and I feel him shatter. His warmth fills me. His body remains tense as he comes, his eyes closed, his expression more animal than man, and I know he's not done.

He pulls out and lowers his lips to my br**sts. His tongue tries to suck me, but the chains are in the way. "I'm taking these off. They were very sexy before, but they're in the way now." I shake my head, but he says, "Yes, baby. Let me eat you. Let me lick you. I want every inch of you. It's what you offered and I plan on taking it."

I go still as he removes both chains. The collar slides off my neck as he undoes it. He unties me and flips me over, then secures the restraints again. I'm face-down on the bed, bound with his tie in my mouth. "I'm leaving you gagged, because I don't think you can be quiet for this either, and I don't want to stop and spank you every time you scream."

My face is sideways, away from him. He climbs on my back and starts kissing me. He trails his hot lips lower and lower, trailing kisses down my back. My stomach twists as my p**sy gets wet again. I want him to touch my br**sts, but he doesn't. I want him inside me, but he makes me wait. I moan, and strain against the bonds.

His hand lands hard on my ass. I jerk my head to look at him and he's grinning, "I had to. You're too beautiful not to spank thoroughly." His hand lands another blow, lighter this time. My p**sy sings with each strike, like that action alone could make me come. I feel hot and light, and I'm hyperaware of every inch of my body. Every kiss he's given me is tattooed on my skin. I try to turn my head, but he doesn't let me.

Instead, he spreads my legs apart and slides his dick inside my p**sy, pushing hard. "Lift your ass," he says. When I take too long, he pulls out and spanks me again. I pull my knees up, and he says, "Better. Stay like that or I'll punish you."

I fall back down on the bed, teasing him, wanting to see what he'll do. Without a word, he reaches one hand between my legs. He grabs my cl*t between his fingers and twists. I scream into the gag, pushing back against his hand. It hurt like hell, sending warring sensations throughout my body. Part of me screamed in pain, but it filled the other half of me with need, hot and heavy like I'd die if he didn't f**k me at that moment. There will never be enough of him, he can't push into me hard enough, fast enough. The desire flashes through my body, pulses in my p**sy and n**ples. As soon as he releases me, I want more.

He does it a second time, twisting and pinching my cl*t harder. Tears form in my eyes from the same intense pleasure that happened before. I need him inside me. I can't stand it. He rubs my butt and says, "Be a good girl. Ass in the air."

I resume the position he wants me in. He slides inside of me and f**ks me from behind. Each thrust is so deep that I don't think I can bear him. I feel his dick stretching my p**sy further and further. I cry out into the gag. He reaches under me and one hand finds my n**ples. He rolls the tender skin between his fingers. His other hand is on my clit, squeezing it, rolling it as he f**ks me from behind.

Fighting the desire to push back, I remain perfectly still. It makes it so I can feel everything, every delicious touch, every caress, more intensely. His fingers pull at my nipple, making it so hard to stay still. The sensation makes me p**sy clench against him as he pushes into me. Slowly he pulls out and then pushes in harder. Deeper, faster. He increases his speed while pinching my clit.

"Push back, baby."

And I do. My h*ps buck and I can't stop myself. I need him. I want him. We f**k like that until I feel my body begin to shudder and I know he's made me come again. He f**ks me harder as I begin to pulsate, burying his c*ck deeper and deeper. He slams into me and I moan as he fills me with come. When he's finished, I feel his dick. He's still inside of me. No one has ever made me feel like this before. I lay still, but he's not done. His hands wind around me and find my clit. He strokes me gently, occasionally clamping down so tight that his nails dig into my tender flesh. He kisses my neck while he does it. I lay face down on the bed, perfectly still, breathing hard, wondering what he wants next. His other hand slides up and down between my cl*t and my ass, pressing on the hole. His wet fingers slip inside my ass and I moan.

"Push back," his voice sounds perfectly sated. I push back against him and I can feel him smiling. He kisses the side of my face as I push my ass into his hand. He releases me and we lay together, his arms around me.

Silence fills the room. I feel sated and deliciously sore. Gently, he removes the tie from my mouth, and I lay down against him. His fingers are in my hair, stroking gently.

"Stay?" I ask, almost afraid to speak. His arms feel so good around me. I missed him so much. Everything from his touch to the sound of his voice was a comfort that I don't want to lose again.

"Really?" he asks, smiling softly. The steady stroke of his hand on my head pauses.

I look up at him, "Of course. There's no one else. There never has been." It's the answer to the questions he's been dying to ask.

"Same here," he breathes. "There never will be. You're the only one I want. The only one I'd want by my side."

"Ah, but for how long?" I joke, trying to make things light, but he has other ideas.

"Forever, Ash. Every day. Every hour. Even then, that wouldn't be enough. I need you." I shift in his arms and look up at him surprised, "I took that job with the orchestra knowing you were there. Gary wasn't sick-I asked to take his slot, hoping I could see you. Then after it was over, that first night, I couldn't find you. I thought you left, so I ran out to the street. It was luck that I saw you-well luck and that huge cello case. I practically ran down the street. There was no way I'd let you leave without saying anything. I had to know, if there was any chance of us being us again-I had to take it."

Tears stream down my face. I bite my lip, unsure what to say. It feels like I'll break the moment-that this is a dream and I'll wake up. Michael's voice breaks my thoughts, "Say something. You can talk, laugh, moan, or tell me off... just say something, Ash."

I sit up and smile at him, "I love you. I'll always love you. Forever isn't long enough to show you how I feel." I smile, snuggling against his chest, finally feeling whole after years of feeling lost. Before I know it, he's lying on top of me, covering me in kisses and showing me that he'll do anything I want, anything at all.

CHAPTER ONE

Rain splattered on the windshield of the cab in globs. Each splash sounded like a rock. I was used to nasty storms from living in Texas for so long, but it made the people who never left New York cringe. The cabbie was an oversized man with pasty skin and too much hair. He had a dark ball cap pulled down low, concealing his face. As we drove into the storm, he pushed his hat farther back, as if ball caps hindered vision. The man was leaning forward, practically pressing his face against the windshield.

We drove east in silence. He didn't try to make small talk, and I was glad about that. This homecoming wasn't something I wanted to discuss. I still didn't want to be here, but there was nowhere left to go. The car pulled off the expressway, and after a few turns, the cab rolled down a narrow street in Port Jeff. Through the rain, porch lights blazed promising warmth inside the rows of homes.

"Here we are," the cabbie stated with complete indifference. As he told me the total, he wrote something on a clipboard, and tossed it back onto the front seat next to him.

Hesitating for a moment, I looked up at the brown brick facade and swallowed. Maybe this wasn't a good idea. I'd left Long Island over ten years ago, and, although I missed it, I had never wanted to come back. Yet, here I was.

The cabbie cleared his throat, waiting. I blinked once, pushing away the doubt that crawled up my spine, and dug into my purse. It pained me to hand him the last of my money, but I did. He grumbled something, expecting me to be cheap because I looked like a drowned rat, but I said, "Keep the change."

"Sure thing, Princess. I'll buy a new yacht to park next to the other one." The man laughed. He sounded like a llama choking on a shoe. Fine. It wasn't a big tip, but it was all I had. I got the clear impression he didn't think Little Miss Texas should be wandering around big bad New York, like some redneck yokel who just discovered shoes.

Ignoring him, I slid off the seat. Kicking open the door, rain splattered down and I was instantly wetter. I didn't think that was possible. I had one bag with me and two others in the trunk. Drops of freezing rain ran down my neck and into my coat making me shiver. I'd forgotten how different men acted here. They didn't hold doors or help girls with their bags. After I ran around to the back of the cab, I grabbed my suitcases and slammed the trunk shut.

As the red taillights faded into the darkness, the front door of 6A opened. A young woman with long dark hair ran down the porch stairs and straight at me. "Abby!" In two bounds she was across the puddles, hugging me like I'd never left.

"Hey, Kate," I hugged her back. She didn't seem to care that I was sopping wet, and now, so was she. Holding my shoulders in her hands, she examined me under the street light. Her eyes were still vibrant, and every ounce as green as I remembered.

"I can't believe it's been so long since I've seen you," Kate said grinning, shaking her head. "I have no idea why you ran away and failed to tell your best friend about it, but I would have traded anything to get to see you again. And now you're here!" She hugged me again. I wasn't much of a hugger, and neither was she, but she was right. With the way I'd left, I didn't expect such a warm reception. "Come on, let's go inside. I have a spiked hot cocoa with your name on it." She reached for my bags, and then made a beeline for the front door with me on her heels.

Kate didn't know why I'd left, and I never told her. It was complicated. As I stepped over the threshold, I glanced around her apartment. It was warm and clean, decorated like an art gallery with beautiful artwork on the walls. The room was peaceful, painted with soft blues and browns-not like the girl with the bright orange bedroom she had when we were younger. Kate seemed to have gotten over her fascination with neon colors.

Pushing her dripping hair out of her face, Kate said, "Come on. I'll show you your room, and then we can catch up." Following Kate's path of puddles, I walked between the living room and kitchen to a back hallway. The apartment was larger than it appeared from the street. After passing a bathroom, I stopped in the doorway of a bedroom. Kate grabbed my bags from me, putting them under a window and throwing towels on the floor in front of them to soak up the water. "And this, Miss Abigail Tyndale, will be your residence for as long as you like."

"It'll only be a year, Kate. I'll go as soon as I can. I don't want to burden you." I felt horrible having to do this in the first place, and she was being so nice. Kate was the same selfless person from a decade ago. I bet she still dragged half dead cats off the street and took them to the vet, happily footing their medical bills and finding them a new home.

Kate folded her arms over her chest, and hung her head. "You're gonna run again, aren't you? First chance you get, you'll head for the hills and go back to no-mans land." It was a statement. An obvious observation. A dark tendril of hair clung to Kate's cheek, water dripping down her face like tears. Her green eyes were on me, wanting an answer.

No one willingly ran to no-mans land. I sure didn't and standing there with her, it felt like I'd never left. It felt like I had my best friend back, and I missed her. No one took her place in all the time I was gone. She was the kind of person who didn't say what you wanted to hear-she said what you needed to hear. Friends like her were rare.

I smiled at her, "This isn't my home anymore. I don't belong here." My moist clothing clung to me like wet toilet paper. I repressed a shiver. A hot shower really sounded divine.

"You belong with your family," she stated, stubbornly.

I wondered if she'd heard-if she knew. One night, several years ago, my parents were driving back from dinner and never got home. They were hit, head on, by a car going 90 miles per hour. Everything shattered. There was nothing left. No chance for survival. No chance to say good-bye. "They're all dead, Kate. I'm alone," I said softly staring at her.

She smiled sadly at me, "I know Abby, but that wasn't what I meant. Your friends are your family now. You're not alone, unless you choose to be." As she left my room, she said over her shoulder, "It's time to stop running."
