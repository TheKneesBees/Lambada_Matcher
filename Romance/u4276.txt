Chapter One

"Angus! You little shit!" I hobble across the kitchen, my still-damp hair plastered to the sides of my face and my tights knotted around my ankles. "Go away!" I swipe at my cat and he leaps from the counter.

I look at the now half-empty tin of tuna on the side. How he managed to get the lid off, I'll never know. It was only cracked open a little after I drained the juice.

"Seriously? I go to get dressed and you pilfer my dinner? What kind of cat are you?"

Angus looks at me, unaffected, and licks his paw. I stare at him in annoyance for a long moment before giving into the inevitable and tipping the remaining fish into his food bowl. He sticks his tail in the air triumphantly as he meanders across the room to it.

"Stupid animal," I mutter, reaching down and tugging up my tights.

Rrrrrip.

"Oh, you have got to be f**king kidding me!" I bend over and examine the rip snaking up my right calf. With a heavy sigh, I pull the tights off and throw them in the trash. The lid clangs down loudly, and Angus looks away from his food to shoot me a disdainful look.

I point at him. "This is all your fault, you know. I caught you stealing my tuna so had to run out here before I could put them on. Don't you know tonight is the night I could end up in Jackson's bed, hmm? And look at these." I stretch my leg out in front of him. "They're whiter than white."

My cat returns to his food. I drop my leg and head back into my room. Well, one good thing has come from this-if I do end up going home with Jackson tonight, it's one less obstacle in the way.

I run my hands up my legs, checking to see if I missed any spots when I shaved earlier. No stray hairs, thank God.

I keep half an eye on my grumpy cat as I grab the hairdryer and dry my hair. I wouldn't put it past him to do anything else... like open a cupboard to find more tuna. The damn animal has two thumbs, I'm f**king sure of it. The shit he can do is not normal.

By the time my hair is falling around my shoulders, dry, the cat in question is sitting at my kitchen table staring at me. I do my best to ignore him as I apply my makeup and get dressed in something more covering than my underwear.

My phone buzzes.

There are a million stores in this city and I still haven't found a rehearsal dinner dress. What's wrong with me?

I grin at my best friend's text message. That's what you get for choosing your wedding dress in Paris without me.

Whatever. We're looking for your dress soon. Behave tonight.

My smile drops. Shopping with Bridezilla? Oh, crap. Although, I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and admit Aaron is the one who picked the earlier date. Dayton only went along with it because he left all the major choices up to her... Which means he'll be finding himself wearing pink.

All is fair in love and war, I suppose.

I drop my phone into my purse knowing the last words of her message will be disregarded. Given that Jackson, my ex-manager, is my number one man crush for, like, ever, behaving is the last thing on my mind tonight.

Today is his birthday, and I plan to help him finish his day with a bang. Preferably a hot and sweaty one that finishes up with an orgasm.

Really, it's not much to ask for.

"You," I pause at the door and point at Angus, "Stay out of trouble. I don't want to come back and find you humping a lady cat again. Are we clear?"

He mews pathetically and turns away from me. I roll my eyes and head downstairs to my waiting cab. I'm already running a bit late thanks to the tuna fiasco-okay, so I was running late before that happened, but it's so much easier to blame my cat.

Downtown Seattle is thriving as we drive in. The window of the cab is cracked open a little and I can hear the happy shouts and laughs of groups of people as we come to a stop. We're stuck in some traffic, and I tap my foot agitatedly.

I lean between the seats and try to get a glimpse at how bad it is. "Do you know how long we'll be stuck here?" I ask the driver.

He shakes his head. "No, darlin', sorry," he rasps in a heavy smoker's voice. "There was a crash just outside the Southfall earlier today. Last I heard the cops were still sniffing around there."

"Great." I blow out a long breath. "Listen, I'm running late. Do you mind if I get out here?"

"Are you sure? I think it could be starting to move."

"No, no. I'll get out now." I dig my hand into my purse and pull out two tens. "Here. Keep the change."

"Sure you'll be alright, darlin'?"

"It's only a block away." I smile and push the door open. "Thanks."

I push it shut behind me and step onto the sidewalk. A wolf whistle echoes behind me and I roll my eyes, reaching for my ringing cell at the same time. What is it tonight?

"Hello?"

"Liv," my agent's voice comes through the speaker. "Where are you?"

"Downtown. I'm having a few drinks with the guys from the wine bar."

"Great. I'm just calling to let you know you have a shoot on Thursday."

"Really?" I scoot round a group of girls hogging the sidewalk. "For who?"

"It's a trial for Victoria's Secret. Since Luisa left last month, they've been holding secret shoots around the country, and I got you one of the last in the North West."

I stop in the middle of the street. My jaw nearly hits the floor. Did she just say what I think she did? "Victoria's Secret?"

"Yes. It's tough competition. Mr. Stone pulled some strings and is having you photographed by one of our photographers instead of theirs."

"Great." I look up and notice I'm standing outside the club I'm meeting everyone in. "Shall I come in on Monday to get all the details?"

"Yes, do. Have fun tonight. Bye, Liv." Sheila clicks off.

I take a deep breath before I enter the club and my head is assaulted by the incessant pounding of heavy music. It's still early but that doesn't matter-I still have to shimmy my way through groups of people with yells of, "Excuse me! Sorry!" to reach the stairs to take me to the second floor bar.

It's blessedly empty on the short stairwell, and I take a deep breath. Man, I'm getting too old for this clubbing shit.

I move into the second floor. This one is emptier than downstairs, and immediately I find my ex-colleagues at the bar. All of them have a glass of wine in their hands, surprisingly, and it's Amy who notices me first.

"Liv! Liv's here! Jackson, pour her a glass of wine."

I accept her hug and turn to Jackson. His light green eyes seem to smile at me as he hands me the glass and stands.

"Thanks," I take the drink from him and perch on his empty stool. His eyes comb over my body approvingly, and a low tingle starts in my lower stomach.

"You're welcome."

I turn away with a smile. Everyone knows sleeping with your boss is a bad idea... but he's not technically my boss anymore. So he's fair game. Right?

He certainly doesn't look like he wants to not sleep with me, that's for sure.

"Right," Leanne says, looking around at us all. "Can we please get this party started now?"

***

My head is a little fuzzy. My feet are kinda hurting, too. I wish I could whip off these god-awful heels and prance around barefoot for the next ten minutes, but that would be undignified.

Woops.

I lick my spilled wine from the back of my hand and giggle to myself. Dignity-schmignity. Clearly I left mine at home. Or maybe it ran away in the restroom. Who knows?

Perhaps it never existed.

I giggle again.

"Someone's had their fair share of wine tonight." Jackson slides into the seat across the table from me, his light hair mussed and sticking up. He shoots me a dazzling smile.

"It's your birthday. Celebration, right?"

He mock-pouts. "Celebrating what? Me being a year older?"

I pat his hand across the table. "You're only as young as the woman you feel." I wink.

"How's the new job?"

My stomach drop at his diversion. "It's good. My new manager gives me the hours and flexibility I need."

He raises his hands in the air in defense. "The orders came from the powers that be. I just did what I was told."

I try not to put my lingering annoyance in my gaze. Truth is, I love the wine bar. I worked there for three years, and I never wanted to leave. But they wouldn't adjust my hours so my days are free for modelling, and it's vital I have that option.

Especially now. If the next few shoots go well, especially the one my agent called about earlier, then I won't have to work in a bar at all.

I hold onto this thought as I finish the rest of my wine and set the glass on the table.

"Do you want another?" Jackson motions to the empty glass and I shake my head.

"Not right now. Thanks, though." I smile and he returns the gesture. Our eye contact lingers, and just when I think he's going to-

"Do you know where the others went?" he asks.

My stomach drops again. Apparently I'm not finding my way to his bed tonight either.

"Nope," I reply. My tone is noticeably clipped, and Jackson pauses before he stands.

"Okay. I'll go find them. Will you wait here?"

"No, I think I'm going to head home. Say bye to everyone for me, will you?"

He nods and runs a hand through his hair. "Sure." He bends down and presses a kiss to my cheek. "I miss you at work, you know?"

Not enough to f**k me.

Still, I smile. "I miss you, too, but we all have to move on at some point, right? We can't do something or stay somewhere just because it makes us comfortable."

"Too true. Take care of yourself, Liv."

"You, too."

I watch as he walks away from me, the thought it could be the last time I see him twisting in my lower stomach. Yes, I have a huge crush on the guy, but he's still my friend. I'll definitely have to stop by the bar when I have a night off to say hi to everyone.

I sigh and run my finger around the top of my glass. My eyes close to the pounding music. My foot is tapping beneath the table, and for a moment I just sit and listen to the words as they flow over me.

The table moves slightly and I open my eyes, expecting it to be Jackson again or one of the girls.

It's not.

Oh, boy, it's not.

Sitting in front of me is an incredible specimen of a man. No, never mind that. Sitting in front of me is the hottest f**king guy I've ever seen in my life.

He gives definition to tall, dark, and handsome. From the dark hair swept back and curling over his ears to eyes I can't make out the color of, he's completely f**king gorgeous.

I'm mesmerized by him.

Shapely lips quirk to one side as he appraises me in the same manner, and he sits forward in his seat, running his thumb across his jaw. "Hi."

Is that-"Hi."

He motions to my empty glass. "Can I get you a drink?"

Holy f**k, yes it is. It's a British accent.

Goodbye, panties. See you on the other side... of his bed.

I look at it and up to him. Maybe another is on the cards after all. I lick my lips and meet his eyes. "Sauvignon, please."

He winks and grabs my glass. I watch as he walks to the bar, confidence radiating off him. It's like an aura around him. He's shit hot and he knows it, but he's not arrogant about it.

Okay, the way he leans against the bar and shoots a panty-melting smile at the girl working it is kind of arrogant, but it's that sexy arrogant.

I'd probably be a little arrogant if I had an ass that tight, to be honest. His jeans fit him perfectly, not too tight and not too baggy... just enough that I can see the curve of his ass. And watch it. Yep. Oh boy am I watching it.

He turns and I find myself staring at his zipper instead. If only I was telekinetic, that bitch would be undone right about now.

I let my eyes linger there for a moment longer before trawling them up his body. I'm staring, unashamed, and I don't give a shit. My brazenness is fueled by wine and hormones. A lot of.

His blue and yellow checkered shirt hugs his waist and stretches over his shoulders. His sleeves are rolled to just below his elbow, but the material is tight enough I can see his biceps flexing as he sets down our drinks.

He sits, smirking, and leans back in his chair. "Good night?"

"It got better when you showed up," I reply, taking my glass and sipping.

His smirk grows, just a little. "A woman who speaks her mind. It must be my lucky night."

Keep talking and it will be, honey. "Depends how you define lucky."

His eyes flash with something I can't put my finger on, and he leans forward on the table once more. He cups his chin and rubs his thumb over his bottom lip as he studies me.

My eyes fall to his mouth. He has the kind of lips I wouldn't mind kissing all day-plump, pink, soft-looking. The kind of lips that could cause some damage...

He stands and walks around the table to me. Taking my hands, he pulls me up to stand. His eyes search mine, and he steps forward, bringing our bodies closer.

"Do you dance?" he asks, his voice low.

I tilt my head back to meet his eyes. "Do you?"

His lips curve enticingly, and he wraps an arm around my waist. His hand on the small of my back, he jerks me against him and lowers his mouth to my ear. "You show me your moves, and I'll show you mine. How's that for a deal, babe?"

"Sounds fun." I hook my finger in one of his belt loops and step back, tugging him with me. "Come on, then."

We walk up the stairs to the dance floor, my fingers linked around his so we don't get separated. It's darker and louder than downstairs and there are bodies everywhere.

Every. Where.

Writhing. Grinding. Shaking. Undulating.

They move in time to the music, and it takes only seconds for the vibrations of the beat to snake their way over my skin and sink in.

I let go of his hand and grab his shirt. One tug and he's against me. "Show me what you've got, handsome."

That smirk curves his lips again, slowly and sexily. He grabs my hips and pushes me into the mass of hot bodies, following me. His fingers flex against me, and using that as momentum, I sway my hips from side to side.

The movements are flowing and easy, soon taking my whole body with them. Within seconds, he steps closer and curves his hands around to my back and over my ass. He cups it, pulling me closer again.

Our bodies are completely together, mine moving, his still. My hips rub his and my br**sts brush his chest, our proximity and the hardness of his body puckering my ni**les inside my bra.

Hot damn, he's solid.

I flatten my hands against his chest to feel it properly. There's nothing but hard muscle beneath my fingertips. Hard, hot muscle.

My breath catches in my throat when he lowers his face close to mine. Heat covers my mouth as his lips hover there, waiting. I slide a hand up to his neck and he takes it as an invitation.

He touches his lips to mine. They're exactly like I thought-soft and warm. They move with mine with ease and finesse, testing my response to him. I flick my tongue out against his bottom lip and his responding groan buzzes across my mouth.

He sucks lightly on my bottom lip and sweeps his tongue across it. Then he nudges at the seam of my lips, asking me to open for him, and I do.

The gentleness of just moments ago is gone. His tongue meets mine in a flick of forcefulness and I whimper at the unexpected sensation. Gripping his collar with one hand and clasping the back of his neck with the other, I push my body into his, still dancing.

His growing erection is obvious against my stomach. The same attraction is flooding through me, igniting red hot sparks of lust through my veins.

His kiss is strong and hard and I feel it everywhere, buzzing through my bloodstream, tingling the ends of my nerves, shuddering across my skin. His hands massage my ass firmly, thumbs digging in and his fingers teasing the high hem of my dress.

Oh, shit. His fingertips brush the tops of my thighs. I shudder, my pu**y clenching hard at the suggested touch.

"You move well," he says into my ear. His voice is low and husky and tingling all through me.

"Not so bad yourself," I murmur, knowing he can't hear me over the music. "You haven't convinced me yet," I say, louder, right into his ear.

He spins me sharply and pulls my back against his front. His erection pushes into my lower back, the bottom of it nudging the top of my ass, and I gasp at the contact.

He flattens one hand against my stomach, effectively trapping me against him. His other hand travels from my hip up to my breast and he cups it boldly. His fingers brush over where my already-taut ni**les are, making them ache almost painfully.

"Let's see what I can do about that." He nips my earlobe and drops his mouth to my neck. "Dance for me, beauty," he demands.

My breathing is faster than before, my chest burning with its speed. I am both thankful and fearful of the darkness. Thankful because we're invisible... fearful because that gives him freedom to do whatever he wants without anyone knowing.

That fear sends an erratic thrill through my body.

This man behind me, sexy as sin with a voice to match, could do anything to me here in this club, and no one would know. He could slide his fingers inside me. He could lift me against him and f**k me. He could demand I drop to my knees and suck his cock.

The music would swallow my cries. The dancing would meld with our own erotic routine.

The darkness would hide our sins.

Another thrill, stronger and more confident, hits me. I reach behind me and twine my fingers into his dark hair, moving my body against his once more. He moves his hand from my stomach to my other breast and caresses in time with the music.

His lips, hot and intense against me, buzz across my neck slowly. He interrupts them with nips and sucks, soothing with this tongue.

My body reacts to this stranger intensely. I want more. I want his hands beneath my dress and I want nothing between us.

My clit aches insanely, begging for his touch.

He moves his kisses to the other side of my neck and I moan quietly. His c**k is bigger and harder now, digging into my back temptingly. I reach behind us and cover it with my fingers, closing my eyes at the feel of him beneath my palm.

I stroke slowly, running my fingers over him. He strains against his pants and I want even more than just before.

"Undo the button," he orders into my ear. "Undo the button and touch me properly."

I don't hesitate.

I ease my hand behind us and inside his clothing. My thumb finds him first, the tip of his c**k wet with pr**cum. I rub it over him slowly before reaching for more.

My awkward position makes it hard to wrap my hand around him fully, so I simply run my fingers up and down his shaft.

He curses into my neck and drops one of his hands to the apex of my thighs. "Let me show you mine."

He sneaks his hand beneath my dress and nudges my legs open. I ease them open enough for him to touch me, and he does, running his fingers over my lace briefs.

"Shit. You're so wet."

One finger slips beneath my panties and I gasp at the ease he pushes it into me with. I swallow hard as he adds a second and f**ks me slowly with his hand.

"Feel how tight you are? Shit. If you feel this good around my fingers, I can't imagine what it'll be like when it's my c**k inside you."

Fuck. I clench around his fingers.

Never have I been so exposed, so out in the open for anyone to discover.

"Do you think you can come from my fingers?" His voice cuts through the music and sends tremors through me. "Do you think you'll come hard enough you'll scream?"

Dirty talk has never sounded as good as it does with a British accent.

"Well?" he pushes, holding his fingers inside me and curving the tips of them.

My whole pu**y throbs and I grip his cock. "Find out," I challenge, holding my moan in my throat.

He laughs. It's a low sound, one that washes over me and does crazy stupid things to my body.

Then he's pulling my hand from his pants and setting it over his. "Feel how easily I'm about to make you come."

With my hand over his, he drives his fingers into me quickly. Using only his wrist to control his movements, he teases my pu**y and pushes me closer to the edge.

His movements are short and sharp, hard and heavy, and I drop my head back against his shoulder. I grip his hair tighter and in turn, he fists mine and turns my face to the side.

He kisses me as firmly as his fingers f**k me and in a swath of heat, I cry into his mouth. The orgasm hits and he catches me before my knees buckle.

"That easily." He withdraws his fingers from me and spins me, still holding me against him as I come down from my high.

He brings his fingers to his mouth and sucks them. His eyes are on mine the whole time, and I stare, still trying to work out what color they are.

Hazel, maybe?

"Convinced?"

I lean up and seal my mouth over his. The taste of me lingers on his lips, and I purposely lick it off. "Convinced you need to buy me a drink."

He laughs again and buttons his pants. "You got it."

We leave the dance floor with his arm securely around my waist. And I'm reeling-my mind is spinning out of control.

I've known him ten minutes and he's already made me come.

More than that, I sense he's a risk. He's a f**k you and leave you kind of guy. You don't get to know him, not even his name. All you'll know by the time the sun rises is how well he can f**k you.

Fuck you and leave you guys are the kind I should stick with. No obligations or expectations of tomorrow. They're my favorite. All they want to know is where my condoms are and that's cool with me.

But this f**k you and leave you guy is different. He's more confident than I thought, to the point of whispering dirty things into a stranger's ear. He's an enigma, a puzzle to be solved, a mystery to unravel.

There's more to him than meets the eye. Seconds after meeting and he took charge. Demanding I put my hand inside his pants and touch him. Recklessly sliding his own beneath my dress and toying with me until I come over his fingers.

For certain, he's dangerous. And this is good and bad for me.

Danger is my best friend and my enemy.

This man, this dirty British boy, whoever he may be, is a temptation. One I plan to fully indulge in.

Once I've pushed it a little further.

Chapter Two

I take the glass of wine from his hand. Our fingers brush and I meet his eyes. He nods over to a corner and I follow him, keeping on his heels as we weave through the tables and booths.

The table is empty but he pulls me onto his lap. I straddle him, his arm around my waist keeping me steady on top of him.

My pu**y is firm against his cock, and the teasing pressure is begging me to rub against him.

"What do you do?" he asks, swigging from his beer bottle.

"A job," I answer cryptically. "You?"

"The same." Lips. Smirk. "Do you enjoy it?"

"Do you?"

"Do you typically answer a question with a question?"

"Do you typically ask a woman you're planning to f**k about her life?"

"Touche."

I tilt my glass with a triumphant smile and sip. "I didn't think so."

He watches me as I drink. Watches as my lips curve around the glass and part to let the wine into my mouth, and he sure as shit watches when my tongue flicks out to lick up the moisture.

"I love your lips," he murmurs, putting his bottle down and raising his hand to my mouth. "They're so soft... so sweet... I'm going crazy thinking about all the things you could do with them."

His thumb ghosts across my bottom lip, the roughness of it burning me almost. I part my lips and flick my tongue against his thumb, watching his eyes flash with renewed desire.

He takes my wine, sets it down, and pulls me closer into him. "Are you here alone?"

"Yes."

"Don't look," he says against my jaw. "But there's a man by the bar whose expression says differently."

"What does he look like?" I want to look. Fuck, I want to look.

"Light hair. Wearing a white shirt. Six foot two, maybe."

Jackson. "Don't worry about him." I curve my hand around his neck and tilt my face into his.

"Ex?"

"Someone who didn't take his chance when it existed."

"Aahhhh." My stranger turns his face to mine and slides a hand up my back. "Looks like he didn't get the memo, babe."

"So give him it."

His lips twitch into a smile just before he kisses me. His kiss is rough, rougher than before. It screams of possession, of a temporary ownership that coils through my body and only winds me tighter.

He bites my bottom lip and tugs it, further showing that dominance, this time to me. It should hurt, it should make me whimper in pain, but it doesn't. It sends a bolt of desire between my legs and makes me respond to his kiss more vigorously.

My ex-boss is forgotten as thoughts of what this stranger could do to me fill my mind. He's strong and commanding. He's already shown me he's not afraid to tell me what he wants from me or indeed, what he's going to do to me.

He's aware of his ability, and maybe even of the raw sexuality that comes off him.

He's certainly aware that he can kiss like no man's business.

"Would it be rude of me to grab your hand and pull you out of here right in front of him?" he rasps into my ear. "Because you're rubbing that tight pu**y against my c**k and I'm five seconds away from unbuttoning my trousers and f**king you right here."

I take a deep breath. My stomach is tight with need. "Not rude at all."

"Perfect," he murmurs, kissing me once more before helping me stand. He digs into his pocket and pulls out a wallet. He opens it, grabs a card, and hands it to me.

I take the card from his hand and look at it. Room card.

"This is the key to room 501 at the hotel across the road." He runs his fingers along my jaw and tilts my chin up. "Meet me there in ten minutes."

"I get the feeling this isn't your first rodeo." I raise an eyebrow.

"No, it isn't, but it isn't yours either, is it?"

"Touche."

He acknowledges it with a tilt of his head. "Ten minutes. Room 501."

With those words he steps back and disappears. I draw in a long, needing breath and tuck the card into my purse. Somehow it hasn't got tangled in our clinches, and I'm wishing I packed a spare pair of panties.

The ones I'm wearing are f**ked.

His words are still echoing in my mind when my wrist is grabbed and I'm turned around. "I thought you were going home."

I stare at Jackson. "I was. I got waylaid."

He glances at my purse. "Looks like you're not getting back on track any time soon."

"We all need a little detour when the mood strikes us."

"It's not the only mood striking you tonight."

"Do you have a problem, Jackson? Because you're sure f**king dancing around something."

"You don't know the guy," he says, pulling me over to the bar.

I yank my hand from his grip and stare at him. "All the better for me, then. Is that it or can I go now?"

He stares at me for a long moment. His jaw tics but he doesn't say anything, so I turn.

"Go out with me."

"Excuse me?" I look over my shoulder, my eyes wide.

"Go on a date with me."

I wanted to f**k you, not date you, you moron.

"I'm about to go and sleep with another guy and you're asking me on a date?"

His jaw clenches.

"You're a fool," I say before walking away.

I push my way downstairs and out of the club. Go on a f**king date indeed.

Dates aren't my thing. In fact, they're as far f**king from it as they could be. Dates are full of lovey, mushy get-to-know you bullshit. They build a relationship on the person inside, on emotion, and for me, on potential addiction.

The more I know about a person the more likely I'll get addicted to them.

Take my ex-fuck buddy. All I knew about Ross was his name, his number, his address, and what size condom he needed.

That's all you need to know about a person.

And tonight I don't even need that. Hell, I don't even need Mr. Tall, Dark, Handsome and Oh So British's number.

I just need the hotel room and his c**k and we'll be right on track.

I push the thoughts of dating and addictions to the back of my mind. That's the purpose of the one night stands, after all. To avoid the possibility of addiction. And the man waiting for me, the dangerous love 'em and leave 'em man, is the perfect guy to scratch my clit's itch.

I walk into the lobby of the hotel like I'm meant to be here and head for the elevators. Once inside, I locate the floor room 501 is on and press the corresponding floor button. I run my fingers through my hair and wipe a small black smudge from my eye using the mirrored walls, and the doors open with a swooshing sound.

I step out and make my way down the hall. The door to room 501 opens and my British stranger fills the doorway.

"Good timing," I say, looking into his eyes.

His dark brown eyes.

They're soft like melted chocolate, but the glint is dangerous. It's almost black. It's tempting, hiding something that's begging to be uncovered.

"Let's just say I saw you coming." He smirks.

I raise an eyebrow but don't press it. "Are you inviting me in or are you keeping me in the hall?"

He opens the door and steps to the side. I walk inside with his eyes on me. Hotter than in the club, he runs his gaze over my body and doesn't stop even when I turn. I throw my purse on the sofa and wait for him to make the move.

I'm not used to waiting. I'm not used to standing back while someone else takes control, because it's never usually about the guy. The one nights are about me and me getting what I need.

But this... I know instinctively that pressing him won't work.

His commanding presence, his dark eyes, his smirking lips... The steadiness of his stride as he approaches me... These things tell me he's a man who's used to being in control.

A man who craves control.

And despite me usually being in control in bed, I crave the opposite.

I crave to be controlled.

I crave to let go entirely, to surrender to someone else's desires. My life is constant control. It's a constant fight against the inevitable. I spend every day toeing the line to protect myself, to keep the control I so desperately want to give up.

And he... He could give me that.

I can feel it.

I tilt my face up to meet his gaze. His eyes flare with heat and I step into him without thinking. He has a pull on me, a sexual pull I can't fight.

Shit, I want to see what else this man can do to me.

He lowers his face to mine. His lips crash into mine with fervor, and he pulls me into him. His hands slide down my back and over my ass once more, holding me closer.

I can feel every ridge of his body. My hands are pressed against his stomach, my thumbs close to the buttons of his shirt. I can feel the heat through the thin material and I want to touch him without it. So I move my hands and undo the buttons, working my way down, brushing his hard c**k with the backs of my fingers when I'm done.

I splay my fingers across his toned stomach and he groans low. He tugs at the hem of my dress, walking me backward. His fingers work my dress until it's around my waist and he drops his hands once more, cups my thighs, and lifts me.

My legs wrap around his waist and he carries me into another room. There, he sets me down, making sure my core rubs his c**k as he does. I gasp, and he breaks the kiss and yanks the dress over my head. It falls to the floor as he looks my body over, his chest rising and falling.

Goosebumps erupt across my skin as his eyes linger on my chest. With a shrug, his shirt falls away, exposing broad shoulders and shapely biceps. His lips purse as he exhales slowly and before I can think, his hands are in my hair and his lips are descending on mine once more.

His kiss is hot and hurried, his tongue desperately sweeping my mouth and tasting every inch of me. My tongue flicks against his as he tugs my hair, pushing me down against the bed.

My hands move across his stomach and around to his back, loving the smooth heat of his skin. He releases my hair and pulls back. He lowers his hand to the clasp of my bra and unclips it, pushing my bra away and freeing my br**sts.

He cups them, this time skin on skin, and I inhale at the sensation. He brushes his thumbs across my ni**les, hardening them instantly, and when his lips buzz down my neck, my back arches.

His thumbs teasing my ni**les and his mouth against my skin is a heady combination.

Then his mouth replaces his thumb and it's his tongue rubbing across my sensitive skin, and I moan.

"Mmm." The sound vibrates against me as he trails his mouth to my other breast. "You have gorgeous tits. Tell me, babe, does your cunt taste as sweet as they do?"

Holy hell. I moan again and push my hips up. My pu**y is achingly wet. My legs curve around his waist and I push myself against him again. My hips grind, feeling the hardness of him against my softness.

He pulls his mouth from me, lets go of my br**sts, and slides his hands down my body. They reach my hips and he grips, stilling me. His fingers dig in to my skin, a sweet pressure.

"You can do that later. Now, though, I'm intrigued by your taste."

His fingers hook inside my panties and slowly, teasingly, tantalizingly, he pulls them down my legs. He grips my ankle and kisses it, humming low as his lips drag up the inside of my thigh.

"Now, you can f**k my face."

I gasp again when he drops to his knees, my legs falling with him. I've never met anyone so achingly blunt about sex or what they want. Every word sends thrills down my spine to my core. Every sentence wraps around me and turns me the f**k on.

Those thoughts are silenced when he spreads my legs. A chill falls over me, but it lasts just seconds before he runs his tongue along my pu**y. From my opening to my clit, he moves along me in one long lick. He groans, and I wonder if he knows how hard his fingers are digging into my thighs.

But I don't care. I like it. I more than like it.

He works his tongue, sliding it back and forth across me, slipping it between my folds. The tip of his tongue flicks as he moves, adding extra pleasure, and my hips move with him. Against him.

I writhe, my hands reaching down to fist his hair and hold him against me. My legs tighten and he pushes his tongue right inside of me. I have no idea what he's doing but it's crazy.

Heat covers me, my body is tight with tension and anticipation, and I need-

His thumb against my clit, rubbing and pushing, and the release.

My legs clench around his neck as my pu**y clamps down on his tongue. I moan loud, trembling as the orgasm rips through me.

He releases me and my legs fall limply down. The sound of a zipper undoing fills the air and I force my head up to see him pulling his pants down.

His underwear follows and his c**k springs free. Pre-cum glints on the end and I lick my lips. I want to move forward, to take him in my mouth. Taste him.

He smirks and rolls a condom on slowly. I don't know where it came from, but I don't care. His hand slides to the base of his dick and he comes back to me, grabbing my hips.

"What-oh!"

He pushes me up the bed, his lips still curved, his eyes never leaving mine. "Lift your legs."

Lift my-what?

He grabs my ankles and rests them on his shoulders. My eyes widen as his c**k nudges my opening. His hands grip my thighs as he pushes inside me.

I resist, if only because he's bigger than he looks, and reach for him.

He shakes his head and grabs my hands, holding them to the sides, keeping them pinned against the bed. "You don't touch me," he orders huskily. "You lie back and you let me f**k you. But no touching."

I inhale sharply and try to nod, but he slams into me hard and I drop my head back. Fuck. He fills me entirely, his c**k buried deeply inside me.

"Good. Now I'm going to f**k you and you're going to come, and you're going to come f**king hard. Understood?"

Holy f**king hell. "Yes," I breathe, my legs opening to take him further.

His pace is relentless, every pound inside me harder than the last. His balls slap against me and he releases my hands to grab my ass.

"Hands on your thighs," he demands, tilting my hips up.

I do as he says and grip my thigh as the angle of my hips allows him deeper, further...

He spanks me sharply and I cry out loudly at the connection. Then his hand is there, massaging, the softness out of place with how hard he f**ks me.

"Like that?" he asks, slapping me again.

My answer is a moan.

I do. I love it.

Every thrust inside me is a rush of heat and building pleasure, each stroke teasing my pu**y and making it tighten around him.

"Shit. Come here." He pulls out of me and pulls me up. He sits in the chair next to the bed and like he did in the bar, grabs my ass and tugs me on top of him.

My knees settle by his hips, and he releases my ass to reach between us and guide himself back inside.

My fingers barely brush his chest before he twists them behind my back and holds them together with one hand.

Desire rushes through me as he flexes his hips into me. This is slower but just as hard, and I want to touch him, want to pull him closer, make him move faster, push me over the edge, but I can't.

His hands holding mine means I can do nothing but kneel here and let him f**k me however he wants.

I'm helpless to my pleasure.

I breathe out a series of moans as he f**ks me right. I want to tell him there, right there, don't stop, but all that comes out is a cry of pleasure. His hand connects with my ass again and it just makes me hotter, wetter, more needing for the end.

He pulls me forward and drives into me faster. "You have a gorgeous pu**y. Tight and wet. It's perfect," he whispers into my ear. "And you like it rough, don't you, babe? You love it when I spank your arse and f**k you hard, don't you?"

"Yes," I reply, dropping my forehead to his shoulder.

"I can feel you tightening around my cock. Do you want to come? You feel like you do. Do you want me to f**k you harder?"

I gasp as he does, fully pushing his hips up. And he moves, faster and harder and deeper.

I tremble and every muscle in my body clenches. Heat, sweet heat, explodes through my veins and I scream.

I actually f**king scream as the orgasm hits and rips through me violently. I clamp down on him, my nails digging into his hand still restraining me. Still he moves, still he pounds, until his own groan mingles with my weakening cries.

It's still pulsing through me as he lifts me off him and sets me on the bed. I can still feel my pu**y clenching weakly, the muscle spasms making the pleasure linger longer than it should.

I drop back on the bed and cover my face with my hand. The bed creaks and dips and he leans over me.

I look into his eyes and he drops his mouth to mine.

"I don't usually say this," he murmurs, kissing along my jaw. "But I'm going to shower, and I wouldn't be annoyed if you were still here after."

He gets up, leaving me staring dumbly after him.

A one-night stand inviting me to stay longer? That's a first.

I stare at the bathroom door long after he disappears, his words echoing through my mind. I wouldn't be annoyed if I was still here when he gets out, either, but I know how bad that is.

One more f**k like that and I might not be able to walk out here by the end of it.

I still don't move.

As much as I should leave, I'd be dumb to walk away from sex this good.

I push myself up and walk to the bathroom. Steam fills the room, and the panes surrounding the large shower in the corner are condensed with heat, tiny water droplets running down.

I pull the shower door open and slip inside. "Do you mind?" I ask when he turns.

"Not at all." He reaches for me, his hand coiling around the back of my neck, and pulls my mouth to his.

I step under the spray of water with him and reach between us for his still-hard cock. I curl my fingers around him and stroke softly, the water acting as a lubricant for the action.

His tongue strokes mine as easily as my hand strokes along his shaft. He grows steadily even harder in my grip, and my body vibrates with the groan he releases. His fingers dig into my neck and my back as I work him.

The hot water sprays over us and my eyes sting as my mascara runs. I squeeze them shut tightly as I realize getting in the shower was a dumb idea. Nobody likes panda eyes.

He lets go of me for a second, stopping the kiss, and I feel a sponge against my eyes. I release him and laugh, taking it from it to rub my eyes. I open them and he's grinning, looking down at me with amusement and lust mixing in his eyes.

I return his smile and drop the sponge when the sting has gone.

"Better," he murmurs over the thunder of the water, turning and pressing me against the cold wall.

The chill of the ceramic against my hot wet skin sends a jolt through me. His hands slide down my body and he kisses my neck, sucking lightly on my pulse point. I wrap my arms around his neck as he lifts me.

His c**k nestles against my center, the hardness teasing my clit into a dull throb. I drop my hand between us and position his head against me. He pushes up into me, the lingering wetness from my orgasm giving him easy entrance.

He holds me tightly as he f**ks me once more. The slickness of sweat and water on our bodies makes our skin slick together. I'm still tender so I know it won't be long until I release again, until my body convulses and contracts around him.

It hits sooner than I thought. He nips my neck and I cry loudly into his ear as the second orgasm overcomes me. He moves until he reaches his own release and groans into my shoulder.

He holds me against the wall, our chests rising and falling in tandem, for a minute. I take a deep breath and push at his shoulders. My skin is on fire from both the orgasm and his touch.

He has the kind of touch a girl could get used to. One that sends both buzzes and lightning bolts across your skin, igniting pleasure and desire with just a light brush of his fingertips.

And that means I have to get out of here... now.

My stranger releases me and I step around him. I push open the door and step out the shower, reaching for a fluffy towel on the rail attached to the wall. My legs are trembling but that doesn't stop my run out of the bathroom.

I dry myself off harshly. The towel burns my skin with the pressure, and I pull on my wet panties and retrieve my bra from the bed. I clasp it and squeeze my hair with the towel as I search for my dress. I find it on the floor at the other side of the bed and snatch it up. I tug it over my head.

My wet hair sticks to my face but I push it away. My shoes are lying by the sofa. I don't remember them coming off at any point, but they're there. I shove my feet inside them and grab my purse.

The shower is still running, but I pull the door open without a second glance. I leave it to close behind me and escape into the safety of the elevator, away from the man with the sexiest voice I've heard in a long time.

Away from the man whose touched closer to my addiction than anyone has in a long time.

I pull a hair tie from my purse and pull my hair into a scruffy bun at the top of my head. In the lobby, I walk through without the receptionists looking up.

My heart is pounding, my body still coming down from three orgasms in quick succession, but I pay it no mind as I climb into a taxi waiting outside.

I don't give a crap who it belongs to. Just that it's there and it's going to get me away from here.

I lean back in the seat as the driver pulls away and blow out a long breath.

Love addictions aren't easy. It's more than just the feeling of being in love. It's everything that goes along with it, and I can't help but want it all. It's a constant war because I know the dangers of the addiction, what it can drive you to.

I know how it can hurt.

I pinch the bridge of my nose with my thumb and finger and count myself lucky I never got his name. I count myself lucky he never got mine.

One look at him and you know he has money-the kind of money that means you could track anyone down if you felt so inclined.

Just like we were when we met two hours ago, we are strangers, brought together by a wild attraction. The only thing that's changed is our knowledge of the other's body.

And now I never have to see him again.
