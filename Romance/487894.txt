Hard love

Love, belonging, differences


1

	Henrietta Fishburne couldn’t have enough of scrutinizing her little daughter’s face when she was holding the five-week-old Loretta in her arms. What did she inherit from her and what from Laurence in her look? She laughed in a low voice when it came into her head that she used to scrutinize this same thing on the little Heni too when she was a baby, and she loved think of the younger little girl’s twin, Laurence, that way that he was made of us too: made of the man she loved and of herself.

- I love that our child there is in me! – Heni began to speak happily, stroked her expectant belly, stood to her tiptoe and kissed her husband’s face. They was still expecting their first little daughter, and they just were walking towards a shop after leaving their car, to shop for the baby – I always wanted a child, but that way, that she is from the man I love, it’s even much better – she was rejoicing at this like a little girl. She was in this wonderful mood since she got to know that she was expecting a baby from Laurence.
- I have hadn’t got so lovely wife like you so this little girl surely going to be that lovely too! – the man cheerfully embraced her with one of his arms.
- I surely going to seem to be pretty old-fashioned but I want to buy pink clobbers for her but only because I love this color! – his wife was grinning when they arrived in the shop.
- OK, the essence is just they should be comfortable to the baby – Laurence began looking at the swaddling-clothes. They came out with a heap of clobbers after one hour later.
- It’s good that I have a so experienced husband like you! – Heni continued it, still in that mood.
- I’m also happy about you also like children so much like me – the man said more seriously after they got in the car, and he stroked his wife’s face’s and hair’s edge.
- But, by the way, I love that you’re such an experienced, successful man who people can look up to! – she embraced Laurence, with being an ardent supporter of him, and he kissed her – But I really did would like to have some children at least only to take care of them, even if they aren’t mine, because they’re so sweet, or I don’t know why – she reflected.
- I maybe see myself in them. I didn’t really have childhood, and I maybe would like to give them their due to live a complete life, or live at all. To they aren’t short of life like I was short of freedom, and of life what acting learning deputized for my life - they were just embracing each order and talking on the back seat while on the other side of the limo’s wall what was let down, the chauffeur was taking them home. The moment came three months later. Heni was sitting in front of the TV, and when the show came to an end, and she stood up from the sofa, her labor pains began. Laurence already went to sleep earlier, but he woke up by the scream and hurried downstairs from the bedroom, to the living –room.
- I think the childbirth began! It’s hurting me so much! – his wife began to speak, sounding lamenting. Laurence thought by this scream that something trouble happened to Heni.
- Calm down! Only think about how much we have wanted to see the baby!
- I know that I planned to think about it this time too! I knew that it is going to very hurt me but it’s so hard thinking about something else this time! – she said between two labor pains. She used to be terrified of this day with looking forward to their common child is born. The man took her to the hospital to they give Heni something strong painkiller, even if the time of childbirth hasn’t came, and to they got know why she had got so huge pains. His wife was crying and whining in the car, next to him.
- Is it surely that thing? Or is there something problem? – she asked.
- I think there isn’t anything, just the baby is coming, but they surely can help you if it’s hurting you so much, why would you be suffering at home…
- I’m bearing it very wrong, ant I? – she asked with guilty conscience in her voice – But I’m really looking forward to see our little daughter, not only because that suffering is going to come to an end then! – she gave excuses with sweet, convincing voice.
- You aren’t the reason of it’s hurting you so much. By the way, if the labor pains are so frequent like these, you’re surely going to be past it soon – Laurence was comforting her while he embraced and helped her to get out of the car. In the hospital it was found out that it was really the time of childbirth, but it also came out soon that the baby was lying in a wrong way in her so they had to do Caesarian section. Laurence was waiting in the corridor till the end while Heni was in one of the rooms, and they immediately began the Caesarian section, so he couldn’t meet her before it. They just informed the man about the situation and about they had to hurry, he is going to able to go into the room to his wife and daughter after they finished it. He already has lived his three children’s birth but it hasn’t necessary to do Caesarian section at any occasion.
- What risks does it involve? How much chance is there not going to be any problem? – he asked the doctor in the corridor.
- This present case isn’t such a dangerous situation. There is big probability not going to be any complication and everything is going to be successful – t he blondish-brown haired woman doctor, who was wearing a ponytail, was smiling encourage way, and tolerantly because of the man’s anxiety. Everything went really easily. The only reason was to do immediately the Caesarian section; there wasn’t almost any risk in the expectation of this. After they finished it, they showed the little girl to the parents. Heni suddenly didn’t know if she has had even huger experience in her life than when she saw that little, sweet, unprotected tiny tot for the first time who was a mixture of Laurence and her. Maybe she even wasn’t happier when they became a couple, or at their wedding, or when they got know that she was expectant. She happily took her tiny hand and was stroking her face.
- I don’t even feel I would be weak after the operation – she was smiling through her tears while was looking at Laurence. That was also special wonder for her that she has became a mother. It was an incredible experience.
- Maybe I’m feeling it for the first time that I’m also happy about we have a common child too, from us – the man was smiling – If I just look at her, I feel that she makes us to even more belong together – he was stroking the baby and gave a peck to his wife. After Heni and the little girl could leave the hospital, Laurence taught her wife everything about how to look after an infant, and Heni enjoyed every minutes she spent with them, and that there was that adorable, sweet baby who was hers, but the main thing was that she was happy about that she was Laurence’s and her child.
	When the four-year-old Heni stepped into the room, she didn’t even disturb her high spirits. Her dark brown hair was in two ponytails; her bright yellow dress stressed the nice color of her half-blooded skin. She loved look after her as much as after the even more younger ones, she acquainted her with the wonderful moments of educating children by a bit other aging group. The twenty-three-year-old mom enjoyed that she could clothe her little daughter that way how she liked it, however, but already the younger Heni also intervened in choosing clothes.
- Mom, you said we’re setting!
- Don’t shout, Loretta has fallen asleep! – she whispered and put the baby into the cradle what was designed with pale pink and white colors. She always spoke to the children in Hungarian, and Laurence in English, how they agreed with each other on this. By so doing they are going to speak both of these languages.
- So are you coming? – the little Heni said already in a lower voice but still didn’t whisper. Her parents have begun to detect on her the jealousy towards the babies, but, because of the many filming and preparing for them, they hadn’t have time to talk about this.
	They went to the living-room and getting their sandals on, the mother called the babysitter to come to take care of the little ones. Jenny lived in the adjoining house so she came whenever when they left the children at home alone. Comparatively unreliable magazines wrote something like that the eighteen-year-old babysitter had a relationship with the married actor because she lived so near him and often went to go to their house because of the children, but almost nobody believed it, and Heni was also sure of there wasn’t a word of truth in it. She trusted her husband hundred percent. If he cheated her, even if once, she maybe would stop him because she loved him that way how she had got to know him and faithfulness also belonged to this. But she sometimes missed him almost unbearably when he was on filming through months and came home only on some weekends. And he was also on filming now when they should talk over the little Heni’s jealousy towards the babies. She mentioned the subject to the little girl during they were going to shopping.
- How many times have I told you that the little ones are sleeping, but you just continued the rowdiness by your shouts and plays! – broke out of her, sounding desperate when they almost arrived at the next crosswalk. They were going on foot because there was a store not far away, and, by the way, Heni couldn’t drive.
- But you, and dad when he is at home, always take care of only them.
- You know that it isn’t true. We look after you too, just there isn’t so much time for it nowadays – Heni said nervously when they were going through the crosswalk.
- And why don’t you have time for me if you have time for them?
- They’re still very young so they need our care more.
- Why would they need it more?! – the little girl was already shouting.
- Well, OK, we’ll talk it over later, when you have already calmed down – the mother said also nervously, and they didn’t even talk to each other during the rest time till the store. Then, when they arrived at the store and Heni was choosing some clothes for Loretta and the little Laurence too, the little girl began to speak again.
- You said we’re buying some clothes for me!
- But I didn’t say that we aren’t going to buy anything for the little ones, and, because we’re already here, I’m buying for them too what are necessary – then the little girl threw the baby clobbers out of the shopping basket.
- Now I really won’t by you anything, just what we have already chosen! – the mother was nervously taking the bedspreads, rattles and baby clothes back into the shopping basket, and, with her other hand, she was strongly holding the little girl’s hand not to try to throw her younger brother’s and sister’s clobbers to the floor again. At the cash desk, she gave a lot more bill of one hundred dollars than she had to, it was lucky that the cashier didn’t abuse the situation, she said Heni didn’t have to give that much money, and gave the rest of it back – You see, it was also because of you! – Heni remarked after she left the store with the little girl – I almost left there more money than the cost of your clobbers!
- Why are you who is angry while you deal only with that cute babies and you got bored with me? – Heni took a breath and tried to calm down.
- They aren’t less cute than you and we didn’t get bored with you – she s said, sounding already much kindlier but it was like the little girl didn’t even hear it.
- And why do you rebuke me when I’m noisy and they sleep and why don’t you rebuke them when they cry loudly and I sleep?
- They still don’t understand anything we say them.
- And why do you look after only them?!
- I already said we also look after you.
- But much less than after them!
- Because they’re still so young that they can’t do almost anything without us.
- So why don’t you call Jenny oftener to look after them?!
- Because we are their mom and dad and they should be mainly with us.
- But I’m not mainly with you!
- But you’re with us a lot too, only less because you already learned that we are your parents but they still have to remember this – it took a bit long time, the little Heni was picking a fight with her during all the way, but, after a while, she succeed to convince her of the babies needed them more than she needed them, but soon, when they’re going to be older, they’re going to have more time for her too and they already loved her as much as them.
	When they already almost arrived in home, they saw that Laurence’s car was arriving. The little girl was apparently happy about this because they haven’t met for weeks, he came home only when Loretta and Laurence was born. Heni was much happier about this than their little daughter. But the situation was different then… She just talked with their common daughter that common business over, what already both of them planned, because she believed that her husband is going to arrive only some days later! But she nor could stand some days what the little Heni did against the babies.

- Hi! I believed you come only some days later… - the wife began to speak with a fake smile when they had also arrived and met in the living-room.
- It’s better that you haven’t become an actor too – the man answered surprise – There is something problem?
- Well… just…. – Heni was apparently considering about what to say and how to say something.
- So you don’t want to tell me.
- I don’t even know…
- You know that you can tell me anything.
- Yeah, I’m just afraid of you’ll be angry…
- What do you mean? – Laurence asked startled.
- I’ll tell you later. I didn’t count on you’ll come so soon like this so I didn’t have enough time to get ready to this conversation – Laurence left her wife alone in the middle of the living-room and went upstairs to his study. He was happy about he could come home earlier to his wife and children, at this point, Heni conducted herself with him as she would hide something from him. He hardly dares to word even to himself what this all thing could be. He called Tom Cruise on phone to meet in the deserted park where they did many times, with the other stars, to passer-byes who would identify them, don’t harass them, where he was with Heni on their first date, because of this too.
	They arrived after a half an hour and sat down to one of the benches.
- Would you tell me at last, why did you call me there? Because I feel like it isn’t going to be a simple chat.
- Heni conducted herself such a queer when I came home. She always used to be happy about I come home, and now she didn’t even answer what her problem is. I’ve thought about asking my closer friends to shadow her but I still owe them after they tried to buy every copy of Montana’s film.
- You think she cheats you almost at the same time when the children were born? – Tom was wondering.
- It’s also pretty luck that till now that I was that one who a girl needed who was twenty-nine y ears younger than me. Would you follow her when she lives the house alone?
- I? Why won’t you engage a private eye? Or why won’t you be you who’ll go? I don’t mean it would be a too big task, I’m just asking it.
- If I told it one more person and those who know what his job is, saw while he was going after Heni, it could leak out and I already have to get ready to the next filming. And since we live in Hollywood too, also you are near to us. But, of course, I’m going to repay you for this one day if you will do it. I’m not going to wait that long with it like with my close friends, it’s naturally that we help each order when there is a big trouble but I don’t even meet you too much nowadays and I met you to ask you for something.
- They have called you to another movie already again? At the end, you’re going to be a bigger star than me! – Tom was laughing appreciatively.
- So will you do it?
- In the end, there isn’t much of the rest of my script what I have to memorize to my newest movie and the filming is going to start only next month.
	Heni tried to call Laurence to ask him where he went without any word after he left the study but his phone was turned off. She went back into the children’s room, and the children made her forget all of her problems. She happily dressed Loretta and the little Laurence into their new clothes while she was highly delighted with them, then she still was holding them in her arms long and was hugging and stroking them. Later she gently put them to the twin-carriage and went with them and with the little Heni to the playground.
- What was in n the nursery school yesterday? – Heni began to speak cheerfully when they set. It was Saturday and she didn’t even ask it yesterday.
- I was playing with Allie when Chris wanted to seize my doll and Ms. Trustworthy rebuked me because I shouted while I was who was right!
- That can quite easily happen. The nursery school teacher surely couldn’t see what that boy had done. Don’t even be nervous because of something like this – Heni stroked the little girl’s head.
- I don’t even care for it – the little Heni was smiling.
- So that’s OK. And you nor should be angry with that Chris. He surely likes you and wanted to awake your attention – Heni was smiling when said it, while they were going on the long stony way what leaded to the playground.
- But he ripped my doll’s hair out!
- It isn’t a trouble, I’ll buy another one for you homewards - they’ve arrived. Heni sat down to one of the empty benches – Anyway, you deserve it because you already understand that I love you as much as your younger brother and sister – she said and embraced the little girl – Well, go to play, then I’ll buy a nice doll for you! – the little Heni cheerfully ran away, and was already showing the tricks on the climbing frames to her mom. It wasn’t necessary already to rebuke her because one of these would be too dangerous to her, she already could conducting herself well. Loretta and the little Laurence were quietly sleeping in the baby carriage during it, and when Heni was taking the children backward, they went into a toy shop, and Heni bought the promised doll for the little girl, what the little Heni chosed.

	After they had came back, she bathed the little ones, and when put them back to their place, a teenager girl’s bitter shouting can was heard from outside, into the house. She looked out by curiosity what could happen, and she saw an about sixteen-year-old, half-long, red haired, thin, pretty girl whom the guards were leading off in front of the gate by force. Heni was almost shocked by the sight so she plucked up all of her courage and asked the guards to let her go. They considered a bit, and then obeyed; anyway, the star’s wife is a name at the house too.
- Thought you… - the girl surprised dried her tears.
- Why were you lingering at the gate? – Heni inquired.
- I’m just… a very big fan of Laurence and wanted to meet him personally.
- He’s not at home now but I think he is going to come home soon. Aren’t you coming in till then? – the guards and the teen girl were completely surprised.
- I can go in? – the girl was surprised laughing.
- Of course, come! – Heni opened the gate and they went into the house together.
- Wow, what a nice garden! And also this house! It can be super to live here! – the teenage girl was looking at the perfectly mowed grass, the huge pool, the flowers what were arranged to various formations and the big, golden house, what had snow white windows, balconies and doors.
- I was also wondering so much like you when I moved into the house. His previous house was already perfect, too.
- Well, I thought that a movie star surely live in a house like this but it impossible to get ready for this sight – the girl was marveling too by seen the living-room what was furnished with modern furniture, and they sat down to the dark sofa.
- You haven’t even told me your name.
- I’m Lucy. And you’re Henrietta. I know everything about Laurence, it’s naturally that I know the name of his wife – she was laughing.
- And how old are you?
- I’m seventeen. And you’re twenty-three.
- Since when have you been Laurence’s fan? – Heni was smiling.
- Already since I was twelve years old, like you.
- And what do you like in him? You like his roles in the movies?
- Well… Yeah.
- So why did you broke down so much when they led you off in front of the gate by force? – Heni asked with pity in her voice.
- Well…
- You don’t have to make excuses for it, to me; I’ve already suspected what you feel towards him before I let you in. You think if I was angry with you because of this, I let you in?
- He is the most attractive man whom I’ve seen in my life.
- I also went through this, however they didn’t lead me off in front of the gate because I didn’t linger there but I felt pity on you when I noticed you. I know how it feels to be in a very-very unrequited love. We aren’t guilty by this, we can’t direct our emotions. So… - Heni took the girl’s hand – it would be a huge thing to me too in the past if we would even if I was one of Laurence’s friends because there was more hope than till then. Would you like me to talk to Laurence to meet you sometimes? I don’t want anything more between you and him, but you can be one of his friends not to feel that this situation is so hopeless. However, I hope we’ll stay together forever and won’t cheat any of us the other one, but, because you would know that if we’ll get divorced, you’re going to be close enough to be more than friendship between you, so it wouldn’t hurt you so much, at least I felt like this when still Gina was his wife. So if it’s real love what you feel towards him, I can help you to be easier to live with this – Lucy was just wondering at Heni’s words.
- Well… Yes. I think I love him – she said, sounding seriously – So will you get him to meet me? – she became immediately cheerful. Laurence arrived in home just in this moment. Lucy immediately jumped up from the sofa, screamed a huge and was jumping for joy because she already can see him in live.
- One of your friends came to you? – the man began to speak in a bored manner. He has count on if one of Heni’s friend comes to her from Hungary, she’ll react that way if she notices him. He already got used to the teen girls’ and bigger fans’ reactions like this.
- No, it’s Lucy, your very big fan.
- And how has she get here? – he was wondering.
- I felt a pity on that poor one when the guards wanted to take her from the gate by force that I let her in – the man greeted the girl, gave her an autograph and politely said her to go home. Then he turned towards his wife.
- You’re already going to let all sorts of teen girls into the house who is lingering at the gate?
- No, I just felt so much pity on her. You should see how much desperate she was by the guards began leading her off.
- It’s interesting – Laurence said with frowned up eyebrows and downcast eyes, and disappeared in his study again.
- Hello, it’s me again. You will not believe what happened!
- Hi. Tell me! Is it about the same business?
- Well, it really seems to be like yes…
- You found her there with her lover?
- No. But she’s taking measures as she would like to get divorce in peace. Like she already would have been searching for somebody else for me…
- She hasn’t spoken about divorce yet. An addition, nor about cheating. But this thing proves that she is going to speak about this soon.
- Exactly.
- Why, what did she do?
- She called a little teenager fan into the house to meet me. Who does something like this???
- I nor have heard about something like this – Tom was laughing – And what did you do with her?
- I gave her an autograph and said her to go away. I don’t care about she’s every younger than Heni, I don’t need anyone else. I am fed up with the teen girls’ hustling. I love only Heni.
- Well, I nor could cheat my partner, even if people think whatever about every stars, only because they can do anything – Tom laughed again – But it’s pretty good feeling that young girls still like us when we’re already in this age, isn’t it?

	In the rest of the day, Laurence was keeping an eye in secret on Heni’s behavior while they were looking after the children, then, when they went out to the living-room and he was memorizing his script while sitting on the sofa, sometimes looked at them during it. The most important reason of Heni’s love towards the children was always that fact they were their common children, and the man wanted to know if her relationship changed with them, but he didn’t notice anything. He thought he just didn’t want to notice it because he didn’t want to accept that he lost Heni, at least that he is going to lose her soon. Or she behaved with the children the same way only because they were her own children too? Or by sense of responsibility? He hardly could pay attention to memorizing the script.
	In the evening, Heni put the children to bed, and she met Laurence again in the living-room.
- I would like to talk something over with you – the wife began it, Laurence didn’t surprise, he has been already waiting for talking about the divorce because of the other man.
- It is the high time to speak about this… - he answered bluntly.
- I know that it seemed to be pretty stupid that I let one of your fans into the house but she’s really a big fan of you and it would be very important for her to meet you more – the man surprised. So she was still continuing to search someone for him, and she is going to speak about the divorce after this.
- And why would I meet her? – he asked surprised, with frowned eyebrows and downcast his eyes.
- Come on, let’s sit down, let’s talk it over! – Heni was almost praying for it. They sat down to the sofa.
- I’m really curious why do you want me so much to meet that little girl.
- That little girl really very adores you… I mean I see myself in her and she admitted to me that she loves you.
- So what should I do to her? – Laurence answered with feigned laughter.
- I know what she suffers by this much unrequited love because I’ve also gone through this. It’s a very grievous and desperate feeling. 
- So I should leave you for her??? – the man didn’t understand what Heni meant in this odd thing.
- Only meet her, at least once, and you may become friends. It’s very important for her to feel like there is more hope when you’re already friends, because if we’ll get divorced, what almost surely won' t happen, then she would be probable winner at you. I also thought the same about it when Gina was in my place.
- And if it turns out, my every fan is going to try it to say that they love me, to they’re going to meet me.
- We should say Lucy that if she tells it one of your fans, I mean if anyone else will also try it; you aren’t going to meet her anymore. I mean if suspiciously many people will try it because who knows how many people love you because you’re so adorable! Please, at least for my sake! – Heni was smiling and sat into Laurence’s lap.
- On my God, and I thought that you want to put me in touch with someone  in order to I also get somebody because you cheat me and want to get divorced!
-  What???
- It began with that you didn’t tell me why you were conducting yourself so strange when I came home from filming…
- Well, when I’m recalling it, it really could be suspicious! – Heni was laughing.
- So are you already going to tell me now what was it?
- If you agree to you’ll meet Lucy.
- OK.
- I haven’t wanted to tell you till now because you also planned to talk to Heni because she was jealous of her younger brother and sister. Well, I talked it over with her already that day and she isn’t jealous anymore. Many times I already couldn’t use to endure it anymore and to expose the little ones to this jealousy and I believed you are going to come home only later.
- The filming went so fast that we finished earlier than we tank, and I intended it surprise for you, this is why I didn’t tell you that I’m going to come home earlier. But you was who surprised me by I don’t have to struggle with talk her out of the jealousy.
- I believed that you’re going to be angry because you were preparing for this  unnecessarily – Heni was laughing 
- I’m sorry about I thought that you cheated me. It was so unbelievable that I have been who a girl needed who is so many years younger than me, even if only through some years.
- You’re better to get to it, you already know about Lucy, and who knows how many girls there are like us!
- I don’t care about the little teen girls; I had enough of you when you were in that age! On our holiday in Hawaii, you were who believed that I cheated you! – the man was laughing.
- But that seemed to be so unambiguous! – Heni was laughing.
- But this one was also really suspicious too! – they were laughing also at this.
- That’s right.
- And now you’re the sweetest girl in the world who is in her twenties. I didn’t even know that you’re so kind-hearted like this.
- But not because you’re getting a teen girl from me! – Heni was laughing.
- I don’t even want every teen girls in the world, only that beauty in her twenties – Laurence was smiling and kissed his wife. They were kissing long, and then they went upstairs, into the bedroom.
	In the morning, Laurence called Tom on phone.
- Thought you for what you would do for me but fortunately it came out that I still don’t need your help.
- Well, what happened?
- I only was imagining things about she doesn’t love me anymore. I was never in a situation before like this that I’m with a girl who is so much younger than me, as an addition, she married me, and, at the first occasion, I began doubt she still wants me. I was never so jealous before like this, I always trusted in myself, maybe because of my fame, but it was so incredible that a girl who is twenty-nine years younger than me, loves me so much like this, that I also was surprised at my behavior that I immediately asked you for help. I have had some young fans before too who liked me as a man but this young girl really loves me and it’s an incredible experience to me also when we have been married for five years, and I also love her, so I got frightened that this big age-gap could divorce us, because she maybe didn’t find me as attractive as before.
- And how did you realize that still you are whom she loves?
- The reason of her mysticism was that she didn’t want me to be disappointed because unnecessarily was getting ready for reconciling the little Heni with Loretta and Laurence because she had already done  it! – he was just laughing at this – And the reason of that she let the teenager little girl in, was just she took a pity on her because she was in her place before too, so she wanted to make us become friends to so that the girl feels better! Imagine what a kind-hearted wife I have! – he eulogized, being head over heels in love. This nor used to be just like him that much before he and Heni hit upon each order.
	Heni took the little Heni to the little girl’s friend, then ran back to the little ones, fed them and put them to sleep, then went back for the older girl, took her home, they went into a shop on the way, and when they arrived in home, it came into her head that she didn’t now how to reach with Lucy, to tell her that the man agreed to the meeting. Maybe she’ll come back to the gate, because they haven’t given any availability to each order, so that to she let her to know in another way how Laurence decided. The little one’s crying was heard from the childrens’ room, she went back to calm them, then said the guards that when if they’ll see Lucy again at the gate, they can let her in, don’t lead her away.

	Next day Laurence took the little Heni to the nursery school, his wife was staying home with the even more little ones during it. When he arrived in home, Lucy was already waiting for him in the living-room. He already couldn’t have even a bit of calm, he had to immediately deal with this little girl? But he promised Heni to try to make friends with her at least for her sake. By using his actor’s talent, kindly greeted the teenager girl who was exultantly thoughted him that agreed to the meeting. Laurence wanted to be over this trial to make friends and the girl had time for this so they began speaking. She was wearing a pink top and a black mini skirt. Her clothing was reminding him of Montana. She weared these colors.
- This house is pretty nice. Since when have you been living here? – Lucy asked while sitting on the dark blue sofa.
- Not too long time ago – the man didn’t want to reveal too much to this stranger about his personal life, as an addition, he felt no desire to meet her – We moved here because it is nearer to the filming studios and to the events in Hollywood where I go but I still maintain that house where we lived in New York.
- Yeah, it’s reasonable… - the girl was bored with this subject, she only started with this not to seem  to be obstrusive.
- Where do you live? – Laurence asked by politeness.
- I nor moved here a long time ago – if she had lived there long since, she would have found the man earlier – I lived in Canada till now and I was also born there but my mom is American and she grew up mainly here, later she moved back to the U. S. with me and dad. Now we live in Los Angeles – the girl was mainly inquiring after the man, by curiosity, and Laurence was mainly inquiring after Lucy, by politeness. This talking about themselves, was completely indifferent for the man but he thought it maybe wasn’t so much intolerably boring so that he doesen’t meet her anymore, so they talked it over to meet some more. Laurence decided that way only for Heni’s sake, but, by politeness, he didn’t tell it the girl. They talked it over to talk next time next weekend, in the desolate park. Lucy was disappointed because they are going to meet after so a long time but she said she was happy about he was ready to meet her again at all. And it was worth for Laurence to meet her, because he saw that his wife was happy about they could help that girl. But what Heni said that afternoon, he thought that is going too far.
- I invented to make a foundation for those teenager girls who are unrequitedly love a star and want to stop it because they would have much more possibility to ever find someone who they could feel like this towards him, who would love them too. And mainly because I know how terrible it is to live with this desperate feeling, when we almost surely know that there will not to be anything between us and whom we love the most in the world, at most we can ask him for an autograph.
- And why do they need any money? – there was a lot of incomprehension in the man’s voice.
- They need it to go to those huge psychiatrists who would help them to leave this thing, and huge psychiatrists cost much money. And we also should care about the poor ones who don’t have enough money to go even just to an average psychiatrist or psychologist, and I know it sounds to be stupidity but I also considered about we would help them meeting their beloved star personally, at least once, when their filming is too far from them so these teens haven’t got enough money to go there. This meeting would cheer them up so much that it would help their state of mind a lot.
- If you think it’s such a good idea, what do you think, why didn't it come to anybody’s mind till now? – Laurence asked with incredulity.
- Because I suffered this, I know what they feel, and also I have possibility to help them.
- You think your special plight is a good example for them continuing to daydream about their stupidities? – the man asked, sounding rough.
- It was completely clear for me too how much hopeless my situation was before it worked out exceptionally for me, what they only daydream about, we shouldn’t convince them of how bad that situation is, it’s already enough grievous for them, and when they also remind them, there isn’t worse thing than this. I’m rather a positive example from the point of view of their situation isn’t completely hopeless. It counts a lot to know that there is a little bit of hope, or they could be even completely depressed.
- And you think there are so many people in this situation that it’s worth concluding a foundation for them? – the conversation stopped because Loretta began crying, so Heni went to her into the children’s room, and Laurence went upstairs, into the study, dot memorize the script.

- Have I said how much I’m proud of my kind-hearted wife? – Laurence was smiling while was praising Heni, with apologizer voice, after they went to sleep, and he was stroking his wife’s hair and face – This foundation isn’t necessary, you already helped a lot because you landed even if this only girl into a better situation.
- Maybe you’re right, there couldn’t be that many people who really love their favorite star – Heni was stroking the man’s chest – Just I really love you so much that I see my situation in their ones when I hear about even if a bit similar one. It doesn’t mean that I’m kind-hearted; just it shows too how much I love you – she kissed her husband, they were stroking each order’s body and completely forgot the other girls.

Next day Heni reflected on the foundation again. It came into her head that she has read about really there are girls who really suffer from a requited love they feel towards a star. As an addition, what she read then, when she was a teenager, was addressed exactly to them, who don’t now hot to come out of this love. If there is a reading like this, what’s addressed to them, it’s necessary. Beside it, this book can’t reach everybody, as an addition, it didn’t help her personally anything. But she didn’t want to bother Laurence with this subject anymore. They maybe would be discussing again, and, anyway, he was busy studying the script and going to rehearsals. But it still didn’t mean his wife didn’t deal with this business.
There really occurred another problem to Laurence, hot that thing to talk to with his wife about the foundation she was planning, and not just to study the script and to rehearsals. When he came home from that day’s rehearsal, he slammed the door from after himself that way that I was even audible from the other side of the house, not just the not too far-away children’s room. Loretta and the little Laurence even began crying by this.
- Would you tell me what happened?! Because if it isn’t something tragedy, please don’t make the children to be scared to death! – Heni was coming to the living-room, with the younger Laurence in her arms.
- You’re right, don’t all of my children deserve that treatment like that little bitch will get from me!
- Montana… began it again? – Heni was shocked.
- When she stopped it, I was so happy about it that I was even ready to speak to her again! It seems like she need already a bigger punishment to don’t continue to ashamed her family!
- What do you want to do?
- I not have an idea. What do you think, what should I do to this child?
- She’s not a child anymore. She’s only one year younger than me. And everybody knows that you are against what she does, it already came out when her first film came out. Or does she use your family name again?
- No. But the only way of she can be much more fashionable that the other porn stars if she announces whose daughter she is, and they are going to continue to announce it in news and on TV too because it’s easier to sell the piece of news. And she begin it for the first time so long time ago that they maybe even forgot till now that I’m her father because she used my name only in the beginning of this.
- They are going to nag you again with their questions about what do you say to she began it again! – Heni ticked off too.
- But what do they think, what do I say to this?! I’m happy about my daughter shows herself nude during having sex all kinds of swine?!
- We have to get her somehow to don’t do this.
- But how?!
- I don’t know, invite something, you’re much smarter than me!
- I think we should consider about this tomorrow, we rehearsed a lot today, it’s already midnight and I’m dead tired.
- OK.
	After they had a shower and went to sleep, they didn’t fall asleep soon, nor in spite of tiredness, because Montana’s depravity still was on their mind.
- She already didn’t violated only my, your and Heni’s life but there are the two little ones too. You are even less who it serves right this fuss what they’re going to make because of this hideous act, and you are nor who it serves right to listen to our ticked off because of this – Laurence was stroking Heni’s hair and face then too – And don’t keep saying that I’m smarter than you, you rather should be proud of how much you conflict with Montana – then they began smiling – I also even hardly used to bear that I could hardly touch you before marriage, I, who disowned his daughter because she does it in public. But maybe I still spoiled something in her educating because she has sunk so low like this.
- You also know that you don’t have much time, because of the filming, script memorizing and rehearsals, and after you got divorced from Hajna, you used to meet her even more rarely because she still lived at her mother when she was a little child.
- Maybe Hajna allowed her to get into bad company, to depraved children can affect her badly…
- Or she used to hide who she used to make friends.
- But she would have to realize that she began to be depraved. And I also could realize it.
- Well, it seems like she used to hide it well, what things she had in her mind.
- And what things could she used to do with her friends already when she was a child…
- Maybe she got into bad company only in her teenager years.
- Maybe.

	In the morning they woke up by the little Laurence was crying. They couldn’t guess what he was wanting. It wasn’t necessary to change the baby, nor was he hungry. They noticed only after these that Loretta wasn’t there in the cradle next to him. But where was Loretta? They frightened looked at if one of them left her on the sofa or one of the armchairs by chance but she nor was there.
- Did you lock the door when you came home? – Heni asked with trembling voice.
- Who would think about this in that mood?
- Oh my God! – Heni clutched her lips and tears were flowing on her face.
- But why would they kidnap her? – the answer already arrived in the next minute. Laurence’s phone rang so he answered. A deformed voice immediately began to speak. The man set the phone to loud.
- I know what you should do, I mean what you shouldn’t do to get your little daughter back.
- Who are you?
- I am who loves Montana just the way she is.
- You’re her boyfriend? – the man was even more shocked.
- Quite! And I’m telling you already in advance that your daughter tried to talk me out of the action so she isn’t for it at all.
- How can we get Loretta back?
- It’s simple. You just have to endure Montana’s career without you would put a crimp in her style. If you will take the piss out of her after you got her back, you can count on I’m going to take one of your children. If you’ll speak to the police, I’m not going to treat her well.
- What the hell do you know about how to treat a baby?!
- Calm, I have got some friends who keep a baby, I’ve took care of them when they’ve went to somewhere!
- And why should I believe it?
- It’s total the same what you believe it?
- It’s total the same what you believe if you won’t pick a fight Montana through a day you’re going to get the kid back.
- If something trouble will happen to her, I’ll call the police.
- Who knows, I may succeed kidnap her again, and already a bigger trouble will happen to her then. But calm, isn’t going to happen to her any trouble if you won’t nag your daughter through a day.
- And how will we get Loretta back?
- I don’t know, Montana will take her back in the afternoon.
- You want me to conduct myself with her like didn’t happen anything?
- Yeah, you can begin practice already then how to normally tread her. Or you rather nor need your other daughter? – Laurence was considering through some seconds and gathered all his strength to can use his actor’s talent in this situation too like this. Maybe it also even would cause even more trouble if the boy will hear by his voice how much furious he was.
- I do…
- So I’m going to send Montana with the baby tomorrow but if I’ll hear from her that you treated her badly, even if on telephone, you’re going to lose your other daughter too – they finished the conversation.
- I don’t believe it! He forces that dirty bitch on me not to hurt an innocent baby! I have to feign everything is OK between us, and the all world is going to judge me to be who accepts his daughter’s disgusting occupation!
- But you’ll agree to his game, wont you? It’s the only way to get back Loretta! – Heni said with trembling voice, ashen and being scared to death.
- I’m surely going to bear it somehow till tomorrow, and then I’ll let the police loose on this bastard. I’m going to engage some bodyguards to he doesn’t try it one more time till they will arrest him.
- They may never catch him. He surely hides that he is Montana’s boyfriend and this is everything we know about him. And if it came out till then that they’re a couple, they surely announced they’ve split up and only we say that it isn’t right and they aren’t going to show together on and they aren’t going to show together on public places.
- They’re going to track it down who he can be of the boys who go into her house. Anyway, the bodyguards can be necessary since I became more famous and we can plentifully allow it us.
- But this boy was quite capable of kidnap a baby! He may come here next time with a weapon and he can be so skilled in crime theat the bodyguards even wont be anough difficulty to him!
- We will engage that much that they are surely going to be enough.
- What do you think, does he normally treat Loretta? Say any trouble wont happen to her! – Heni and Laurence embraced each other.

	Next day Heni was nervously trying whist the little Laurence, who was still constantly crying. Her husband was on rehearsal since morning, they’ve talk to each order once till then, on phone, and he also admitted that the rehearsal wasn’t going very well to him because he was constantly worrying about Loretta.
	After a while, Heni gave it up, whistling the little boy, put him back into his light blue crib. She went to the bedroom where she kept her phone and called Jenny to come to take care of him while she is going to the little Heni to her friend, anyway, maybe the babysitter, whist the little boy easier because she didn’t succeeded it such a nervously like this.
	Then she went back downstairs, to the living-room, where the little Heni was watching TV.
Would you care for go to Allie? – she asked with forced gaiety. She didn’t want the little girl to be at home when Montana is going to bring Loretta who will be in a who knows what like shape if her criminal boyfriend still hurt her. Heni was also worrying about this all day and about if the boy will keep his promise and give the little girl back. She nor wanted the little Heni to keep on seeing her in that mood. She was trembling by fear all day because of the question about what will happen to Loretta.
- I’ve been at her not long ago and we meet in the nursery school too – the little girl said in a bored manner.
- I’m waiting for a guest now and you wouldn’t feel good while she is going to be here – in the end that was true. That some seconds while she is going to speak to that porn star if she will speak to her at all, it’s not going to be a pleasant sight for this little girl. Besides, she would begin to inquire after why did was she angry with her. What could she tell to this four-years-old child?
- It’s the same to me. Just I’m watching the cartoon till the end – the little Heni agreed to this. Heni felt relief and went back into the children’s room, maybe she is going to succeed whist his little brother who was still crying, and she calmed down a bit so it was a better time to try it. She took the little Laurence into her arms again, she embraced ter time to try it.  could she tell to this four-years-old child?him and was cradling him, and the little boy calmed down a little bit too, then Jenny already arrived.
	After she answered the door, she was frightened when it came into her head that she still hasn’t call Allie’s parents to ask them if she could take the little Heni there. She nervously hurried upstairs, into the bedroom, and called them. Fortunately the time was suitable for them.
	Heni left with the little girl, caught a taxi, accompanied the little Heni into Allie’s house, exchanged a few words with her parents, and went home also by taxi. Jenny succeed make the little Laurence calm down by the time.
	Heni calmed down a bit, set down in front of the TV, and somebody rang after some minutes. She excitedly stood up from the sofa, maybe Montana brought Loretta. She turned the TV off and answered the door. When Heni noticed the girl at the door, in the black top with deep neckline and extra little short what remembered her of her job, holding the little girl in her arms, she was overcome by anger. Fortunately, Laurence was just at rehearsal so he didn’t have to feign he completely accepted his older daughter’s shameless grandstanding. It also even disturbed him that that porn star touched that innocent baby. The sigh completely broke Heni down too. Fortunately, she didn’t have to feign to be the friendly relative. Anyway, she wasn’t such a close relative that they would meet often, even if she wouldn’t have that immoral career like this.
Hello! I’m sorry about my boyfriend had so much agro, I really didn’t want it – Montana began to speak.
- Yeah? So why didn’t you take Loretta back earlier?! – Heni answered and slammed the door. This bitch was the reason of everything! She almost considered her as an enemy till now too because she brought a shame to Laurence, she didn’t even understand how could be somebody so shameless like this girl, mainly because she did it only because she felt like would like to be famous a little bit. She, Heni wasn’t even able to do it if it was really very necessary. She wasn’t able to do any similar thing either. It wasn’t wonder that she was a criminal boy’s girlfriend like this. Heni embraced the little infant, she didn’t let her go through long time, and then put her into her cradle what was empty through more than a whole day.

- So what was it like? Did he treat you normally? – the girl’s boyfriend began to speak immediately when Montana arrived at home.
- Daddy wasn’t even at home. I met only Heni.
- What?! He wasn’t at home?! So he avoids you. Now we have to take this kid back!
- Listen, I think it isn’t necessary, rather find it out before this why wasn’t he at home! He surely wouldn’t avoid me after you threatened him with this.
- And how to find it out?! – the boy asked nervously.
- Call Heni and ask her where is he. Then you can call somebody who is with him if are they really there.
- And how to get its phone number?!
- It’s surely easier than kidnap a baby. I still haven’t even thoughted you for this. Thoughts for I have such a boyfriend who takes care of me! – Montana embraced the boy while she was smiling.
- OK, I’ll call him – he went into the room where he has leaved his phone and he called Laurence. They were exactly having a break so he turned his phone on. The boy didn’t deform his voice then.
- Hello, I’m one of Heni’s friends; would you give me her number?
- If you are a friend of her, why don’t you have her number?
- We’re not that close friends…
- And how do you have my number?
- One of my pals knows you, I met Heni by him. I’ve met you once too.
- Really? What’s your name?
- I’m David. Don’t you remember?
- No. What do you want from Heni?
- Only her number.
- But why do you need her phone number?
- Why would I need it??? Because I would like to talk to her!
- It seems to me like you’re hiding something from me.
David reflected.
- Where are you now?
- It has nothing in common with Heni’s phone number.
- Now it seems to me like you’re hiding something from me – David answered with feigned laughter.
- I’m at a rehearsal if you want to know this.
- Who are there?
- Why?
- I just would like to talk to somebody because I don’t have too many friends and maybe there are somebody between you who I know – this guy surely isn’t in his right mind, Laurence thought and got tired of the conversation so gave the phone to the director to shake him off. He confirmed to David’s question that it really was a filming rehearsal.
- Didn’t I tell you? – Montana said after David reported the conversation – But you pretty smartly solved the situation! However, when you asked where is he now and when you answered that you just wanted to talk to somebody because you hardly had some friends, these were pretty odd! – the girl was laughing.
- Yeah, it was really hard to invent something. But you still haven’t told me how Heni treated you.
- I was pretty nice, I was giving excuses for the kidnapping but that girl just slammed the door that way that I felt like that door is going to knock against me!
- I don’t believe it!
- What’s up?
- Why didn’t you tell me till now? – Now I unnecessarily took the piss out of myself with this telephone conversation! And we have to kidnap that baby again!
- But your condition didn’t concern that woman!
- And she can treat you what way she wants?! You want to end up in the rehab because you allow them to knock you out?!

	Laurence arrived in home front the rehearsal late in the evening again.
- H! Did you become very tired?
- Hi – Heni and the man kissed and embraced each order. They haven’t met all day because Laurence was rehearsing with the actors and they could talk only once by phone too, because that madman was nagging him at the other break what took a half an hour.
- Where is Loretta? – the man asked immediately and set towards the children’s room.
- Montana took her home how that boy promised it.
- I rather don’t even ask what was it like…
Well, you shouldn’t even ask it. But I was considering while you wasn’t at home, and I’ve got an idea. What if I talked her into leave that job?
- You’re right; anybody didn’t prohibit you from doing it.
- Quite!
- But she should pay a high price for what she does!
- I agree! – Loretta was still in Laurence’s arms when they heard something noise. It was louder and louder and was approaching towards them, then softly opened the children’s room’s door.
	He was a surprised boy in his twenties. He didn’t count on they were still in the children’s room at such a time. The children already sleep when it’s getting late like this. But his conjecture was true that Laurence nor locked the door then because he was only thinking of if Loretta was really at home, at them and of he wanted to see her again and also he was tired because of the all-day rehearsal, and he also pretty made him tired by that phone conversation. 
The parents were shocked while standing with the children in their arms. Heni already took the little Laurence out of the crib to guard him. David got in on the act and begun to speak:
- I heard how the mommy treated my girlfriend. If you’re giving me one of the kids, I won’t use this – he took a pistol out and pointed it at Heni. Laurence stood before his wife and answered:
- You didn’t say anything about she also has to feign to be the nice hostess.
- That’s right. But you believed I will allow anybody to nag Montana and hinder her career? Or that it isn’t the same to me who will I shoot?
- You would shoot your girlfriend’s father?! – Heni stood before Laurence.
- Who disowned her what landed her in rehab? Yes! So will you give me one of the kids or you want me to choose somebody of you?
- If we’ll give her or him to him, we’re never going to get her or him back – Laurence said.
- Yes, you said this! – Heni began to speak while she was sobbing and trembling so much that almost dropped the child.
- You know what you want – David said and shot, Laurence pushed Heni aside, hanged on to the crib and put Loretta into it. David put the pistol away and ran away. Heni shouted her husband’s name. He was still clinging to the crib but he was already kneeling on the floor and panting by the pain while the blood was oozing from his chest. His wife took his T-shirt off him and pressed it to the wound.
- Press it to this while I’m calling the ambulance! – she shouted while she ran away for her phone.

	Montana was already planning to give David a piece of her mind because he kidnapped this baby again who was her father’s. She talked to him with calm voice till now to talk him out of at least this second kidnapping but in vain. She was nervously walking up and down in her flat what was furnished with pink and black furniture, when her phone rang. It was David.
- There was a little problem. We should meet – the boy said in short.
- Of course, to involve me too in your criminal-businesses! Police is surely searching you now and they’re going to find us together! – the girl began it.
- That’s not the point. However, maybe they’re already searching me but…
- How dare you kidnap your girlfriend’s father’s child without her permission at all?! – she was raging.
- Let’s stop talking about this now; we will talk it over later. Something happened what we should talk over personally… - David tried remaining calm but his voice was trembling.
- What chance has it hat they’re already searching you? – Montana asked coldly.
- I not have an idea. But it is going to be a long conversation and I don’t have enough money spend too much to this calling.
- So already money is the only thing what matters for you! You were even ready to kidnap a child for me till now, and when you are in a danger, you don’t even care about me! As far as you’re concerned they can catch us together! – the girl ticked off.
- OK, so I’ll tell you. It worked till that your father didn’t lock the door and also, I wrapped the bodyguards up too but all of them were in that damned children’s room, in the expectation of that older little girl… I claimed one of the younger ones but they didn’t give it to me so…
- Why would they give it to you?!
- I took my pistol out and pointed it at them… But they didn’t give it so I had to shoot.
- You’re not in your right mind! Why was it necessary?!
- If I didn’t do it, they didn’t trust me, they weren’t afraid of me because I was quite capable of doing everything, to your father get off you with his hysteria! – David was already shouting too.
- Congratulations, he’s surely going to love me now because I have a guy like this!
- He is going to leave you alone at least; he’s not going to bother you by try to talk you out of your job!
- And you had to shoot to reach this?! Who did you shoot at all?! – Montana asked with fear and anger in her voice.
- Your father… - the boy said as softly as it was possible.
- Who?!!! – the girl heard it but couldn’t believe her ears.
- I pointed the pistol at the girl but that stupid stood before her! – David gave excuses for this.
- How do you speak about my father?! - You also really should get off him! You know he fed up with you, why don’t you live your life wit out him and why do you guard him?! – the boy shouted.
- But you have been quite capable of shooting him! My guy is a criminal who, as an addition, kidnaps and hurts the family of his girlfriend’s father!
- You want to break with me?!!! – David asked, sounded furious.
- You have only one chance. If you’ll do something, I may forgive you for these, but only because you did these hidousnesses for me! And only maybe!
- What is this? – the boy asked with fear in his voice. He was afraid about he had to give himself up.
- You will immediately find out into witch hospital they brought dad and that how is he! Then you will immediately call me and tell it me! You understand?!
- And what to say, who I am and how I know about the events???
- It’s total the same! Invent it!
- But how to find out where he is?! – the boy got frightened again.
- I help you! Try to find what hospitals are not far away and search their phone number! I don’t believe you even can’t settle it!
- You no have an idea about what I’m feeling! I was quite capable kidnapping and gunfight for you, and then you’re talking to me that way like you never did it before!
- Just don’t tell me I should praise you for what a criminal you are! Also, I tried to talk you out of this! Didn’t you do these rather against me by chance?!
- I'm not listening it anymore. I’m calling the hospitals, and then I’ll call you back.
	Heni was still sitting in the hospital’s corridor like a frightened little girl. Jenny was looking after the children. Fortunately, the older, four-year-old little girl slept at Allie tonight. Maybe she was already at home too because it was already at half past ten in the morning. But the effect of the barbiturate still hasn’t over. The doctor is going to tell her that she can go to him when it will be over. But it surely going to call the press before this – she thought. Also, she was wondering about they still haven’t arrive. Then she noticed Montana. How dare she come here???
- Hi! I said to the doctors to don’t allow the press to come here.
- And I’ll say the doctors don’t let you to your own father!
- Now what’s your problem???
- This all thing is your fault! Why did you come here at all? Maybe you can kill him what your guy didn’t succeed?
- He didn’t want to kill him either and both of us were happy about he survived it!
- And you didn’t even break with him because he shot your father!
- I was considering all night about if I should break with him! I haven’t even could decide because that was on my mind during it that I wanted dad to survive the operation too!
- Well, I still haven’t realized till now that you would take his interests into consideration!
- Don’t shout, it’s a hospital! By the way, you already can go in… - a doctor appeared.
- But don’t let in this bitch! – Heni softly interrupted the doctor but she was having lighting look. In spite of this, both of them set but the doctor stopped Montana to Heni go in first, she will ask the patient if he would like meet his daughter too.

	Heni’s tears were flowing again on her face when noticed the man with the soaked bandage by blood, lying on the bed.
- Why didn’t you let him to shoot me? I was who brought down that criminal’s wrath on myself! – she began to speak when set down to the chair next to him.
- You also know that they didn’t even say anything about you also had to take part in this comedy. Anyway, I wouldn’t let anybody to hurt you. Mainly because you really aren’t a reason of anything – the man answered during dried Heni’s tears with his hand and was stroking her face and hair – Calm down, I’m going to stay alive, the doctors also have said that I well could manage this all thing compared to the situation – he was smiling – By the way maybe the bullet also would hit me if I let you to stand before me, anyway, you reach only my shoulders! – they were laughing – But I wanted no take chances.
- I know. Me too.
- But you see that nor happened any big trouble that way. Now, when you are here, I’m completely fine and also, I can go home soon.
- Isn’t it even hurting you?
- No, it isn’t – he set up in the bed.
- Is it surely allowed?
- I’ve told you there isn’t any misery. Come, sit here – Heni set to the edge of the bed, they embraced each other and they were kissing long – You are who I would miss the most of all the world – Laurence was smiling after they stopped it and was still stroking Heni.
- I couldn’t live without you either. I have never been afraid so much before like this.
- But you already don’t have to be afraid, nor because of the children. When the doctor left, I called one of my friends to take measures in connection with the bodyguards.
- Didn’t he inquire after why do you need so many bodyguards like this?
- I said him that I’ll tell him after they lock him up who is the reason of they are necessary. It is better till them if it’s sure that that guy won’t get it know from anybody that there are so many bodyguards at our house, maybe he would bring more criminals in the end. But I think he doesn’t want anything anymore, he sees anything he does, and we still don’t treat Montana like anything wouldn’t happen. They are necessary only for the safety’s shake while the guy is at large. I already called the police when the doctor still hasn’t come in and they haven’t even notice that I woke up.
- Did you say them also to don’t tell anybody that they are already searching for him?
- Of course. And we already have seen his look so they’re surely going to find him.
- And why didn’t the guards stop him on any occasion?
- I not have an idea about this. It came into my head by this, Montana didn’t come in, did se?
- But she did. I met her in the corridor but I said the doctor to don’t let her in. There really can’t be big misery with you because she still didn’t come in to ask you about this and to send me out.
- They said the effect of the barbiturate lased so long that I don’t even need more rest till evening.
- So I can be here all day?
- You have to go home to the children sometimes.
- I know. When are the bodyguards going to arrive?
- Maybe already tomorrow.
- And only Jenny is guarding them till then?!
- Police also sent a bodyguard there, he is already there.
- But I still should go now, shouldn’t I?
- Stay a little bit. It’s so good that you are here – he pulled Heni to himself again and kissed her, and they said goodbye after kissing and embracing each other long again. After she left, a doctor asked Laurence if to let Montana in, but he said no of course.
	Montana was crying when she rang at David’s flat.
- That’s what I cal you did it! Dad doesen’T let me to go and see him also because my dear guy shot at him, because of me! – she shouted immediately when the boy nswered the door.
- Don’t yell, they may overhear that I did it!
- You still have the cheek to deal with yourself?! You should be happy if I will stay with you at all after these!
- We agreed with each order on I will find wich hospital he is and ask how is he and I did these! – the boy set down to the sofa of the dark living-room.
- How can be so lame like this?! You did this all thing to dad make it up with me, and the situation is even worse now! What did you think, if you’ll threaten him with kidnaping his child and if you’ll shoot at him, he is going to accept me?
- If it impossible to convince him of accept you it’s necessary to settle it to at least shut up and don’t nag you.
- You want to say you wanted to kill him?!
- No. Bu tif I didn’t shoot, he believed that I’m going to let him to try to talk you out of continue your career.
- You can settle the things very well! When I make you nervous, don’t you shoot at me?! I don’t believe it!
- If I know it well, you also ticked off pretty much when you were seeing like your ex-boyfriend’s ex-girlfriend began pushing to him.
- Didn’t happen anything trouble to the girl, I only beated her up a little bit and she wasn’t in the locked bathroom too much to die of thirst or something! She wasn’t even taken to hospital! But you almost killed my father!!! Did you comprehend this?!!! Why have you got a pistol at all?! What kind of man are you?!
- If we’re at this subject, I also could tell you this.
- What are you driving at?!
- We hardly meet nowadays! You’re always busy by your job! You have sex with every kind of guy but you don’t spare time for your own one!
- It’s pretty strange, you didn’t have any problem with my occupation till now! You want dad to accept my job but you aren’t ready to this?! You were who took measures he not to quip me because of this, as an addition, you wanted it so much that you were quite capable for kidnapping his child and shooting him!
- I don’t have problem with you do porn, just with that you are a lot more with your colleagues than with me!
- I already really not going to feel like meeting you after it came out what a criminal you are! It’s also even questionable if I will forgive you for what things you did! – then Montana left and slammed the door.

	Heni was in the hospital with her husband every day, almost all day. While the man was in hospital, press and his fans inquired after how he was, when she went to him and when she went home. They tried more times to get it out of her that who and why shot him but she always said that she still couldn’t tell this. One day, after she went home from the hospital, she didn’t run to the children to try to make up for the time she spended without them, while Jenny already left for a half an hour because they thought she is going to arrive come home earlier. But she went to the housekeeper who was just doing the washes in the kitchen after dinner. Heni fed up these mournful days when she always sat next to her injured husband, what rememberrf her of that terrible event when David wanted to kidnap one of their children again and he shoot Laurence. These days kept her in continuous tension because of this, she still hasn’t get over the shock completely, while her husband was already beyond the critical condition. But she still wanted to be next to him because they would still miss each other.
- Hi… - Heni began, sounded shy.
- What would you like? – Allyssa asked surprised. She was the thirty-year-old housekeeper, she was little and thin, and she had long, blondish-brown hair what she was wearing in a ponytail. Educating children took so much time for Heni that they haden’t enough time to meet too much, and Allyssa was even wondering because she was seeing Heni in the kitchen where only the cook and were.
- I’m sorry about you stayed alone with the children for a half an hour, I planned to come home earlier and I forgot about Jenny already left. Was there a lot of problem with them?
- No, they was only quietly sleeping.
- So that’s OK… It’s such a shame that we have lived together for so long but we still haven’t have too much time to meet. Just Heni and the little ones completely take almost all my time up. It came into my head now that while I deal with the children and you do the housework, we could talk sometimes.
- And why did it come into your mind just now? – Allyssa laughed with wondering sound.
- I need somebody who I can talk to nowadays… - Heni said in a straightforward manner and she also felt awkward by telling something like this to someone who was almost completely stranger. Then the little ones was crying, she ran into the children’s room to them and brought them out. Allyssa just has finished washing up – Will you take one of them?
- I can really take it? – she asked while she was almost laughing – I have never taken any so little children like them.
- Of course – Heni was smiling, she explained how to do it and handed to little Laurence over her. She wanted to be in a familiar relation with Allyssa.
- However, I maybe would be forced take one of them up if it was necessary while you weren’t at home – they went to the dinning room, set down and succeed to reassure them who stopped crying at last, and they took them back into the children’s room.
- It’s maybe strange but nowadays it isn’t so much but I still don’t have any child in my age. However, I nor have husband. I have had a partner once, and now I have a boyfriend since not long time ago – she returned the familiar talking.
- And do you have enough time to meet him? Don’t we give too much time from your life?
- I was who decided to choose this work. If I was a better student then in the secondary school and they admitted me to a university, I maybe didn’t have to work that much. But, in the other hand, they can be envious in that respect that I work for the Fishburne family – she laughed.
- I would quite capable so many things to this, then, when Laurence didn’t even know about my existence! – Heni was remembering – And now I almost lost him. At least, to me it’s still like it would be now while it happened already a week ago that Montana’s guy shot at him… and wanted to kidnap one of the children… - she paled with the remembrance again.
- It was really very outrageous – they told it her because she didn’t tell anything what she saw and hear int he famous house, and, she would hear about the events by them anyway – You’re still very broke down because of this? – Heni only noded.
-  I know a cert solution for this. Tonight I’m going to party with some of my friends, you could come with us too. You need it to make yourself forget this situation, to feel good at last and leave this tense mood by some booze and dance!
- Ooh, it took me by surprise! To tell the truth, I have never been at any real party and I have never drunk too much either... But it sounds pretty good, I have always desired it, and I just never have had any suitable friends for this – Heni said cheerfully.
- You’re kidding! I’m the thirty-year-old girl and you are who don’t party while you are twenty-three years old?! – Allyssa asked with playing jokes on her.
- But I’m a married wife; I don’t even have enough time for this because of the children. What will be with them during this?
- I have an idea. Call Jenny to say her she can have a party at you till we’ll come home, or even longer!
- But how could she look after the children during having a party?
- You and Laurence have always could trust her, she surely can solve it, don’t worry about this! Just come with us and feel good at last!
- Well, OK. I’m calling Jenny- Heni cheerfully ran upstairs like a teen girl. Jenny had time for this and was happy about she could have a party in the house of a celebrity where she “only” took care of his children till then. She promised to sometimes take a look of them during it, if it will be necessary, she will set her phone to remember her to take a look of them to get know if they need something, she will set it to trembling because of the loud music, from time to time. She also promised to won’t set the music very loud not to disturb them too much.
	Heni told everything Allyssa after coming back from upstairs.
- So you see that you unnecessarily worried. And now come, we’re putting up make-up! I think you haven’t been made up so much if you’ve never been at a real party! – Allyssa called Heni into her own room where Heni has never been. She was so kind and informal; Heni didn’t even hope they will get on so well with each other like this. Allyssa made her up and when she was ready and Heni looked in the mirror, she didn’t even recognize herself.
- It isn’t me! – she was laughing – It looks pretty good, you’re very clever but isn’t it a problem if I’m erasing a bit of this?
- If you fell better that way…
- But won’t you be offended, will you?
- Certainly not! But I’m better to putting up a lot of make-up because how would I look in a disco with my young friends while I’m so old like this! – Allyssa was playing jokes on Heni – Choose something cool clothes during this and show it me, I’ll tell you what is going to be good, I’m already a skilled in party-ing!
- OK! – Heni ran upstairs and selected her clothes she found proper at the occasion, then helped Jenny out with bathing the little ones and putting them to sleep, and they also persuaded their older sister to go to bed yet. She already had a bath earlier.
	Then Heni returned to Allyssa with the chosen clothes, who chosen the most striking one between all of them: a dark pink, glittering short dress without straps. The other girl took a similar one up, just it was black and had a strap, hanged it on her neck. Before they set, Allyssa called her friends.
- Get ready because tonight we’re going to party together with a special girl! However, it isn’t even necessary to get ready for it too much because she lives even simpler life than us, practically it is going to be her first real party in her life. But she’s really a pretty nice girl. I think you are already suspecting that she can be someghing celebrity but you know that I work for a star who isn’t a girl but his wife is going to come with us. Tonight Laurence Fishburne’s wife, Heni is going tjo be with us, personally! – it was heard by Allyssa’s mood that she already has drunk, but Heni liked to hear that they was talking about her a so special person like this, when she heard the phone conversation. Her life was till then that she was at home with her husband and the children expect that some occasion when paparazzos took some photo about her and Laurence because they know her husband.
	Allyssa, after finishing the conversation, persuaded Heni to drink a bit too after they will set, and Jenny already began preparing the living-room for the party for a while. When she was already waiting for her guests, Heni and Allyssa set. They were going with the girl’s car, they gave her friends a lift on the way: they were Lindsay, the twenty-five-year-old, brunette, tall girl, Britney, the twenty-six-year-old, black-haired girl who was middle-heighted, and Lisa, the twenty-four-year-old, little, blond girl. They were still restrained before the party, but later, when they already had drunk more, they were shrieking and shouted that they were here with Laurence Fishburne’s wife, they was constantly dealing with her, made her drunk and called her to dance, and Heni also felt very good. She has never enjoyed so much like then. She and the girls were dancing all night and the drink made her forget her every problems.
	They were going home with Allyssa, by the car.
- So what was it like? – she asked.
- I was under the influence of alcohol for the first time – she was laughing – But I’m not drunk, am I?
- Were you conducting yourself like who you were thinking to be drunk? – Allyssa was laughing too.
- I don’t know, I’m hardly conscious; you were who were seeing me.
- You still don’t know what it’s like when you are hardly conscious! Whe saw that you didn’t’ do anything what would suggest you would be drunk!
- So that’s OK! – Heni was laughing.
- By the way, you should rather worry about how much I drank because I am who’s driving, in the end.
- How much did you drink?
- Calm down, not too much. We’re already here – Allyssa didn’t go through the gate by car, she only parked next to the house and she did it this way also then. They went on foot through the huge gate and when they stepped in the living-room, they were seeing that Jenny’s party also had come to an end, any guest wasn’t there already. She was sleeping on the sofa what was pushed to the wall; she was waiting for she can go home. Every piece of furniture was pushed aside and there were alcohol bottles everywhere.
- I hope she will clean these away – Allyssa was laughing at this too, under the influence of alcohol.
	They had a shower in their own bathrooms. This enjoying was good. Heni felt like a young girl again. As an addition, she felt it so much like never before. She sobered a bit by having a shower and she was considering about if she should wake Jenny up to tell her she already can go home or let her sleep.
- What do you think, what should we do with her? – she asked Allyssa who was also coming out of the bathroom, to the living-room. She thought Jenny drank so much that she was sleeping fast so she spoke loudly but the girl woke up by this, she was speaking in glowing terms about the party she could have here, in the Fishburne house, then said goodbye, went home, and Heni and Allyssa went to sleep too.
	Heni was spending her time with the children next day, till afternoon. When it was the more little ones’ turn, she was talking with Allyssa, and, in the afternoon, she went to Laurence and was there till evening. She told him she felt so bad because of this shape nowadays, because they shot at him and he was in hospital, that Allyssa persuaded her to go to party together, she has never been at a so big party like this and was feeling very good but she was already missing him so she is going to be with him almost till far into the night. Laurence was happy about his wife has felt so good like this and she wasn’t constantly sitting next to his bed also then, and he told it Heni but he also admitted that he was missing her too to meet. The only thing he was worrying about was that she wanted to go home late evening, alone, and Heni was afraid of he will think bad things about she once went to party like something teen girl who hasn’t got any duty, while she was a married wife.
	Both of these anxieties were unnecessarily. Laurence tried to talk her out of staying so long not to happen anything on the way but Heni wanted to be with him long in the hospital and she really arrived in home in safety. She told Jenny she is going to be in the hospital long and asked her to wait for her, she said she can sleep there if she would like to.

12

	Heni’s days continued that way through the week, only she earlier went to Laurence in order to go home earlier.
	On Friday, Allyssa and her friends were going to go to a party, and Heni couldn’t put up resistance to the chance to going with them. She solved this night that way that the children slept at the friend of the little Heni, anyway, Allie and the parents were happy about a bit of dealing with babies. Heni was feeling very well at the party again, with Allyssa, Lindsay, Britney and Lisa, and strangers went to her to say: “You’re really Laurence Fishburne’s wife?!” and similar things. She felt like a celebrity. 
Next day Britney and Lisa persuaded Allyssa and Lindsay, and Allyssa persuaded Heni to repeat the night.
- Anyway, you would sitting idly next to your husband’s bed and also, you need a bit of variety – she said in the living room during ironing, while Heni was clothing the little Laurence and Loretta on the sofa.
- You really deserve some entertainment after you work so much but I like to be with Laurence and the children. And what could I do with Heni and the little ones during this? – Heni asked – I just can’T call Jenny for the night again and it also would maybe odd a little bit if the children were sleeping at Heni’s friend again.
	Allyssa’s friends took their friends too so more people would there. Heni was calm because she was at home with the children and she didn’t let anybody to set the music too loud. And dancing and drink made her forget during the party that Laurence lied in hospital with bullet wound. The others cheerfulness, because they could party in a famous movie star’s house, with his wife, also made her cheerful so she didn’t drink too much either at this occasion, and she let it herself neither. She still breastfed the little ones, and her religion forbids the drunkenness anyway.  Anyway, she couldn’t let herself the hangover, she had to look after the babies and deal with them and the little Heni, she already depended on Jenny’s help many times till then too.
	Next day, when she got up, she didn’t even need the hangover to feel terrible. It completely tired her that she danced till night twice, till yesterday night and till that day’s night too, and this time she had to put the children to sleep more times again during the party, when the guests were too loud.
	She hardly had vigor to begin the duties again be linked the little ones and their older sister. She was exhausted during taking Heni to the nursery school and taking her home, during playing with her, breastfeeding, and changing the babies, putting them to sleep, and she arrived to Laurence in the hospital with having rings round her eyes. She already didn’t even dare to tell him that she has party again, she also was remorseful subsequently because of the children, because they couldn’t sleep well by the guests. When she reported him about the previous occasion last day, Laurence said her to don’t carry it to extremes but he still hasn’t been angry with her then at all, he just called her attention to this. He totally understood that his wife spends her time with looking after the children and sitting idly next to his bed in the hospital every day and that she needed some variety but Heni was afraid about he already won’t understand this much of partying.
- What happened? You seem to be tired? – Laurence asked immediately after Heni arrived at the ward and they said hello.
- I went to bed late yesterday.
- Why? Were the little ones crying?
- They woke up more times at night and I had to put them to sleep again – she didn’t lie in the ned. She could never lie to Laurence. However, she couldn’t lie to anyone else either.
- Poor! I’m going to can go home son and help you out with looking after them – the man said and stroked her hair back, sense of guilt was visible on her. If he knew how well she enjoyed and was enjoying tonight too while he lied in the hospital… - Is there something problem? – Laurence noticed his wife’s odd look.
- Don’t should I to be with you more?
- You have to look after the children too.
- Who and how often visit you?
- Tom has been at me two times, sometimes my mother, Langston and Delilah, my closer friends often come in the morning because I’ve told them that you come in the afternoon. They don’t come every day either so I study my role till you arrive.
- Don’t we take up your time from this?
- I’ve told to the others they didn’t have to come so often, anyway, I have to get ready for filming, so I have more time for get ready already.
- I love that you’re so persistent that you work when you’re injured – Heni eulogized, being head over heels in love, and kissed her husband- But wouldn’t you recover faster if you rested more?
- The doctors didn’t say it so it surely doesn’t matter too much.
- Do they know at all that you get ready hard for the filming here, in the hospital?
- If it interested them so much, they could be even in the ward with me to look after if I’m resting or not or they could just simply look for in the net if is it still relevant that I’m going to play in the movie. If yes, I evidently get ready for this. By the way, it’s only mental work, so I think it doesn’t matter much if it wears me out, at least now when I’m already better. But you’re sweet that you anxious about me so much like this – the man was smiling and kissed Heni. They talked and kissed each other a lot at every visit. 
Heni went home almost at late night this time too but she arrived safely by taxi at this occasion too. Jenny was looking after the children till then, anyway, she went bad late and she lived just in the adjoining house.

13

Heni got up at nine in the morning, breastfed and changed the babies, had a breakfast with the little Heni, took her to the nursery school, Jenny was looking after Loretta and the little Laurence during it. She went home, went into a shop on the way, and when she arrived in home, and only put the clobbers to the cupboard like she usually did because of the many duties of educating children, the magazine she bought, fell out of the carrier. She usually read magazine, used the internet or watched TV through about a half an hour when any children didn’t need her “services” and she wasn’t in the hospital with Laurence.
	She took the magazine up from the floor, and when she noticed what was on the front page, almost dropped it back to the floor. They wrote: “Scandal: Laurence Fishburne’s young wife is beside herself with joy”. Heni’s heart began terribly fast beating and she began to feel giddy. She was terrified while sitting down and leafed it through to get to know what they could write about her. She almost fainted. They wrote that maybe the only reason of she married the actor who was much older than she, was the luxury, and then, when he was in hospital, she enjoyed that he wasn’t at home with her and that she could use the house to what she wanted to. Also, she let some strangers into the house, to party, who could look around and take some photos of the house, what they could make public on the internet without Laurence’s approval. It also raised up connect her husband was in hospital with her partying, that she also cheated on him with a something young boy because she was bored with her twenty-nine-year-old husband. As an addition, they also wrote that she was fed up with her middle-aged husband because she had to live as his wife for the luxury’s and fame’s sake, that she celebrated that they shot him. Heni was only sitting and trembling on the sofa almost through an hour, with reading and considering about the events again and again, and considering about what to do. Then she took her phone out with trembling hand and still being in something mood like panic, and called Laurence. It was better if he’ll get it to know by her than by strangers or anyone else.
- Hi! What is the reason of you called me? – the man’s cheerful, surprised voice was heard.
Heni usually didn’t cal him because the children took her time up so much.
- I have to tell you something – she said with trembling voice, with being frightened to death.
- Why, what happened? – Laurence got frightened. He was afraid of something happened to one of the children.
- I partied yesterday too.
- I’ve told you that you shouldn’t carry it to extremes. But they didn’t recognize you, did they?
- They did recognize me and they wrote all sorts of horror about me in the today’s news – she told it already then during crying.
- What??? – it was beginning again. He already had to be ashamed of his wife too. He couldn’t trust anybody of his family members??? – Didn’t even come into your mind to hide somehow who are you?
- No – Heni was sobbing. It came into her head just now. Allyssa even could help them by exaggerated make-up beyond recognition and also, she could ask her for don’t tell anybody who she was – I just wanted to come out of this mood that I constantly feel about that night when they shot at you and wanted to kidnap the children, this was why I fled to partying so it would make my problems forget!
- You still would had to beware. You have to learn that you can’t live that way if you were someone’s wife who isn’t famous. By the way, you shouldn’t party systematically either, while you are a married wife, even if you’re young.
 - But I endures it so hard that they shot at you and you still haven’t recover that I must flee because I love you so much, even if you’re a lot of years older than me!
- And what did they write about you?
- They wrote that horrors that I’m happy about you are in hospital because I fed up with I have to live as your wife for the luxury and fame, like I would marry you because of these, like I wouldn’t love you while I’m twenty-three years old and you are fifty-two and I celebrated that you were injured, maybe I did even cheat on you! – Heni said with crying and being indignant at what they wrote – And that I utilized that the house was mine this time and I let strangers in who could take the photos of the house to the net…
- You let strangers into the house?! People said again that they love me or what?! – Laurence asked, sounded angry.
- No, I was just so lonely without you and I became friends with Allyssa, who I had a party with once at home, and her friends and their friends also came.
- This all partying-thing was her idea?
- Yes, but she just wanted to jolly me because I always think of you, that you lie in the hospital injured…
- And who allowed her to call people into my house who I don’t know?! Besides, that’s your house too, why didn’t you spot this?! You didn’t even think about the consequences?!
- I’m sorry, I wanted to flee from that mood and I didn’t think it… - Heni said with regretting.
- We’ll talk about this later. Now we should react somehow on these horrors. You will call the magazine and tell everything. That would put the lid on it if they have to come to me and saw me being injured after these. If it’s necessary, Allyssa also will tell what happened, It’s more credible that way. But I’ll invent what to do with this girl. And I think you know you’re better to don’t party through long time.
- OK, but it isn’t Allyssa’s fault. She only wanted me to feel better. She was so kind and she works for us all day and she never leak anything out about our personal life.
- I’m going to invent what to do. After all, she let strangers into the house and I think she didn’t even try to stop you in partying systematically. As an addition, she was who persuaded you to do it. And you also could have more mind. That puts the lid on it after Montana’s scandal…
- If it’s necessary, I promise you I’ll never party again, just don’t be angry with me! You know that the reason of I fled to this, was how much I love you! Or you don’t even believe this?
- I don’t know what to think anymore. We’ll talk to each other later. Bye…
- Bye..

	Heni didn’t want to believe that Laurence already didn’t trust her. The feeling of loss of that confidence what was in their marriage was over, this feeling of loss followed that she was broke down because they shot at him and he was in hospital. She was looking after Loretta and the little Laurence and taking their older sister to Allie and back dopily by the grief because of this. She didn’t want to call her and her parents there because she didn’t want them to see her terrible state of mind. Also, she was afraid of her parents also have read what they have written about her so they don’t allow their daughter to meet the little Heni anymore, but she hasn’t seen any change on her parents. It came into her head by this that she had to call the magazine and tell everything. She didn’t even know how to do a thing like this. Was it enough to tell it on phone or she has to meet only Laurence if he telephoned? And what to say at all before setting about it? She was already so undecided in everything, about what she could do and what she couldn’t do, and how to do it, after she made that mistakes in connection with partying.
	It came into her head that she’d better to send an e-mail because she wouldn’t be so anxious but Laurence said her to call their so she didn’t dare to do it anything else way. She immediately took her phone out and wrote the number, and she was trying to pull herself together to press the call button, but she was only sitting on the cream-colored bed of the bedroom and was considering about how she should begin it, what to say and how to say it. Then it came into her head that she’d better to take measures as soon as possible so Laurence would don’t find any fault with also that how much time she waited with this, and also, she would be over of this awkward conversation sooner that way. Who she was going to talk to, believed her to be a selfish, vicious, self-seeking cow. She will never be over of this conversation, however soon she’ll call them soon and finish the conversation. She will never absorb it. When she was a teenager, the reminiscences of awkward situations used to haunt her, and this one was going to be simply humiliating. But she couldn’t be slow in doing it. She should do it as soon as possible for Laurence. She had to tell it so he wouldn’t have to be ashamed of at least her wife doing.
	She pushed the call button and she felt the tense in every part of her body. After the other one introduced himself, she began speaking like a little girl who was frightened, how she felt.
- Good afternoon, I am Henrietta Fishburne… - then her mind went completely blank.
- I think you’re telephoning because of the today’s article – a young man’s voice was heard.
- Yes… - she was like a shy little girl. She wasn’t like a party-girl at all.
- Do you would like to arrange a time to meet? – Heni would like to ask if she could manage it by phone but it came into her head that it may be more convincing, maybe they will judge her by this too in the magazine. She had to clean herself as surely as possible, for Laurence’s and her own interest. At least she surely owed Laurence to do it that way, although, this awkward conversation may be enough to get it over with her penalty.
- Yes – she already felt awkward also because she could only blurt one word out. She has never been in a situation like this that they were going to make an interview with her, as an addition, about a so humiliate thing like this.
	After they talked it over when and where they’ll meet and finished the conversation, she was only sitting on the bed with feeling embarrassed again. She was considering about if this shyness how she was speaking could indicate that she was ashamed of they thought she did or that she wasn’t quite capable of doing anything like these.
	Some minutes later she pulled herself together that much to go downstairs to the children. Even if it will get into the news what this phone conversation was, even if it won’t, it also mattered to her what this even one person thought her, even if till the interview.
	When she arrived downstairs, it came into her head that she hasn’t look after the children through more than an hour. Although, the little Heni was in nursery school so only the little ones were at home then so they maybe didn’t need her.
- Allyssa, didn’t one of the babies cry? – she asked when she arrived downstairs in the living-room.
- Only the little girl cried a little bit, I set to the children’s room to calm her down but she already stopped it – Allyssa answered during cleaning the hall.
- Thought you! – she said gratefully – Now… I hadn’t got too much time to look after them and I completely forgot about them. It wouldn’t be your duty to also look after them, I’m already going to be available for them – she gave excuses for it confusedly.
- You don’t have to look after them so much. You see that they do well without you too. By the way, what happened to you? You’re so strange and we haven’t even talk to each other today – Heni sat to the sofa, stroked her hair back and sighed – OK, you’d better to stop working during this, then I’ll help you continuing it to id don’t last more than it does – normally Allyssa would wondering because of this because she has never seen Heni doing any housework since she has knew her. She always has been instead of her, it was her duty, they’ve played her well, she wouldn’t have enough time for this with the three little children, anyway. But now it wasn’t that what interested her, but that what happened what concerned her too.
	Allyssa sat to the sofa next to her and Heni told everything: what they’ve written in the magazine about her and what things Laurence said to this.
- I’m sorry about I involved you into a situation like this… I really only wanted to help you because you were so much broke down.
- I know and also, I’ve said it to him.
- I was total stupid when I let those strangers in. I could have enough mind but desire for flight blinded you, to flight from that mood what you were in. And I maybe have drunk too much then so I couldn’t think at least so big trouble like then…
- And you too…
- I’m surely going to find another work, at least if it won’t turn out how much irresponsible I was. If it will turn out, I will work those people who aren’t famous or I will have a completely different job but your relationship grew worth with your husband and they’re lying all sorts of horror in that magazine. And who knows where they are doing it too.
- But I would like you to stay. We became so good friends.
- I also would like us to stay being friends but even f Laurence will discharge me, he surely isn’t going to be happy about if we stay being friends after these.
- How do you know him? What do you think, is he going to forgive you it?
- We’re only simple acquaintances since I’ve worked here. We don’t talk to each other so much and we don’t go to enjoy ourselves with each other. I know him for less time than you.
- But was there anything before this thing what he didn’t like in connection with you?
- No, there wasn’t… So I have no idea about what he will do now. Maybe I will get less pay and if it won’t be enough to me, I can go… Or he’ll simply sack me. But I don’t believe I won’t get any punishment – they were sitting on the sofa with reflecting through a minute, then Heni began to speak.
- Well, OK, let’s continue cleaning the living-room up! – they stood up, Heni called Jenny to come looking after the little ones and going for their older sister to the nursery school, then she took another one mop, and the two girls were suppressing all of their tense to cleaning the living-room up. They were scrubbing everything so much what wasn’t even necessary but at least this diverted their thoughts from Laurence’s anger and from what they’ve written in the magazine.

	On the day of the interview, it immediately came into Heni’s head when she woke up, what was going to be, and she was even much more anxious since then, than before at school before oral examination. Her feet were trembling when she got out of the taxi and arrived in the place they had to meet. She was wearing a white top what reached to her neck and a long, pale pink skirt. She nor had the cheek take any less restrained clothes on because of the man who was going to make the interview, after they’ve written those things about her. Even if he won’t write it down what she was wearing, and he also could take these clothes if it was true what they’re stating or supposing, to make them believe she didn’t do anything like these because she wasn’t this kind of person and it was appearing on her clothes too. So it maybe was of no too much significance but she felt better with this innocent appearance.
	She had to sit down with a bit tall, brown-haired, about thirty-five-year old man at an open-air glass table of a coffee bar. Heni was waiting with alarmed look to he ask her his humiliating questions. If her allegedly scandalous partying wasn’t be, the man even didn’t believe on the basis of her look that she went to party sometimes and if he didn’t see to who Laurence’s wife was, what it was possible to know her at all, he believed she was an actress because she seemed to be so gentle and unprotected like this, that she was surely pretending this. He was already less thinking it to be probable that those were true they’ve written about her.
- I think the reason of you contacted us is to refute what we’ve written about your parties during your husband, Laurence Fishburne is in hospital.
- Yes – she said in a low voice and shyly, but her eyes were revealing the indignation.
- So did this all thing how happen? Why did you began to party in public in this period?
- Because of this. I agreed to these relaxations by my very kind friend’s encouragement so these would make me forget that my husband lies in hospital by gunshot wound because… - she became embarrassed because she had to tell her feeling for the world so much like this but it could be important, to clean herself so she continued it – because it always remembered me of that shot when I was visiting him and I still couldn’t absorb what they did to him. I didn’t think about they thought I was happy about this happened to him and also I didn’t get to that I should be in hiding like I would be a celebrity like my husband so I nor had any experience in this. My friend who I’ve talked about, made me up beyond recognition but I made that mistake that I erased some of this so people who have seem me in photos about my husband and me, also recognized me. Although, most of people don’t know me by photo, they know only by repute who I am – then it just came into her head that Allyssa told it her friend and they trumpeted in the big partying but she didn’t want to offend them by blame them. They were surely going to read what Heni said in connection with this business. Fortunately the man didn’t attach importance to if they knew someone by repute and they recognize her, they knew her look. Expect in this case, when Allyssa’s friends were crying at the party that she was Laurence’s wife. So Heni didn’t have to tell him that they did it. That man thought Heni was worded this way by chance.
- In this case we’re sorry about we published negative suppositions. And I think this news that you’ve cheated your husband, was also a mistake if you love him so much like this.
- Yes – Heni said with completely indignant look and voice. The man believed it but anyway, he would pretend what things she was saying by politeness and for the peace’s sake what was necessary to continue the interview, if he didn’t believe it – Because of we’re already here, tell a little bit about what way you met! – Heni felt awkward because she had to share with the world so many things like this but if she didn’t tell it, maybe they thought that it was a marriage of convenience, that this was the reason of she wouldn’t like to detail their relationship’s beginning – I was a teen girl from Hungary who felt unrequited love and who spend some weeks in America by a lottery prize we got from my grandparents. It was already on my mind that I should meet Laurence somehow, I was already completely fallen for him on the basis of I’ve read on the internet and the videos and of course on the basis of his look - she was remembering with being head over heels in love – I spend very much time with searching for his house he lived then in New York, Washington Heights, and one day I found it – she laughed – I used to walk in front of his house, maybe he notices how many times I used to do it but I didn’t linger in front f the gate, I used to use the territory in front of the house as a passage while I used to walk because I wanted it to be as suspicious as it was necessary – she was smiling – One day the housekeeper has noticed me, then she remarked that I used to walk in front of the house suspiciously many times. I was completely beside myself with joy but I was so much anxious! – she was laughing – She took pity on me so I succeeded to persuade her to don’t tell it to Laurence till it won’t happen one more time. But I couldn’t stop it. The aim was to meet him and I couldn’t forget this so I continued to walk in front of his house, and when I noticed Him personally, I haven’t be a party to anything like this before that he has seen ma there already more times but I was so big fan of him like this and he offered me to be friends but when I told him that I’m Hungarian and I was in America only through a few time, I was suspecting that it was not going to come true. Later I went shopping with my family, who still didn’t suspect anything, and he unexpectedly pulled me to an alley not be striking that he was meeting me and told me that he wanted more than friendship. My parents didn’t even know where I was but already anything wasn’t interesting me then – Heni was laughing – We went to a desolate park where he meets his star friends, we began talking during it and we still haven’t stop this there. We fell in love already that day and became a couple – love was very visible on Heni while she was talking about Laurence and their love – We are still in love – she admitted with smiling shyly. She thought it was better that she told everything what was in favor of she didn’t marry Laurence by interest but after she said these, it came into her head that Laurence maybe didn’t even love her anymore because he was so disappointed in her…
- And is everything OK in your marriage? – the man noticed that her mood suddenly changed.
- When I told him what like article was published, he got very angry with me because I partied so many times and because I let strangers in the house. Only these are true in the article and he know it. I also told him that the only reason of I did these, was that I still haven’t absorb what happened to him and I trust after I cleared myself, he will forgive. Now I told the truth to the world and this depends on them if they will believe me. I already can’t do anything more.
- To tell the truth, I believe you and I hope the other people also will feel like this when they will read this interview because I think what you said were credible and I met a nice, sincere, honest woman – this opinion change of the magazine could be interesting for the readers so he could not leave it out of this but he really thank it like this.
- Thank you – Heni felt relief by the man said these, even if he really thought this, even if not because she hoped that his opinion also will get in the magazine.
	They said goodbye, Heni called a taxi and while she was waiting, she was thinking the conversation over again and again, also because she was still anxious because of this was her first interview of her life. She was still worrying too about if Laurence will forgive her. In the end she had to take part in the first and probably last interview in her life about this humiliating subject like this. She would be very-very anxious only in a simple interview too… She wanted people so much to believe her, in the end that she wasn’t even almost that person what like she seemed to be in the previous article and she wanted Laurence so much to forgive her.

16

	She went to the hospital by the taxi to spend the rest of her time with Laurence, even if her time was less because of the interview than it usually was and because she could not go on anymore that she still hasn’t know if Laurence was still angry with her. She would do anything to remedy that lot of public partying and that she let the strangers in the house, in order to her relationship with Laurence be the same like before. After she got out of the taxi, pay the taxi driver, went into the hospital and she was already near the man’s ward, it came into her head that she had to rescue Allyssa too from Laurence’s anger. It wasn’t only about she had time only for her because of the children, that she was the only one who she could talk to, while looking after the little ones during she’s doing the housework and who knows if she’ll get on well with the next housekeeper and anybody didn’t know in which age group she will rank among. If it leaks out that Allyssa’s made a mistake, it is going to be hard to her to find a job again where they will employ her with these news. In the end, this was her only blunder and the reasons of she made it, were that she wanted to help her and that she drank a bit before the party.
- Hi – Heni said timidly to her husband when she arrived. She didn’t know what to count on from him.
- Hi – Laurence’s voice was expressionless.
- I’ve settled what you asked me for – his wife sat down to the chair next to his bed – I just came from the interview.
- And what do you think, how was it successful?
- I was very-very anxious. I never took part in any interview before. But in the end I succeed to convince at least that man of the truth, who made it, so the readers may believe me too.
- Did you tell everything about how it happened?
- I told everything what was important. He also asked me how we met and I felt really awkward because of this but I rather told it too because I wanted him to see that I married you by love. I did everything I could because I wanted you not to stay in shame because of me. And I’m so sorry about I brought you to a situation like this, you didn’t deserve it at all and it just put the lid on it for you, mainly nowadays! Is it disturbing you very much that the strangers have seen and maybe made the furniture of our house public without our permission?
- Well, I’m not happy about this too much. I hardly have any personal life without this too since I became more famous…
- If you want, we’ll furnish the house again, that way how you want, I won’t intervene anything.
- This would really make sense only if we’ll look for if they took any photos where in the house is well visible inside, look for if they’ve made them public, and if they did, we should make it public that we changed the furniture in order to they know that they don’t know how our home looks like precisely. It would be enough to change only some things so they would only think what stayed the same and what didn’t.
- I’ll look for on the net if they’ve put there any photos like these. They surely have done this if they wanted.
- And you’re not going to party through a long time, but never so often like this and you’re not going to let any strangers in the house without you would talk it over with me.
- I promise. What I have to do more in order to you forgive?
- I think this humiliation you got from that magazine and what you were suffering during the interview, were enough to be a lesson to you and also, I know normally you wouldn’t do anything like these.
- It only shook me so much what happened to you! So can you forgive?
- I admit that when you still haven’t arrive, I was still angry with you but then I realized that the consequences of your acts, affected you at least so much like it affected me. And you are so sweet also after I was so angry with you so I can’t be angry with you anymore – the man was smiling and kissed his wife.
- I was so afraid of I spoiled everything in connection with us! I love you and I will never run the risk of our relationship being bad anymore.
- I love you too – he kissed Heni again and they were kissing through long time. Everything was OK between them again and they were happy.

	Heni also succeeded to persuade Laurence to don’t discharge Allyssa. Although this took some days to him to decide about her fate, in the end he decided to give her one more chance and didn’t dismiss her, for Heni’s sake, in order to stay be her this one friend at least who she got not long ago but she was a very good friend, and because this was her only blunder, as an addition she did it because she wanted to help Heni. He still hasn’t invented what should be her punishment but he had enough time for this in the hospital. Although the doctors said he was probably going to can go home already on this week, he still had some days. He already made headway with studying his role so he already had more time to receive Heni and his friends. The period of Heni’s despair because of Laurence’s injury, was already over, mainly because she knew that he could even go home soon, and they enjoyed every minute of her visits in the hospital because they could spend these together. These already didn’t remember Heni of that scary night when they shot at the man and they wanted to kidnap one of their children again. The married couple holds it high esteem that everything was Ok between them and they loved to be together.

	They decided to keep it secret that the police searched David so the boy wouldn’t get ready for this, and mainly so he wouldn’t take vengeance on them for they reported him. Although he would only impair his situation by the latter one but anybody didn’t know what was on his mind. Who would thing that he will even take vengeance on Heni for she didn’t talk kindly to Montana? Mainly that he’ll do it with a dangerous shot like this… But the whole family was already in safe between the many body guards: anybody couldn’t kidnap Loretta, nor the little Laurence and probably didn’t plan to kidnap the little Heni because she would remember of his look and she could tell it. And he didn’t count on the parents will see him.
	Laurence worked a lot to make up for falling behind the other actors on the rehearsal, continuing the script memorizing what he already did in the hospital, took up a lot too. Besides he went to the new rehearsals too from home, and the filming was already going to begin next month.

	Heni also had a lot to do beside to educating the children: she bgan to work seriously in connection with setting up that foundation for those teenager girls who feel unrequited love towards a star.
- What are you still doing so late like this? – Laurence came into the bedroom.
- I didn’t want to tell you because you have so much duty nowadays and maybe we only would discussing about this again.
- And you think I wouldn’t get it know?
- I planned it to you get it know later.
- Would you tell me at last what are you talking about?
- I made preparations for set up the foundation.
- But you told you still won’t do it, didn’t you?
- I changed my mind about this. I was nor sure till now about I closed this thing but when I almost lost you, this made it come to my mind what it was feel like when we still weren’t be a couple, when I couldn’t even do too many things to you get it know that I existed.
- And when did you want to tell me that you are still going to set up this foundation?
- After the filming. You have so much duty nowadays, I didn’t want to burden you with this too.
- But you still did have to ask me about this. In the end, it’s also my money what you spend on this.
- I’m sorry. I haven’t reconsidered this enough. You work so much and I only spend the money how I want to – Heni embraced her husband.
- It’s only the smaller problem. I believed we aren’t going to have any secret for each other anymore, then you began to be secretive for me again.
- I wasn’t be secretive, I just didn’t disturb you with telling you this. I did the preparations here, in our bedroom till the end, you could whenever ask me about what I was doing and would tell you.
- I haven’t been too many times, nor too long in the bedroom nowadays because I have been busy by the much duty because of filming – Laurence said while he was taking his pajamas out and set to have a shower.
- This was why I didn’t want to disturb you with this! – Heni shouted desperately. When the man came back into the bedroom, his wife was bitterly sobbing during sitting on the bed.
- What happened? – Laurence was surprised.
- How did I want to spend a lot from that money what you have been worked hard for, without asking you about this?!
- This isn’t the essence. There would stay be enough of it. But I see that you already repented it so I don’t have to explain again that you did have to talk it over with me too.
- Of course I won’t continue the work to set up the foundation. I deserve that the work I worked for this, will be wasted – Heni continued when Laurence already turned the light off and went to sleep and his wife lied down next to him.
- I also thank till know that I’m not going to let you do it but now, when you regretted it so much like this, I allow you to set up that foundation.
- Is it sure that it isn’t problem?
- What trouble could be happen because of this? And it isn’t necessary to those teen girls go on suffering only because we had a conflict.
- I’m so happy about I’ve found something useful occupation at last! When I was a teenager, I used to imagine our marriage that way that when you are working, I’m only shopping and partying with my friends beside to educating children because I didn’t have any chance to choose my friends, because f my shyness. I was happy about these two friends who I had and they weren’t so modern, girlish in style than me. It just came into my head now: what is going to be Allyssa’s punishment?
- I even forgot to tell you that I already talked it over with her that she will get a bit less pay but she said she still stays. And don’t you need any entertainment with your friends anymore?
- Now, when I have children and this foundation too, I haven’t got too much time to deal with things like these. Also, I didn’t count on we will have so many children like this. But I love them even more than I imagined it, while I was already sure before that I will love them very much because they are our children, they are made up of us and this is even more wonderful feeling than I thought before! – Heni laughed – I don’t know what would happen to me if I lost anyone of them – she turned serious again.
- I will never forget that you stood before me when Montana’s guy wanted to shoot me – Laurence was stroking his wife’s hair and face.
- But you also stood before me!
- It was nor your fault.
- That’s true that it mostly wasn’t my fault but almost didn’t have to do with this at all.
- But I did. I couldn’t stand to lose you. I love you so much – she kissed her husband, they were stroking each other’s body during kissing, while they were taking the pajamas off each other’s pajamas.

	The police caught David soon. The world already got to know then what happened and also turned out that when he kidnapped Loretta, he threatened the guards with something to let him in, and at the second time, when he shot at Laurence instead of kidnapping, he got in the house also by this. The guards were so intimidated that they didn’t even dare to call the police. The twenty-four-year-old David Brown got nine years of imprisonment. Montana stayed be her girlfriend, by pity, and because that shot anyway wasn’t fatal what her father got from him, so she forgave this. Although, it wasn’t probably that she will wait for him through almost a decade.
	Press didn’t question Laurence about his daughter began again doing porn because these was news then, when he was still in hospital, and now everything turned out: Montana’s boyfriend kidnapped even his and his wife’s common little daughter because the man was ready to pretend he endured his older daughter’s occupation only by this, and his wife also has conducting herself hostilely with Montana, it seemed like so much that the boy shot who he even could of them, by revenge.
	Laurence got ready for filming so much in the future too that he hardly met Heni and he also had to spare time for Lucy for Heni’s sake, mainly because they didn’t even meet while he was in hospital. This situation affected him strange way that he had to deal with these two young girls too beside his job. One of them he wanted to meet, the other are didn’t even interest him. But he felt pride because he was who two so young girls wanted. Lucy was even younger than Heni… Tonight he dreamed about they were constantly changing each other in his life: sometimes one of them was his wife, sometimes the other was of them. He looked after the children, ha breakfast and dinner, was kissing, made love and talked to each other sometimes with Heni, sometimes with Lucy.
	He surprisedly woke up from the dream and got up and he was reflecting about this during taking his blue, long-sleeved T-shirt and his light blue jeans. Heni was still sleeping.
	The man realized that he hasn’t have any kind of connection with her for a long time ago because of the lack of his time, they only talked to each other one or two words, and, of course, he nor had any physical connection with other women. Maybe Lucy would even better than anybody?! Only because she had more time than Heni? He got afraid by this thoughts while he was trying to analyze his dream, but, after this, he realized that it didn’t matter anything. After he went downstairs to the children, he succeeded to calm himself down but he decided to don’t tell Heni anything about this, she maybe would believe something because of this what wasn’t true. When he was already holding the little Laurence and Loretta in his arms and he was talking with the older little girl in the children’s room, he already even forgot that odd dream.
	Later Laurence went to the shop, then he already had to set to meet Lucy. That dream already didn’t even come into his mind on the way.
- It can be pretty outrageous that you hardly have any time, you have so much duty! – Lucy said when they have been talking to each other already for a while, during sitting on one of the benches of the desolate park. She was wearing deeply low-cutted neckline, dark pink top and white mini skirt – How much time does remail for your family or even for anything?
- Well, not too much.
- Well, now you can spending your free time that way you want to while we’re here!
- There isn’t too many things to do here… I thought it’s enought if we’re only talking. Or let’s go somewhere else?
- It’s OK to me how oyu want it. You deserve to do what you want at last. What do you want to do now?
- I think I’m better to already going – they stood up from the bench.
- I hope we meet sometime but let’s do something already then! – Lucy was stroking the man’s chest and thighs, and he bended close her to kiss the girl but it came into his head int he last moment that how much more he wanted seeing Heni’s face then, she was who he was missing. She was the only one who he wanted.
- We will never meet anymore you can be sure about this! – Laurence was drawing away from her. This girl already repulsed him because she made him and Heni believed she wasn’t only a mean bitch.

19

	Laurence set home without saying goodby, and when he arrived, immediately told Heni what kind of girl this Lucy was in the reality.
- She just reminded me of myself. She was seeming to be so desperate when the guards were leading her away and I really believed that she was just an unlucky little girl who loves you. I think there isn’t any love in her, she is just a bitch who likes you.
- She really didn’t behaved herself with me like who is in love, rather who only enjoys. I’ve thought of tell you but I thought you wouldn’t believe me, you so much pitied that little girl.
- Well, I don’t pity her anymore at all…. You’re not going to meet her anymore, are you?
- I told her that I never want to see her anymore.
- And how could you let her to push to you?
- We just stood up from the bench to say goody and go away, than se suddenly began stroking me.
- And what did you do?
- I’ve already told you: I send her away from my life.
- But you didn’t… return anything, did you?
- In the end, I didn’t.
- What do you mean “in the end”??? – Heni got frightened.
- I bended close to her to kiss her…
- What??? – Heni shouted sounded frightened.
- But I didn’t do it! – the man was shouting too.
- You almost became to be a couple with somebody??? You almost cheated on me?!
- You haven’t got any reason to break down because of this…
- But a kiss is already cheating for me! And you almost kissed that girl!
- And what will happen now? You will get divorced from me or what?!
- I don’t want sleeping with you in one bed today.
- Only because of this???
- And also, I don’t know what will be later.
- I don’t believe it! You’re conducting yourself like I would have sex with somebody else!
- I nor know why I feel like this but it very upset me… Just let’s sleeping separately, then I will invent what to do!
- OK, I’ll do what you want, just let this your stupidity over alt last!

	Heni was sleeping on the sofa, Laurence in the bedroom. But they were only trying to sleep. The man was considering about why his wife ticked off so much like this, only because he almost kissed  a girl. Anybody doesn’t shout with her husband becauseof this and she also wasn’t even ready sleping with him! And also, she didn’t know what will be after this???
	Heni was also considering about why this thing shocked her so much like this and about how she will get over this. They lived like a dream couple till then, they loved each other os much, they almost didn’t even look at anyobody else! This was simply too big change! Altough, they didn’t hav much time for each other nowadays, mainly Laurence didn’t have much time for Heni, so it still didn’t hapen so suddenly. But she was very disappointed int that girl who she used to pity so much and who she used to want to help her till then in the same time when she was also disappiointed in her husband, as an addition, they were who almost became a couple!
	Heni already felt like she was disappointed in herself. How could she expert her anger to her husband because of her own naivety that she was so sure of Lucy was a decent girl who needed help?! She was hoping the man nor was sleeping because of how she treated him that day, while she was going upstairs and softly opened the door and went into the bedroom in order to don’t wake him up if he was sleeping. She lied next to him and Laurence embraced her.

- I’m so happy about you changed your mind!
- I’m sorry, I conducted myself so stupidly! I was just disappointed in Lucy and you at the same time, as an addition… - the man kissed her what interrupted her in speaking.
- You don’t have to explain yourself. I didn’t even think you will forgive so soon like this.
- There’s nothing to forgive.
- But that girl almost succeeded to seduce me. But it came into my head in time that you are who I love; you were who I wanted to kiss, just we hardly have time for each other and she was who was there happen to be then. You could have reason to believe that I don’t love you anymore because we have hardly met nowadays so I didn’t say enough times that I’m still in love with you – he was stroking Heni’s face.
- Me too. I love only you already for many years – she was stroking the man’s chest, then she kissed Laurence and they began kissing. They didn’t do it for a long time till then.

	Lucy was offended for a while because Laurence rejected her and treated her that way, and she was disappointed because they weren’t going to meet anymore. Later she was laughing while telling the event to her friends.
- It isn’t even a man! I pushed to him, I, a girl, who is thirty-five years younger than him, as an addition, that time when he hardly had time for his wife too so he could be totally sharp-set, but in spite of these, he hardly moved in on me! – she said during sitting in her room, on her bed, when she was having a pajamas-party.
- His wife nor too much older than you so he could already get to it… Although if he really doesn’t have too much time for her… - the blonde girl said who was sitting on the carpet.
- While he is so many guy in everything, It’s loss. But this is his problem if he doesn’t take advantage of being with young girls.
- I think you’re just disappointed because he didn’t want you! – the brunette girl, who was sitting next to the blonde one, played jokes on Lucy.
- I don’t care about this one man, there are a lot of handsome guys too, they surely won’t pass me up!
- But I think it’s pretty romantic that he is so faithful with his wife like this! – the blonde girl was eulogizing.
- I will immediately vomit! – the brunette one was laughing, Lucy was laughing with her.
- The essence was that I succeeded to meet a world-famous move star, who, as an addition, looks pretty good! – she said proudly.
- Well, you have really queer taste. He could be your father…
- Yeah, easily – the blonde girl said.
- I don’t care! Mature, manly men are who interest me!
	The filming was a success, and when the movie came out in cinemas, the audience well received this too. A san addition, they also nominated Laurence for Oscar for the second time in his life. He took Heni with him to The Oscars, and she was very exciting about taking part in an event like this. She was wearing a very youthful, pink dress what reached to her knees.
- What am I doing here? I’m even not a star – she was embarrassed in the car during they were going to there. She felt the situation very awkward and was already regret having gone there.
- Other people also take their partner there.
- But almost every world-star’s spouse is a star.
- Who aren’t star, their husbands and wives also come – Laurence was trying to calm her down – And they won’t even know you aren’t actress; you’re at least as nice as them. Anybody can’t know every actress in the world.
- OK – Heni was sighing and became a bit calmer but she was still trembling by being excited. And when they arrived and they had to get out of the car to the red carpet, before the large number of people and cameras, she was at least as tight as before. She was trying to invent something in order to doesn’t have to go but anything didn’t came into her head and also, she hadn’t enough time to invent any objection. She felt like she will even faint out of the car but she gathered strength. She knew that the attention’s going to aimed at Laurence, not at her, and also, she was hearing that his fans were shouting his name but she has never been in a so spectacular situation like this, at any so huge event like this. She was trembling while she set on the red carpet with Laurence, with holding each other’s hand. The man was giving some autograph and Heni was only standing next to him and she was feeling herself completely unnecessary. She felt she must run away. As an addition, they were constantly taking photos of Laurence and she also got into some pictures and she became even more nervous because of this. She was already also afraid of they notice in these pictures how much embarrassed she was. As an addition, they could notice this already there and they may take some photos of her, specially, by herself, to guffaw at her and put it to the net. There wasn’t too much thing what was parting her from fainting. She was standing about with troubled, forced smiling next to her husband, with clutching his hand, just like she was hanging on to him. It was surely visible on her that she wasn’t an experienced actress who has been any kind of awards ceremony – came into her head. But they were maybe believing she was still in the beginning of her career, that this was why it was her first one and this was the reason of she was so excited like this – she was trying to calm herself down. What if some of them knew that she was a nobody – she got afraid after it. Or they weren’t sure in they were well remembering that she wasn’t a celebrity but then, when they were seeing what way she was conducting herself at an event like this, it has already clicked for them. But she couldn’t stop being excited, she couldn’t concealing this either. If only because this, while these were why she shouldn’t doing this. She was looking forward to they can sit down to their places and when this moment came and she could mingle with the large number of people, a lot o tension was over in her. The others just began becoming excited then, when they announced the nominated movies’ titles and was producing their trailers on the huge screen, than announced the winner. They were playing back the trailers of the best director’s movies too, and announced their name too, then the winner’s name. They did these with the best female co-stars too, the Oscar-winner came out from them too, then it was the best male co-star’s turn. Heni began keeping her fingers crossed for Laurence just then. They were excited while took each other’s hand and they were holding their breath while waiting whose name will they say.
- And the Oscar goes to Laurence Fishburne – Selena Gomez said on the stage, in long, blue dress. Heni’s heart almost jumped out of her. Laurence happily went to the stage and received his life’s first Oscar award. Heni was happy about the man’s happiness. He really deserved it, mainly with that he was in hospital while the others could get ready for the filming normally, with complete vigor. But she got afraid because it came into her head in the next moment that they maybe knew that she is his wife and they may shoot her too but came into her  head that there wasn’t too much chance for this. The film camera caught Heni exactly in time, when she already succeeded to calm down. Heni noticed it and she could hardly move. She was wondering for a while, and then it came into her head that they could see that they came there together and that they were sitting next to each other. She was so tight that sometimes couldn’t even properly think. It was a huge experience for her that her husband just won his first Oscar in his life and she was taking part in a awards ceremony for the first time in her life.
- Thank you for the director, Steven Spielberg and everybody who trusted in me that I could take part in the movie in spite of my special situation and thank you for my beautiful wife, Heni who heartened me by her many visits so I could get ready for this role in the hospital too – Laurence said. Heni was surprised and happy about he mentioned her too and she was shyly smiling when the TV camera was shooting her again.
- We can say to this that you carried that lot of working to extremes but it was worth the trouble – Heni said with laughing when they were already celebrating Laurence.
- And his talent was also necessary to this! – Tom completed it with smiling.
- We’ve knew it before too how talented he is – Heni was smiling too.
- We could really celebrate Heni too. I still haven’t even tell everybody that she set up a foundation for those teenager girls who feel unrequited love towards a star – Heni explained to Tom and to Laurence’s other friends too why these girls needed money.

	People soon began to know the strange foundation Heni set up and also, some offers already have come before they began to advertise it more than till then. Heni only has put a text to the net about the foundation till then but after she appeared on The Oscars with her famous husband, who won an award as the best male co-star as an addition, they began to pay attention to her. Although, not positively. They wrote things like the middle-aged movie-star’s wife was looking next to him like a teen girl, in that little-girlish dress, as an addition; she was looking even more little than she was, so the height difference was seeming to be even striker between them than it was. These remarks nor was aimed at Heni, only as at Laurence’s wife, that his wife was looking next to him like she would be his foster child. They wrote that it was a very bizarre sight that far from trying make the almost thirty years of age difference between us less visible, her wife seemed even younger than her age. The reason of they picked up on Heni, was the odd sight, and also this was the reason of they noticed how much uncomfortable she was feeling, it was how much visible that she hasn’t get to the celebrities’’ events. They also remarked how much rare it was between world stars that somebody’s partner wasn’t even famus and that Laurence was a special participant of this event also because her wife was famous at most by that foundation.
- I thought that this will be… - Heni said during sitting on the sofa in the living-room after they read these remarks they found partly on the net, partly in news.
- They’ll see how much famous you will be when your foundation will start more.
- What if you were who was in the commercial? In the end you’re actor and we wouldn’t have to pay anything in this case.
- You know that we don’t have to bother about money too much. And it would seem to be pretty odd if I encouraged people to the offering for those who aren’t as lucky as my wife…
- We’ve already talked about this when we were talking about why I am who set up this foundation. Those girls need a bit of hope because they could become totally depressed at the end.
- It still seems to be pretty bizarre to me.
- Maybe you’re right. So what do you think, who should speak in the commercial?
- In the end it could be even you. You don’t even have to put on airs because you also went through this.
- I??? – Heni was laughing – My head already totally trembles when somebody takes a photo about me! In this case it’s at least possible to solve it so it wouldn’t be visible but… - she was laughing again – It’s absurdity for me! I have too much stage fright.
- Anyway it’s necessary to make a change in this if you want to be stay a famous actor’s wife in the future too.
- I know, I’m sorry about that so big scandal what was because of what way I was conducting myself at The Oscars.
- I wouldn’t name it scandal. But you could choose a more adult-like dress too.
- You still didn’t say it me when I chosen it.
- I didn’t know that you were going to look in this next to me like a little teenager. I’ve looked at the photos and they’re right.
- OK, I nor knew it!
- If that age difference wasn’t what was even striker than usual, they maybe nor noticed how much excited you were.
- I constantly take shame to you because of the big age difference and because you’re star and I’m not…
- I’m sorry if I was rough, it wasn’t your fault either… But I’ve got an idea. Try to shoot some recording about yourself till this stage fright will be over enough so it wouldn’t be visible.
- It still would be a problem to employ an actor for this.
- No. Just there is your chance to be a bit braver.
- I’m not enough good to you that way like this?
- I just wanted to say you shouldn’t hide this so much beauty you have.
- OK, you maybe see me this way but it’s only your opinion.
- You still haven’t look at what things they write on the net about you? There are some photos they took of us when we were together, mainly at The Oscars and other photos by paparazzos and they have praised your beauty on the basis of these.
- But not a lot of people. And I still have been showed.
- If you appeared in a commercial too, surely more people praised you.
- You aren’t such a jealous man! – Heni laughed.
- I’m proud of I have a so beautiful wife like this and I want to show her to the world – then he kissed her.
- OK, I’ll do it for your sake but if it will take too long time to me to reach not to be so excited, I’ll employ an actor.

	Heni got the hang of practice at home with their film camera faster than she thought and she agreed to speak in the commercial. Laurence was right, sympathy was visible on Heni towards those girls who still were in that situation where Heni was a long time ago, because of Laurence, and the script was convincing too. The commercial was success.
- The nervous depression, feeling the despair and hopeless are in existence. More young girls suffer these than we would think. These can cause so much grief that many of them flee from it in the suicide. And I still haven’t even talked about that while this unrequited love lasts, how much this blocks these girls to found a family ever or even only experience mutual love. Some people suffer through a life by the person they love is almost surely never going to love them mutually and they can’t reach to personally see him either. These girls need psychiatrists’ and psychologists’ help what some of them can’t afford. And in that case if the treatment won’t work, let’s give them some hope; let’s give them a way out from suicide in order to can afford to at least travel there where they can be near them. An autograph already even can be a huge experience for them; they can feel better by this. It isn’t a question if they need our help too. The question is if we will help them.
- Offer 1 percent of your tax to those girls whose heart got lost to they can experience life’s positive side too – a middle-aged actor finished it.
	More people offered money soon. Laurence was proud of her wife made this commercial too so well like this. She deserved not to live only in the shadow of her husband. She kept saying in vain that she was happy already before because he and the children were there for her. And she really was happy but then she gave the chance for others too, to come out of that situation she also suffered when she was a teenager.

- Go now, you will be late! – Heni began to speak with laughing after a long, passionate kissing.
- We have time for each other at last and now I have to go away again. As an addition, not eve our common child is beginning to go to school today – Laurence answered.
- You were there at Langston’s and Montana’s first day too, in spite of fact that you were Gina’s husband. Delilah also deserves this.
- But we don’t know when I will get a new role and we will hardly see each other then again. I’m going to come back two hours later, then we will make up for this stayed-away time too.
- OK – Heni was smiling and they kissed each other again before Laurence left.
	Heni went into ht children’s room where she was happily enjoying in Loretta and in the little Laurence. The little Heni also came into her head. She had to take her to the nursery school soon. Two years later she also will be a pupil. It was incredible to her that when she will be twenty-five years old, she already will be a schoolgirl’s mom. Then her phone began ringing.
- Hallo? It’s Henrietta Fishburne.
- It’s Adam Black, from the Star magazine. Have you got some minutes for me? – Heni looked at the clock. She still had a half an hour till setting to the nursery school.
- Of course – what could he want? And how could he get her phone number?
- We picked up on the photos they’ve taken of you and we’ve got an idea about how could you popularize your foundation – and how were these two things connected with each other? – Heni was even more wondering.
- And how? – she asked surprised.
- We were considering of taking photos of you in swimsuit. That way men also will pick up on you and they may see to your foundation so more givers could be – Heni couldn’t even begin to speak through some seconds. As an addition, the man had to continue it – It fascinated people that how much soon you regained your shape after childbirth and people praise your beauty too.
- Really? – Heni laughed shyly. She couldn’t say anything more.
- So what do you say to that? Will you accept taking photos?
- Well, I don’t know… It came so suddenly.
- You would like me to call you back later?
- It’s not necessary. Ok. I’ll accept it.

23

	Laurence was just telling about how well Delilah was bearing up her first day at school, and then he realized how happy Heni was.
- I also missed something while I wasn’t at home?
- Imagine what happened! I was just thinking of two years later Heni already will go to school! It was so incredible to think of this and I was so happy about I will be so young when I will be a mom of a schoolgirl, and just like they would see through my thoughts, a guy called me who thought of me like a completely young girl! – she was smiling happily.
- And you’re happy about this? Didn’t he nag you? – the man was shocked.
- Certainly not! – she was laughing – He just offered me to taking photos of me in swimsuit to popularize the foundation in men’s circles too.
- And what did you say?
- I was completely surprised! – she was laughing again – I didn’t count on this. Only because some people like me and I’m a movie star’s wife? Surely because almost every world star’s can only have star wives.
- But what did you answer to the offer?
- Of course I said yes! – she was rejoicing about this – I didn’t count on I will have a chance for anything like this, being in my age! When I was a teen, I would like to be a model, but I was too small, fat and shy to this. Now I can experience something similar during taking photos!
- Is it surely a good idea? What this has to do with your foundation?
- I’ve already say this. I’m going to advertise this in other circles too. That man said that they’ll see to what kind of foundation I set up so they also can give.
- But these “other circles” won’t be something perverted swines, will they? And later they’ll ask you to yield consent to taking photos in lingerie and nude… - Laurence was afraid already in advance. He didn’t want to suffer this again what he has suffered because of Montana. He couldn’t lose also his wife. Even if Heni isn’t going to fall into depravity, maybe other men would want her and one of them could be succeed to get her…
- You know that I’m not going to accept anything like this!
- OK, I would like to be there at those taking photos. I won’t let them to try to take something vulgar photos of you.
 - In the end it will be easier if two of us will protest against this if they want something like this – Heni agreed.

	Because of Laurence’s presence, the photographer wasn’t trying to persuade her to take her bikini top off even only with back on the camera or drawing downer one side of the bikini bottom with one of her hands or to wear very little swimsuit. The photos were duly restrained; they showed only as much as it was necessary. And when they appeared, even more people began to give money to the foundation. Some middle-aged, mostly old women said she shouldn’t undress for a good cause. But in what does it differ from that people go to the beach? As an addition, her mother was calling her now! She was quite capable phoning her from Hungary to began scolding her like a child!
- Yes, Mom, I go to the Kingdom Hall.
- And do you preach a sermon too?
- No, Mom, I haven’t been christened yet.
- And why not?
- Mom, I have two babies and a kindergarten child! They take up a lot of time of me!
- In spite of this, you had enough time for that undressing.
- That didn’t take so much time. Besides, you don’t undress on beaches???
- Well…
- As an addition, I did it to help people. And because I could taste being a model at last …
- Well, OK, now, when I called you, let’s talking about anything else too. I’ve seen you on TV that Laurence got his first Oscar and the TV camera was showing you too. I was seeing that you were pretty much exciting and you looked like a teen girl in that little-girlish dress next to Laurence. You could choose a better dress too.
- I know, they’ve written this on the net and in a magazine too, I’ve talked this over with Laurence too, I don’ want you to talk about this!
- Well, it wasn’t a good impression at the first awards ceremony you took part in.
- Give me a break! You could see I was how much exciting without this thing too! I almost fainted!
- Well, OK, I can imagine this. And what way were you celebrating? Not in something depraved company, were you?
- Mom, you said we will be talking about something else?
- So you won’t even answer?
- No, everybody was pretty normal! Mom, Laurence is a middle-aged guy, he doesn’t take part in depraved teen parties!
- So that’s OK. I’ve seen on Facebook the little Henike how much has grew. It’s unbelievable that I already have a so big grandchild like this! – she was laughing – When will you come at last to show me Loretta and the little Laurence?
- Mom, Laurence is a world-famous movie star! He isn’t going to travel to Tatabánya with her wife to show his children to their grandparents!
- So come alone with the children! As an addition, I have seen Henike still personally only once! And you could sometimes call us; it’s very expensive for us to telephone to America from here!
- OK, I’ll call you back now.
- OK, but I’ll put you through to Dad.
- Ok. Bye.
- Bye! Look after yourself and the children! – they finished the conversation and Heni called her back how they agreed with each other on this.
- Hi.
- Hello! So didn’t Laurence tick off from your photos? – her father began to speak.
- Why would he ticked off? – Heni was who ticked off instead of him – Besides, he was also there to they don’t try to persuade me to do anything what I didn’t want to!
- Well, I thought that it couldn’t be gratilying him that already didn’t only her daughter undresses but also his wife…
- Don’t say „undress”! I only changed my clothes to bikini like I would be on a beach! – Heni was indignant.
- And also, you were posturing pretty much.
- Any photos isn’t vulgar at all!Or you think they’re vulgar?!
- OK, you’re right. And can you still control the children? – he was smiling.
- Now, when Laurence is at home again, it’s much easier – Heni talked to Tímea too and the little Heni also talked to her grandparents and to her aunt.

24

- Today I talked to my parents and to my sister – Heni said during going to sleep – It’s so queer to talk to them, we talk to each other so rarely and they take back my old life’s reminiscences.
- And is it positive or negative experience?
- My parents didn’t change at all. They’re as irritating and quarrelsome as they were.
- You surely got a lot of thing from them. And I don’t mean bad things. For ecample I have my mother thank for I reached there in my life. I still used to hate then that she constantly used to drag me to the acting courses but if she didn’t do it, we didn’t meet either.
- It’s so good that I alreay live with you! I love my parents too but you are who I love the most in the world an dtaht thing that I have talked to them again, remembered me of my old life when you still didn’t even know that I exist – she was stroking Laurence’s chelst – I have met them only two years ago last but I missed you so much through six years! – Heni embreaced her husband and she continued stroking the man’s chest and arms and Laurence was stroking his wife’s face and back durin these.

- I’ve considered about what you said – Heni bagan to speak next day, during having lunch.
- Why, what did I say? – Laurence asked.
- Nothing, just it came into my head how much proud I was of my daddy because of his two colege graduetes and I used to listen to his advice almost every time because he was so smart, he has given a relation every time, about everything what just croped up, he could talk so much about everything. But I have also my mother thought for the most because she acquainted me with this religion.
- What’s your religion?
- This is what I mean! I hardly deal with it. I also will forget this in the end! Now, when you’re also at home, and help me to lok after the children, I could pass the Bible exam at last and I could be christened in order to can preach a sermon!
- I thinik your mom said it to you.
- She only asked me if I preach a sermon and I said I still  haven’t have enough time to be christened because of the children but when I answered to my dad that I already had more time, it came into my head that I already could pass the exam.
- We don’t know how much time this period take when I’m at home. I can whenever get a new role in a movie and then you will be alone with the children again.
- But I will utilize this time, it will maybe enough, if not, I will try it at the next chance when you will be at home or I will ask Jenny for more help then usual to look after the children.

	Heni brushed her knowledge of Bible up and passed the exam. Laurence was in Africa as UNICEF ambassador just then, when her wife was christened. heni began to go to preach a sermon so she used Jenny’s babysitting more times and when she was at home, systematically teached the little Heni the Bible too. After Laurence came home, he got a role in a movie.
	When Laurence was already on filming, a man called Heni in his flat when she was preaching a shermon. This was the last location that day and her companion had another duty so he didn’t have time to go in. Heni was happy about they have found an inquirer at last. But what happened then, was rather scary.
- I was looking forward this moment since I saw you in that magazine! – the man said when he pushed her to the wall. Heni tryied to push him aside to get away – What happaned you bitch? You were so temting in that bikini yet – he tried to tear her clothes off and Heni shouted for help and overturned the table to him. An old neighbour, who was wearing blue-ish green dress, came into the flat and asked what happaned – The lady just got very frightened because I overturned the table to myself by chance – Heni couldn’t even begin to speak by the consternation. The neighbour left, Heni was trying to get away again but the man already holded her arms and feet on, he was caressing her breasts and kissing her neck and chest. Heni was shouting again, then another neighbour, a younger, blond man knocked on the door and came in. When the man let Heni go, she striked a vase to him, still before his very eyes, and ran away. She was running home with fuzzy make-up, then called Laurence because she wanted to hear his voice to calm her down and because she thought he would make a businiess from this if she told him only later what happened. The man left the filming and went home to Heni who already tidied her look and she was just trying forget the events in front of the TV.

25

- I’ve told you that you wouldn’t have to come home because of this. You can see that I’m alrady OK – but this wasn’t the usual happy welcome either while they didn’t meet for weeks. Only Heni’s glassy look was there instead of the happy welcome.
- It doesen’t seem to be ike that to me.
- It’s so good that you’re here! – she was running into her husbands arms and tears were flowing on her face again.
- Have you called the police department yet? – Laurence asked during stroking his wife’s hair and they were still embracing each other. Heni shaked her head – OK, I’ll call them – then the bell rang. Laurence answered the door, Heni was staying in the middle of the living-room. It was the police department. laurence didn’t understand this. Heni said she didn’t call the police.
- Good afternoon. I regret this is the situation when we have to meet a big star like this but we have to take your wife to the police station.
- Since when have you arrest those who was already raped?
- We don’t know what rape are you talking about. What we know, is that she alegedly caused a serious head injury to a certain man who reported her.
- I don’t believe it! I came home from a filming to be next to my wife who was frightened to death because they almost raped her! – Laurence shouted.
- Maybe it’s true but that man sustained a serious head injury when your wife defended herself from this. If you will report him, we can may arrest him too after he recovers. If he will recover at all – Heni was even more trembling and even more pale like a dead person by this. They marched her off and they seat her into the police car. They interrogated her in the police station and she told everything precisely that way how it happened – Do you want to report him?
- I wanted to help those unlucky girls by this taking photos! How can anybody abuse this?! Yes, I want that man if we can name man at all, to being put to prison! But I hope he won’t die because I couldn’t forgive even myself if I killed somebody! I went there exactly to save that man too! – she was sobbing.
It wasn’t even necessary to tel them what happened because the two stories were the same.
- We still can’t let you go til we’re interrogate the two neighbours, we can’t say anything more for the time being – they ran her into the cell and summoned the neighbours.

	Heni couldn’t believe that she was in a cell. Mainly that she maybe will a murderer soon. She never could absorb the fact that somebody died because of her. And also, she hadn’t even time to make him to turn over unbelieving. He will turn into an object because of her, a human will stop like he wouldn’t even be born. Forever. Without resurrection. She was constantly keeping asking questioning herself why didn’t she hit him less. But she couldn’t thinking in that moment. The only thing she knew was that she wanted fleeing. She never could imagine to be in any intimate connection with anybody, even voluntarily who wasn’t Laurence. Even is she was married, even if she wasn’t.

The neighbours arrived. They interrogated them one by one too. The old, blue-ish green dressed woman sat down to Heni’s place first.
- Is she who you saw with your neighbour? – they showed a photo of Heni to her.
- Yes, she is. I remember of her because I’ve seen her on TV too.
- And what did you see when you came into the flat?
- I saw my neighbour while he was climbing out of the table and he said he overturned it to himself by chance and this was why the girl shouted.
- Didn’t you hear the noise when the table overtuned?
- I did hear something, I think that was this.
- Was it before or after the shouting?
- I don’t know, I don’t remember.
- Overwork yourself please, this is very important!
- I think she shouted before it. I don’t think that nice girl would lie, mainly about that big that they almost raped her. And that young man…
- How do you know him?
- We haven’ met too much but I think he can be something sexaholic because women always have rambled through his door into and out of his flat.
- Thank you, you helped a lot with this.
Then it was the blond man’s turn.
- Is she that woman who saw at your neighbour?
- Yes, she is.
- Would you tell me what happened in that kitchen?
- It was pretty unambiguous. The guy was just trying to rape her and she knocked him down in order to can get away so she succeeded to run away.

	Laurence was startedly sitting in the living-room through lon thime after they took her away. Later he took measures in order to the world get to know also the reason of Heni attacked that man. As an addition, it wasn’t her who attacked him. She just defended herself. He informed the press about they would rape his wife if she didn’t knock him down with that vase and that the police department also surely will find it out and to don’t rumour anything else, till then neither.
	The little Laurence and Loretta began crying like they woulf feel the tension. Then Heni wasn’t there to look after them, although, Laurence also looked after them sometimes. He still felt this situation surreal that her wife was in custody. It came into his head that it was the time for them to having a bath and sleeping so he bathed and put them toi sleep but they were still crying and it took more time for them as usual to calm down and fall asleep. By his actor’s talent, he was trying not to showing before the children how much nervous he was. It seemed like it was efficient because the little Heni didn’t realize anything of this all thing when he took her home from the nursery school. The reason of Loretta and the little Laurence were so restless, was surely that the man couldn’t paying attention to them with one hundred percent, only Heni was on his mind, that they arrestd her while she was innocent.
	He called one of his friends and told him what happened to Heni. Ne needed someone ho he could talking to about this.
- Where is Mom? – the little Heni was coming out of her room when Laurence just finished the conversation.
- She’s not at home now – the man answered tensely. He just began calming down, then he had to face their child didn’t know and also couldn’t get to knoww what Heni got involved in.
- When is she going to come?
- Can’t I help you? – Laurence got out of the answer.
- I can’t reach my doll on my shelf.
- I’ll take it down – they were going into the children’s room – Here you are… - he was handing it to her with a forced smile.
- But who will I playing with if mother’s not at home?
- Would you like me to call Allie here?
- OK – Laurence went back to the living-room where he left his phone and called the parents of the little girl’s friend and they took Allie there a half an hour later.

Laurence payesd the bail off so Heni could go home for the time being.
- I think you already should go back to filming. Maybe they still can shoot your scenes subsequently too – Heni said after she calmed down a little bit.
- OK but I’ll go back only because I’m sure that it’s going to turn out that you’re innocent – the man was stroking Heni’s arm.
- I’ll miss you so much – she was embracing Laurence.
- Do you want me to stay? – he was stroking his wife’s hair.
- You’re going to arrive back to the hearing, aren’t you?
- I hope.

Next day he travelled back to filming. Although he was one of the co-stars in the movie, they shooted the other actor’s scenes on purpose till then, with leaving Laurence’s scenes out of the filming, maybe he will come back in time to get ready to the announced date. Heni preached a sermon in the future too but she didn’t dare to go into any stranger’s flat anymore, there were some of them who called her in to no avail. She wasn’t happy about these occassions anymore but it took place in her mentally then again what that man did to her and that she almost killed him. Although he already began recover and it was almost completely sure that he’s going to surivive his injury, it stayed to be sure that there is going to be a hearing, because of the grivous bodily harm. But she decided to that man won’t get away either with something cheap what he meaned to do to her. At least because Heni would be afraid of live that way that he could attack her whenever again.
	When he could leave the hospital, the police department didn’t interrogate him only as a plaintiff. But anybody haven’t know till when he will be at large. It was also possible that they won’t comprehend this court case as an attempted rabe but only as a simple sexual harassment. Or what would be even worse, that they will believe that she was who attacked him. In the end there was only one witness the man tried to rape her.
	She called Laurence.
- Your voice is such an alarmed. There’s something problem?
- They let him out of the hospital, and he can whenever attack me. I’m afaraid so much!
- He surely will get benind bars. Everybody knows it was just self-deence.
- And what will be till then?
- If it calms you down, I’ll engade some bodyguards to the house.
- There’s something too.
- What?
- I’m expectant.
- What? – the man was shocked.
- Not from that man, I’ve said he didn’t succeed to reach a stage when he would rape me.
- But why did you tell me only now?
- I believed til now that it’s signs was just by being nervous but I already know this.
- And what will we do with one more child? We already hardly can manage to look after these three children. As an addition, it will be already the seventh to me. Or are you happy about this now?
- Our children are one of the most wonderful things what has happened to me in my life. But this is already really much. Jenny can’t bring them up instead of us.
- So what will be now?
- I don’t know. I not have an idea. What to do now? I not have the heart to offer it for adoption in order to it grow up at other people.
- There is another solution too.
- Don’t even say this! I felt so much relief when I got to know that man survived that head injury I caused to him. I couldn’t live with knowing I killed somebody. Mainly our child! And also, my religion forbids it.
- I have been afread already in advence of you will force your religion down my throat. I even found it strange that oyu didn’t do it till now.
- While you can say anything, I won’t have an abortion! If you won’t bring me by force to the doctor and pay them off to hold me down, I will keep this child!
- But how do you want to bring it up with the other three ones? And how can I have enough time to look after everybody of my seven children???
- I don’t know. Later it already won’t be necessary to look after them so much. As an addition, Lantsgon and Montana are already adults. And your better not to even consider her your daughter…
- Thank you about you remembered me this too! – the man shouted.
- What???
- That how much problem can be with a child.
- What do you think, how much chance is there to my religious educating will let this???
- You’re just hinting at I badly educated Montana?!
- No! But I’m going to be less pliant with the children in some things! – his wife was already shouting too.
- Now I have to go back to filming. We’ll talk to each other later more. Bye.
- Bye… - they finished the conversation.

	The bodyguards has arrived. But Heni and Laurence couldn’t agree with each other on undertaking the child, they’ve talked the subject over more times in vain. She sometimes hasn’t got vigour to look after the already existing Heni and the little ones in this mood, sometimes she found comfort in looking after them, in she could spend her time with thw who she loved so much and they made her forget her problems even if for a little time but the children saw the tension on her every occasions so they felt good only with Jenny nowadays so mainly she looked after them.
When Laurence arrived in home, heni was sobbing on the living room’s foa. She hasn’t even noticed that the man arrived.
- What happened? – Laurence was surprised.
- The hearing is going to be soon, as an addition, I’m expecting a baby won’t have father practically – his wife began to speak. Her voice was mechanical.
- We’ve talked it over already more times. I think you have something else problem now – the man said rudely and set to the children’s room to greet the children but Heni’s hysteric shout stopped him.
- You’re right! – she was sobbing.
- So what?
- I can frequent to all sorts of people’s falt to save them, also these swnies like that man! But what about you?!
- What do you mean??? And what saving are you talking about???
- This is what I mean, you don’t even know what I’m talking about! In spite of fact that we sometimes discuss, I love you and It’s hard to live with being conscious that on one day I will lose you.
- I will get old sooner than you. So what?
- This shows that you don’t even know anything about this all thing! I endured it somehow till now but when you saw that thing on phone, it rudely awakened to that this can’t stay this way. Now I would say more in vain, you would think I’m complete stupid because you haven’t knew this religion. While it’s so reasonable.
- I really don’t understand what you are talking about.
- We’d better to revert to this subject when this court case and this children’s pledge will be solved… - Laurence went to the children, he was talking to the little Heni, feeded the little ones and put them to bed, and Heni was watching TV display, she didn’t even comprehend what was on TV, even if she was trying to concentrate on this so much.

	In the law courts, Heni faced again that she was a potential criminal. That she was a defendant. She was who almost killed a man while she met him only to save him. What will be with the chld if she will get to penitentiary and it won’t can count on even its mother??? Jenny will be who mainly will bring the others up?! She felt giddly then everyting went black.
	She found herself in the hospital, with flat belly. Some days ago she has  noticed that the baby was visible from outside too. And now it wasn’t. When they realized that she regained consciousness, they called Laurence in who sat down next to her bed.
- You lost very much blood. But you will recover soon – he was stroking her face and hair.
- Are you happy about this now? Or did you maybe utilized that I fainted and took me in to abortion?! – Heni began to speak while her tears were flowing.
- If you choosed that, you were completely well now.
- So it’s my fault?! That I didn’t kill our child?!
- Now don’t deal with this. You have to recover before it.
- I’m sorry. It’s not your fault. Just this all thing is so much now to me!
- I know. This is much also to me. But I know it’s not your fault either that you became expectant. I mean it’s only as much your fault as much mine. We’re going to more take care of this not to happen again.
- You wouldn’T even love this child? I mean at least after it was born.
- I surely would love it. The problem would be excatly that I wouldn’T have enough time for my every children.
- And who will have enough time for them if I’ll get into prison?
- You certainly won’t get into prison – then the man noticed that Heni fainted again during the sentence. Or did she only fel asleep? But during talking??? He called the doctors who sended him out of the ward and he didn’t know what they were doing to Heni while he had to be waiting outside.
	Later, when it came into his head, he took measures not to they let the press into the hospital. At least it occupied his attention somehow or other instead of idler waiting.

- Her heart stopped for a little bit of time because of the much loss of blood but we did revive her. She is surely going to can manage stay alive for some hours, then this may repeat more times – one of the doctors said after he came out.
- Why don’t you give normal blood to her at last instead of this damned supplementary blood?! You don’T see this doesen’t work?!
- But this also hepls a lot.
- It’s more important for you wich cure is to the patient’s liking than she will stay alive or not?! – Laurence shouted when the other doctors already also have came out.
- I regret this but we have to obey the patient’s wish.
When Laurence went into the ward again, Heni was as white as a sheet, her body seemed to be even smaller and fragiler than usual between the even more machines what were connected to her.
	He sat back next to her bed and took her hand.
- Hi.
- Hi. But we’ve met not long ago, haven’t we?
- Not too long ago. But you were somewhere else through a little time.
- I was here till the end. I know you’re fed up with my religion but I said it in religious meaning too – she was smiling.
- If you’re going to continue it this way, there really won’T be anybody to bring the children up with me.
- So you don’t understand? God knows everything much more than people so He understands medical science too more than people do! You think he said us not to use blood because he wants to kill us?
- Well, it really seemed to be like this not long ago to me…
- Even if the present medical science hasn’t can use supplementary blood, still this is what saves my life if I don’t accept blood! This present life can be over if we throw it away because of the lows but we have to do it in exchange for the eternal life after the end of the world.
- I hadn’t got any problem with your religion through five years but it seems like this already has driven you completely mad.
- I’ve said it’s going to sound queer for the time being. The problem is you haven’t knew anything yet.
- I have endured somehow that we haven’t observe almost any holiday but I refuse if you will leave me here with the kids.
- I know. You wouldn’t have enough time for them…
- Do oyu remember when I was in hospital and I said you would be who I would miss the most of the whole world? You think I could live without you? – he was stroking his wife’s face and hair and kissed her.
- I couldn’t live without you either. If you knew how much bigger danger you are in than me…

	Laurence fleed into memorizing the scripts and going to rehearsals from that thing that Heni lied in hospital in grave condition. Sometimes he tried to take his attention up with the children and he tryied to find some happines in spending his time with them but they didn’t bring his high spirits for long time. They had to revive Heni two more times, at one occasion it took a long time while her heart wasn’t beating but she didn’t get any lasting damage. She recovered fast but while they haven’t let her home, Laurence called Jenny Jenny to look after the children oftener than usual because he didn’t have enough time to this without Heni.
	Heni sooner recovered than they believed, even if not somuch sooner than Laurence then. They let her out of the hospital soon. The man was happy about he could be with her more than before and about she was already well but he was afraid in advance of she was already really going to be convincing him about her religion. He had not got enough time, he didn’t feel like dealing with this eather. They would just discussing again.
	It seemed like Laurence was mistaken. Heni speded a lot of time with her children, and mostly with him, to make up for the time she spended in hospital and it seemed like everybody was a member of a happy family. Heni was happy about she could be with them again and she would like to have her swing every minute he spended with Laurence till the rest of time. Sometimes it came into her head that if she won’t do anything, she will lose the man but she succeeded to divert her thoughts from this every occasion. The kids were already older and also, Heni took after them more than it was necessary because she liked to be with them so much and because she didn’t want to take chances. Then, when they needed already less time, she disctracted her thoughts by she went to shopping to the mall every weekends with Jenny and her friends who Heni also became friends with. The paparazzos found her. They already followed her to since she had been that movie star-wife who they accused of grievous bodily harm what she commited allegedly by self-devence because they wanted to rape her. They took some photos of them while she were walking in the mall with the teenage girls and she didn’t seem to be much older than them either. There wouldn’t be any problem that way but this way that she was the wife of the fifty-three-year-old Laurence, amy people thank she already shouldn’t conduct herself like a teen girl, being twenty-four years old. This remarks were the last drops that made the cup run over to Heni.
 	Some days later Laurence noticed that his wife was reflecting with glassy look during sitting on the sofa.
- Why did you reflected so much? – Heni’s tears came out of her eyes by the question.
- I did try to keep it in myself because I didn’t want to nag you with this. I also know we would only discussing if I negged you with my religion again – she answered and the man sat down next to her.
- You still didn’t ignore that I’m not as religious as you? – he was surprised.
- You can’t even imagine how it feels like when it comes to my mind that I will have to live without you.
- Did you get into this mood before too and you kept it in yourself only for my sake? – he took Heni’s hand and he dried Heni’s tears with his other hand.
- It sometimes came into my head but I succeeded to ignore this woon, till now.
- If it’s so important for you like this, I’ll try to understand your religion – he embraced Heni.
- Really? – Heni laughed by joy through her tears.
- Although, I still hardly believe that my wife is a Jehova’s witness – Laurence was laughing too.
- While you’re a world-famous movie star! – Heni was laughing again but already cheerfully – You were who reminded me that I also got something from my mother – she turned serious again – This is why I began more deal with this religion. But you got this fame from yours. You began that conversation exactly with this then… If you also have to give up a lot of things. I mean you give up by yourself if it will be important for you. I feel like I have to call your attention about if you really want this religion-thing, you are going to have to rejuse many casts in movies – she was sadly holding Laurence’s hand – You may have to refuse every casts… I regret this so much…
- You don’t have to regret this. I would stop it excatly at the height. I won the Oscar exactly last year… It would be much harer to oyu to live forever that way like you lived in the past weeks than me to stop it. And I’ve already thanked my Mom for the things she did for my career in my childhood. And always you have been who had to look after the children when I’m on filming. Only you and the babysitter have bringed them up then.
- But you’re still gaoing to have some duty if you’ll adopt this religion. Although, this is going to be much less than a filming lasts.
- For the time being, I don’T know what will be about me in connection with religion. It remains to be seen if how much tis all thing will be convincig to me.
- I know. But it’s so good that already there are some hope!

	At the heraing, it was still disturbing Heni that they were considering her a defendant there but she was already much more bearing this than for the first time because already everything else was back to normal in her life. Laurence was completely sure of Heni was going to be innocent so he let the press in the hall too. But Heni was very exciting also because of this. The man embraced and was trying to calm her down before the hearing.
- Everything is going to be OK. Be clever! I love you – they kissed each other and went int othe courtroom.
They interrogated the defendant’s and the paintiff’s some close relatives too because of the few witnesses, in order to tell what like people they know them. In the end, it was necessary to be proved that man attacked her and she just defended herself from him.
	They couldn’t say too many good things about the plaintiff so it was conceivable that he has tried to rape somebody. During the years, Heni’s parents and Eliza completely learned English in order to can talk sometimes to Heni’s husband so they could interrogate them too. Heni and the witnesses told the same what they told at the police station and the plaintiff said the same what he said to the neighbour.
- True enough that Heni always has have such a difficult personality – her father siad – But in the end, this haven’t appeared in aggression. The things she was different than others was that she used to be such a shrinker person, she used to talk to people only a few words and that she used to invent various rules for herself and she always used to obey these. At least she used to be like this when she still used to live with us. Nowadays we haven’t met and talked to each other too many times. But I think important to tell that she never hasn’t could kill any kind of living being under no circumstances, she has rarely saied that she couldn’t deprive even an insect of its life. Anad also, she has been afraid of watching scary, bloody horror movies.
- Haven’t you experience any suspicious thing whenever when you have talked to each other or met nowadays?
- According to these few conversations, it has seemed to me that she hasn’t change too much. But I know from TV and news that she became a mature adult according to more point of views than that girlish personality she used to be when shie lived with us.
- According to what point of views?
- I can’t really tell it now but evidently some mature is necessary to bring the children up at home when her husband is on filming. But she didn’t change according to that point of view that she still is not a violent person. As an addition, when she still used to live with us, she was many times really big discussions between us but I realzed she became a bit more amicable till then.
	Then it was her mother’s turn.
- Henike, my daughter has suffered a lot of torments in her life and she has reached huge achievements compared to these, instead of she would expert her anger towards her destiny to people.
- Isn’t it possible that she experted her anger with this attack?
- This doesn’t any sense to do it years later when she already hasn’t those big problems like she used to have in her teenager age. She already surely got over these during the years. And also, we, Jehova’s Witnesses don’t let anybody to rank among us who is susceptible to violence or even suspicious to be a thing like this.
- Are you completely sure of Heni attecked by self-defence?
- Yes. I’m completely sure of this.
- Thank you.
	It was Eliza’s turn.
- My sister used to shout to my parents many times like a raving lunatic and she used to talk to them disresrectfully when we were teenagers but I used to have to try to persuade already then very hard to hit my dog when it did something bad.
- Hasn’t she hurt anybody assaultly?
- I don’t know if anything happened like this.
- Could you tell me what liki she is now?
- We don’t meet to often and we really rarely talk to each other on telephone too but I haven’t experienced even any oral roughness either in these few occasions.
- Your parents or other else has told you she talked to very rudely to somebody neither or even threatened somebody with anything?
- No, anyone hasn’t.
	It was Laurence’s turn.
- Heni is the mot wonderful creature I’ve met in the last soime decades or ever. Her lovely aurashows in her innocence and in her morality too and I can’t even imagine about her to hurt anyone. Minly that way that she hasn’t the cause of doing this either. What could be her motive?
- Mr. Fishburne, let me reminding you that the paintiff reported your wife! This is enough to bring her to court.
- I’m protesting this! Motive is really an important part of occusation – their lawyer began to speak. The judge accpted this.
- As an addition, the plaintiff recovered from his injuries but he caused a serious mental injury to my wife and the attack was self-defence because if she didn’t do it, even more trouble happened to Heni.
- What do you think, what is the more serious injury: convalesing near to death by dealing him a blow or if someone is almost raped? Provided that the attemted rape did happened at all  - Heni turned her head away with tighting her lips and casting her eyes because it was so much worrying her, he was feeling it so humiliating that they were talking about this again.
- Present is much more important than past. The plaintiff is already well. But my wife still doesn’t even want to talk about the events – he looked at Heni – And look at her how much worried mood she is in by we mentioned this at all!
- Maybe she’s rather afraid about it will come out that the griveious bodily harm had no kind of prior event like this.
- So what do you explain the eyewitnesses’ evidence? – their loxyer began to speak again.
- I understand as far as your peciniary opportiunities are very good. Wha tif Mrs. Fishburne offered a lot of money to the eyewitnesses in order to confess against the plaintiff?
- I’m protesting this! You’re querying the judicial oath’s importance with this – their lawyer said. The judge reject4ed this by there have been some example to false evidence and they were naturally going to pnish this if this will come out at this time too.
- As an addition, this rape-court case is another court case. Don’t let forget that now and here Mrs. Fishburne is the defendant! – Heni smoothed her hair back, had a sigh and lowered her head by hearing the expression – By the way what do you say to the article published in news where Mr. Fishburne’s daughter who was born by his first marriage, made that statement that Mrs. Fishburne seriously endangered her health when she almost slammed the glass door to her in the living-room?
- I’m sure of it didn’t even coma into my wife’s mind that she could cause any demage to my daughter. As an addition, didn’t even happen anything. The door and she got away unharmed too. At least an accident could be by this.
- But your wife commited it by second-degree. And also, it couldn’t cause any kind of “accident’. Montana Fishburne could even bleed to death with big possibility if that glass door banged into her.
- Heni didn’t commited anything and any trouble didn’t happen to Montana.
- I have knowledge of Miss Fishburne didn’t intend this statement for a charge. I’m quating: “The only thing what could prove Heni’s possible violence is that one day when she slammed the door on me, that glass door in their living-room almost hit against me”.
- But this still happened and there even could be by this a murder through negligence or a second-degree grivous bodily harm. And this proves the defendant’s aggressive inclination.
- This one event? As an addition, didn’t happen anything and my daughter was defending my wife with this – Laurence said. They had a break at court before announcing the sentence.

- I’m so afraid! – Heni said after they left the courtroom. She was trembling and her tears were flowing.
- Calm down, it already will come to an end soon – Laurence was embracing her. They were embracing each other long time, than Heni’s family went to them.
- I didn’t count on they will can assert so much like this how violent I am. The only thing I remember of my violence that we used to quarrel with my sister when we were little girls!
- I didn’t think either they will be so bese like this but I think it will be come out that you’re right – Laurence said.
- Yes, it really seems to be that they’re going to admit that you’re right – Heni’s father began to speak – But I think you already suspect that it wasn’t so good idea to accept taking photos of you in swimsuit.
- I don’t believe it! You really think this all thing is my fault?! You defend that swine who wanted to rape me?! – his daughter was indignant.
- Jakab, don’t talk it over now! Can’t you see what like mood Henike is in without thiw too? – her mother began to speak.
- That’s all?! That don’t talk it over now?! You also think me something bitch?! – Heni ticked off even more.
- I also worried when she accepted it because I was afraid of this all thing will be similar what Montana has done. But the photos are tasteful and comparatively restrained, as an addition, Heni acccepted it for a good cause, to help other people – Laurence guarded her.
- I think you only shouldn’t hit so big when you got away – Eliza began to speak.
- I know, I’ve ghought it over a lot of times but I had to act without thinking in that moment and the only thing what was on my mind then that I wanted to can get away – Heni answered. then they called them back into the courtroom.
	Heni felt like she were will faint when she went back to her place and was waiting for the sentence. The introduction lmade her even more tense. She aldready wanted to be over of it. Later she was already hoping she will have a bit more time to get ready for the worst thing. She clinged to her chair and she was spontanously looking at the judge with begging look, she knew in vain she already couldn’t do anything. But it wasn’t even necessary. Justice won. She was innocent.
	When Heni heard the word, she was feeling something of the kind after huge relief when she got to know she got her training trade school report, later her high school diploma, just the feeling was even much more powerful now than then.
- I told they’ll acquit you – Laurence was smiling at Heni when they arrived out of the courtroom. They were hurrying to reach their car before the press will begin quiestioning Heni and her famous husband.

- I don’t know how would I endure to be through years in prison, between criminals – Heni said after they’ve arrived in home.
- I would terribly miss you – Laurence answered and kissed his wife.
- And would you wait for me? 
- You wouldn’t deserve to replace you only because you got to prison while you’re innocent. And I still wouldn’t want anybody else, only you – he wass stroking Heni’s face and hair and kissed her again.
	Later Heni’s parents and Eliza came round to their place and they solved their disagreements too, they were taking photos with them about each other, then talking in the living-room together. They knew they weren’t going to meet through long time, but everything was OK about them, and they were going to keep connection on the internet and telephone.
- We don’t meet much oftener your family either than mine – Heni said.
- That’s right. I haven’t had too much time nowadays because of the filmings and getting ready for these.
- I wouldn’t think Montana will defend me after I slammed a door on her and I wasn’t too kind either to her when she came into the hospital to you after that shot.
- She surely did it to make it up with us. Or she maybe mentioned tha tevent to use that information against you.
- She already was conducting herself such kindly to me when she took Loretta back.
- Maybe we should give her one more chance.
- Maybe.
- But get ready for she hasn’t so innocent personality like you have. Because of her occupation, and because she really has aggressive inclinations, maybe I can’t even make it up with her either, only for a short time, if it will came up that she really wanted to defend you with that statement in the news.
- Everybody could know at court that we can’t be on too good terms with her after she brought shame to the family and her guy kidnapped Loretta. What do you think, did she help my acquittal if they interpreted she still told in spite of this that she didn’t think me aggressive?
- I don’t know. But your goodwill and innocent, little-girlish face I love so much in you, maybe helped – he kissed Heni and they were kissing through a long time. They were embracing each other right during it in orter to anybody and anything part them.
