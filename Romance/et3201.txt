I glared at Rock as we passed close by each other on the dance floor. Nadia Nargent's lip curled in a smile while she swayed in my fiance's arms.

"I think I'm about done," I said.

When will this song ever be over?

I wanted to escape.

"I thought we might have another dance when this one's over." He bit his lip, staring into my eyes.

"Maybe. I need some air first."

A jolt went through me all of a sudden, setting my cl*t abuzz. It lasted for a full ten, maddening seconds. I sucked in a sharp breath, grabbing John's shoulders tightly.

"Whoa. You okay?" He held me steady, and we stopped swaying for a moment.

I could only nod, my knees weak.

Damn Rock and his remote control. The vibrating panties were such a bad idea. He had some nerve.

I shot daggers at Rock, even as desire grew in the pit of my stomach. He raised an eyebrow in my direction, making my blood boil.

"Maybe you do need some air. I'll go with you."

"No. I'm fine. I'll be back." I let go of John and made a beeline out the door of the gorgeous hotel ballroom.

Anywhere but with him. Not now.

"Lacey, what are you doing?" Rock grabbed my arm from behind just as I pushed the elevator button.

"Getting some air. Getting away from you." I choked the words out as he got into the elevator behind me. We were alone.

"I need you to play your part, to do what I'm paying you for." Rock let go of my arm and pressed me against the elevator wall.

I enjoyed the contact with his body, but the image of him and Nadia dancing made me shake my head.

"Oh, the part you were playing so well?" I raised an eyebrow at him, hating the shaking in my voice.

"What's that supposed to mean?" His breath came warm against my face, sending chills through me.

"The way you were dancing with Nadia." I tried to ignore his hands slipping around my waist.

"Lacey, it's part of the act. I'm a billionaire and a CEO. People expect me to dance with gorgeous women."

I laughed. "Right, like your fiancee maybe?"

He grinned. "Yes, you, too."

"It's all fake anyway, so I don't know why I care, but it's like this." I bit my lip. "If I'm going to act a part, then you'd damned sure better do the same. I'm already being made a fool by you." I wanted to cry.

"Lacey, you're so important to me." Rock's words were a caress, and he gathered my body closer to his.

The hard outline of his c**k pressed against my stomach as he hiked up my dress.

"What are you doing?" I asked, my mouth dropping open.

"Stopping this elevator. They have ten others. We only need a few minutes." Rock winked at me as he thrust his hand inside my panties.

"You can't be serious." I groaned, closing my eyes as he found my cl*t and stroked it in slow circles.

"Oh, I'm totally serious." He punched a button, and the elevator stopped its ascent.

"What if-"

"What if nothing, Lacey. I could buy this whole hotel if I wanted. I couldn't care less if some manager finds us in the elevator together. Money means I don't have to worry about that, and neither do you, now that you're my bride-to-be."

I heard the mocking note in his voice, but my arousal was so strong, I didn't care. He slipped two fingers inside me, even as his thumb flicked against my clit.

"Rock."

"Let me do this. Then we'll go back to the party, and I swear I'll behave like a good little boy. I won't give anybody anything to talk about-except for how wild I am about my gorgeous fiancee." He growled and caught my bottom lip in his even as he drove me to ecstasy with his fingers.

I trembled against him. He wrapped my hair around his free hand. He never broke the gaze between us, and the connection was so erotic that it brought tears to my eyes as I reached my release with a shout.

"Lacey, please don't doubt me." He leaned in closer, took me into his arms, and kissed me. His mouth demanded everything from me, and I could hardly breathe with the intensity of his lips against mine. I tasted blood on my bottom lip when he finally pulled away, and pinprick stars danced in my vision. I collapsed against him.

Rock held me up, saying nothing for a moment.

"Ready?"

"Yeah." I moved a step away from him as he punched the elevator back into motion.

* * * *

The rest of the party was a whirlwind of congratulations and dances with board members. True to his word, Rock steered clear of Nadia Nargent. Her disdain for me was written on the sneer she kept on her lips the whole night.

Oh, well. She'll get over it.

I decided to enjoy my time in the limelight as Rock's cherished future bride. After all, it could all be over in a matter of months...or days, year contract or not.

"So, when's the date?" Walter Marsh asked, a half scowl on his face.

Rock had sauntered off to try to get me a plate of food. That was, if he could get through the crowd clamoring to speak with him.

I shot a glance in his direction.

Hurry up, Rock.

"Honestly? I'm not sure."

Embarrassment washed over me. How could I not know that important detail?

"Humph. Hopefully, it's next year. There's a lot going on at Regal right now. A bunch on Rock's plate."

I could have sworn the man had a malicious note to his voice.

"Well, we have to talk about it. I'm sure Rock will pick an appropriate date."

Rock appeared at my elbow, and I breathed a sigh of relief.

"Walter, I hope you've enjoyed the party."

"I have, Rock. Lovely woman you've got here." Walter shot a stiff smile in my direction.

"I know. I'm lucky."

"Well, I'm going to call it an early night."

"I'll be in touch."

Rock watched him walk away.

"What did he ask you? I'm sorry you got left alone with him."

I shrugged. "Well, you wanted me to mingle, so I did and I will." I grinned at him, thinking of his fingers inside my panties and our elevator time.

"Good."

"But...he did ask me something I couldn't answer. It was awkward."

Rock steered me toward a table off by itself. "Tell me. Even if you think it wasn't important."

I sat after he pulled out my chair. "Oh, I think it's important, Rock." My voice was laced with steel. The more I thought about not knowing the answer to Walter Marsh's question, the more embarrassing it was.

"Okay. Don't keep me in suspense." He frowned at me.

I enjoyed the moment, knowing that Rock hated to be denied his right to know everything.

"Well, Walter asked when the big day is. In other words, when are we tying the knot?" I raised an eyebrow, playing with the straw of the cocktail in front of me.

"Oh."

For the first time since I'd met him, Rock looked stumped.

I giggled. "Wow. So, you really have no idea."

"No, I do. I was just thinking soonish. Very soon, but I hadn't put an actual date on it yet." He stared into my eyes as if there was hidden wisdom there.

I admired the way his dark hair was mussed, his top button of his white shirt undone. I wanted to take him to bed at that moment-hang everything else.

"Um, just a minor point. This is a sham engagement, right?"

Rock bit his lip. "Yeah."

He sounded as if there were more he meant to say but didn't.

"Okay. So, we wait and see what happens, I think."

But that's not what I wanted. I wanted him to sweep me into his arms and say we're getting married in two days.

"I have a better idea." His eyes glittered like onyx.

My skin prickled.

"Let's get married next week or at least make it widely known that that's our plan and that we're going to fly back to California right before. I'll have the necessary papers drawn up, of course." Rock avoided my gaze as he twiddled with his napkin.

"Papers?" I wasn't going to make this easy on him.

"Yeah. As in that this...isn't real. It will be for show if it does go through. We'll quietly dissolve it once everything blows over and I find out what I want to know."

"Right." My voice was brittle. I swallowed back tears.

What a fool I am.

"In fact, I'm going to announce that right now. Come with me." He took my arm, a current tingling between us.

Rock led me out on the dance floor. He had a word with the band that was playing, and the music ground to a halt as he stepped back to my side, sliding his arm around me.

That was a good thing because my legs were shaking.

"I have another announcement to make. Some of you might have noticed that I was so enraptured with my beloved that I didn't slip a ring on her finger." Rock grinned, and everyone laughed softly.

Blood pounded in my ears.

What is he saying?

I hadn't even thought of a ring. I realized he hadn't either, or at least he had forgotten whatever he'd brought for me to wear.

Because this is a sham...

My face grew hot.

"So, I want to do this again."

Rock knelt on one knee, holding my hand in his as he slipped a box out of his pocket. "Lacey Pate, will you marry me a week from now in California? And will you wear my ring?"

I nodded, unable to speak as he slipped a glittering platinum band on my finger. The diamond was so large, I had no idea what size it was.

"Well?" He winked at me.

"Yes, of course. Yes."

Rock stood and kissed me then, his arms going around me. There was nothing fake about the way his lips claimed mine.

"Huzzah!" someone shouted, and everyone clapped.

"Not the smoothest engagement twice over in the world, but it will do, I think. You'll all receive invitations here in Venice, but the wedding will be back in California a week from tonight."

I gasped for breath as the room seemed to close in on me.

"Are you all right?" Rock murmured in my ear, sending chills through me.

"Yes."

"You look...I don't know. Shocked." He smiled, lifting my chin as he gazed into my eyes.

"That ring..." I trailed off, not knowing what to say.

"What man would screw up and not give a ring to the woman he'd asked to marry him?" Rock whispered the words in my ear as he led me into a slow dance, every inch of his body pressed to mine.

"I don't know."

"Well, it certainly makes it look real. Doesn't it? Does the ring fit?" He lifted my hand to his lips, kissing it and admiring the gems sparkling under the lights of the ballroom.

"I think so." My hand was shaking. I couldn't get over the dazzle factor of this thing.

"Good. I didn't see how your finger was bigger than a size five." He stroked my hand, and I closed my eyes, a wave of desire rushing through me. "Now, back to our public."

"Thank you all for being here and sharing our joy. Goodnight and party on...at least till four o'clock when the band leaves." Rock laughed, and everyone cheered as they floated back onto the dance floor, surrounding us.

"I want to go. I've had enough." I pressed against him.

"Me too. And we will. Very soon."

I kissed him lightly on the lips, reveling in the illusion my life had become. "I hate to say it, but I have to pee really badly."

He laughed. "Go then. Come right back. We have another hour and we can be out of here, I'd say...earlier than everyone else. But I think they'll understand." Rock winked, and I let his hands go with some reluctance.

I strode out of the ballroom again, this time not at the frantic pace with which I'd fled earlier.

I wonder if Rock's plan is going to work, and if so, what does that mean?

My stomach twisted with anxiety.

The hallway looked empty, and I had to hunt for the restroom for a moment. It was tucked away down a side corridor.

Right before I reached it, a hand clamped over my mouth, and a vise-like grip held me fast. "Don't say a word. Just heed my warning."

The voice was distorted by a machine or something. I twisted in the strong grip of a man-who I couldn't have said.

"Yes, it's Lucifer."

I gasped behind his hand and groaned.

"Break the engagement off if you want Rock Weldon to live. Do it tonight. You have until 5:00 a.m. Your hotel room is bugged. If I see you there with Rock past that time, he's a dead man, bodyguard be damned."

My eyes filled with tears.

"Now, go in the bathroom and don't look back. And don't you dare trifle with me, Lacey. I will kill the man you love without another thought. I despise him and everything he stands for, and I will have what I deserve. But it's your choice. He can die now or live. I don't have to kill him to get what I want, but I will. Heed my warning." He grunted in my ear. "Now walk." He shoved me from behind, and I ran into the bathroom door, gasping for breath as I yanked it open, not daring to look back.

I knew Lucifer wasn't joking, and I would do what I had to do to keep Rock Weldon safe, even if it meant breaking a contract and losing him. He'd almost died a few days ago. I wouldn't chance that again. Surely he would be safe if I got out of his life.

I leaned against the bathroom wall, tears filling my eyes as I glanced at my watch. 1:10 a.m. Only a few more hours.

"How am I going to do this?" I whispered in the deserted room.

Then I knew. I finished my business in the restroom, my pulse thrumming in my head.

* * * *

"Can we go already?" I ran my hand down the front of Rock's white shirt, and he groaned.

"You know what? Yeah. We can. Let's blow this joint." He spoke to a couple people on the way out, clutching my hand all the while. "I can't wait to get you in the Emperor's Suite, all to myself," he growled as we walked out of the wide double doors.

2:01 a.m.

I bit my lips, my nerves frazzled.

The plan was to seduce Rock, to give him all I had so he would fall asleep. Shouldn't be too tough. Once he did, I'd sneak out of the hotel room, get back to the villa, grab my passport and a few of my things, and leave. I wouldn't head home immediately. I'd go where he couldn't find me-to a close cousin's house in Georgia. She'd been begging me for some time to come see her. Rock had given me cash, and I had credit cards, so I could make it there.

Rock led me to the elevator, a determined look on his face. "I've been thinking about tasting you all night."

I moaned as he pushed me against the wall before the doors even closed. He punched twenty on the elevator, and we zoomed up. His hands were all over me, and I grew dizzy with arousal when he nipped at my ear.

When the elevator stopped, he scooped me up into his arms as I squealed.

"My lady, your suite awaits." He squeezed me as he fumbled for the key card to the room. I giggled.

"This blasted thing. I have it now." He got the green light and carried me over the threshold.

I noticed our suitcases in the room and roses strewn all over the bed.

Rock put me down. "Undress and I'll meet you in the tub in a moment. It should be ready."

I closed my eyes at the thought, my pu**y clenching. I wasn't going to waste any time seducing him. 2:07 a.m.

He strode toward a small table laden with champagne and food. I found the catch on my dress and shimmied out of it. Then I walked up behind him and slid my arms around his waist, letting my hands drift down to his cock-hard as I'd known it would be.

"It's my turn first," I whispered, lowering my voice on purpose.

I undid his pants with a smooth move, and they fell to the floor as he moaned.

"Lacey..."

"Shh. Let me. I've been thinking about your c**k all night, wanting to suck you dry, Rock Weldon...among other things."

He sighed.

I wondered how many times I could make him come before he'd be spent. If I was lucky, I could do this right and save his life.

I worked his silky boxer briefs down over his ass partway. He stepped out of his shoes, his breath coming in gasps. I knelt down, placing my tongue against the cleft of his ass. I licked up and down the crevice several times.

"Lacey, what are you doing?" His teeth were clenched.

"Exploring," I said playfully as I ran my hands over his tight cheeks, my tongue still at work. I spied a container of some sort of oil on the table. "Umm. I'm going to need this." I grabbed it and shook some into my hand. I smoothed the oil into the crevice, my own breath coming faster. I was so wet and throbbing myself that I could hardly stand it.

I reached around his muscled hip, my hand oiled up as I stroked his sac first then up his rigid, thick cock. I lubed him up good as he groaned.

"God, I want you. I'm going to burst."

"You'll have to wait." I laughed softly while I danced my other hand down his cleft again, finding his opening. I slowly pushed one well lubed finger inside his ass, taking my time and wiggling it as I did so.

"Holy shit." He sucked in a breath. I pushed the finger all the way in, stroking his c**k up and down with my other hand.

"You like it like that?" I bit my lip, knowing he did.

"With you? Of course. I love everything you do to me."

I crooked my finger, enjoying the way his breath caught. I moved my hand faster along his cock. "I want you to come for me, Rock."

"Don't worry. I'm not going to be able to resist, love."

"Then don't," I commanded, changing our roles for once.

His body grew taut, and then he came with a shout, my name on his lips. I pumped his c**k until there was nothing left. Rock's shoulders slumped and he turned to me.

I stood up and took him into my arms.

"Let's get that bath now while the water's still hot." He gazed at me through half closed eyes, and heat ran through my already soaked pu**y.

He took my hand and led me to the bathroom. I squeezed his hot palm, my eyes filling with tears.

How can I leave him in two hours?

I glanced at my watch again, hoping he wouldn't catch me at it. 2:25.

Rock undressed me the rest of the way, taking his time with my garters and panties as he ran his fingers through the slick wetness between my legs. I clung to him, moaning. It wouldn't take much to put me into a state of total bliss.

I removed his shirt, sprinkling kisses on his chest while I did. A salty, scalding tear seared my cheek. I hoped he wouldn't notice.

Rock helped me into the tub, staring into my eyes as he lowered me into the bubbly, scented warmth. "Hey, what's wrong?"

"Nothing."

"It doesn't look like nothing, but I'm going to make you feel better."

He sank into the hot water with me, his skin glistening in the wetness. Before I could speak again, his hands were on me, under the water. I whimpered and lay back, closing my eyes as he worked his magic on my clit, teasing me.

"God, you're gorgeous, Lace."

The words thrilled me, and my skin prickled. I never wanted this night to end, never wanted him away from me.

"What is it? Please tell me. Was someone rude to you." He stilled his ministrations to my clit, and I groaned.

"No, I'm fine. Just tired." I closed my eyes, hoping to hide my emotions from him.

"Are you sure? Talk to me, Lacey." The caress of his voice and his hands against my h*ps nearly undid me.

"I'm sure," I whispered, though in that moment, the only thing I was sure of was that life without him was going to be something I didn't want.

But I have to do it for him.

"Whatever it is, I'm going to stroke it away." He teased my ni**les with one hand as he moved his fingers against my cl*t in a slow, maddening circle.

"Please, Rock." I spit the words out, teeth clenched. All thought had left my mind. Everything was a burning point of desire between my legs.

"Please what, baby? Say it." The hard note I knew so well had returned to his voice, and his hand slid up my shoulder, wrapping around my neck.

Rock squeezed lightly, and the pleasure grew to an almost unbearable peak with the loss of breath and his hand on my nubbin.

"Come for me, Lacey. Do it now." His words were a command, not a request.

As usual, my body responded to his demand at once, and I spiraled into orgasm, the world going black even as he slid his hand back down to my breast and moved his fingers inside my pu**y.

"Oh, God. I want you inside me," I panted, my pu**y clenching around him as I forced my eyes back open. The world was hazy.

"Sounds like a plan," he whispered and picked me up halfway out of the bath.

I clung to him as our lips met. His kiss was like fire, all consuming and all I wanted, other than his cock.

As if he'd read my mind, Rock lowered me onto his stiff rod, and I groaned with pleasure as I bore down on him.

"Lacey," he murmured, his hands in my hair, his lips against my neck then.

"Rock, I..." I stopped, heat flowing over me that had little to do with the water.

The words I love you had come to me without thought.

"What? You can tell me?"

I moved up, and he groaned and clasped my h*ps as we flowed in a dance.

"Nothing." I smiled, gazing deep into his eyes. I wanted to look at my watch madly, needed to hoard every last second with the man I loved, the man who had my heart.

"I want you." He thrust into me with a bellow.

I whimpered, his lust taking me to new heights.

"I'm coming. You feel so damn good, like you were made for me."

I gasped at his words, unable to look into those eyes as he shouted his release. I rode the wave with him, the orgasm more powerful than any I'd experienced with him.

He folded me into his arms, and it was all I could do not to weep. "Oh, Lacey. So, we're heading to California, huh?" Rock stroked my hair, sending shivers through me.

"Yes, in a few days, right?" I gave him a bright smile.

"That's right, and I've been thinking a lot." He cocked his head, a slight frown on his face.

"What?" I hoped in some irrational way that he would call the faux engagement and trip off now, that I wouldn't have to leave him. That we could still be together and Lucifer would leave us alone, spare his life.

"That I love you. That I want you to be my wife."

I scooted out of his embrace so quickly that water flew into my mouth. "What? What are you saying?" I wanted to kick myself at that reaction, but my heart was pounding too fast for me to think.

"Just what I said." Rock leaned back, sighing as he looked at me lazily from under half closed eyelids. A strange looked passed over his features. "I'll confess that I was afraid of getting too close, of letting you see my feelings for you. This was never meant to be more than a business deal, after all. But it turned into much more than that, and I'm happy it did." A small smile curved his lips.

3:25 a.m.

"Oh." I stalled for time. What to say? This didn't change anything about someone planning to kill him if we married. In fact, it only made things worse.

"This is crazy." I climbed out of the tub, wrapping a warm towel around me.

"Hardly." Rock smiled, running his fingers through the water like an indolent child used to having his way. "So, what's your answer?"

I laughed, shivering from the water on my skin. "You want an answer now-just like that?"

"If you're ready to give it." Rock rose from the heat of the tub in one deft movement. He grabbed his own towel, but not until he'd given me an eyeful.

Heat coursed through my body at the sight.

I could have this man in my bed, in my life. Mine. My husband.

Then the doubts crowded in. Even if there were no killer, how long would a man like Rock stay interested in a woman like me? There would be another bookkeeper, another woman to seduce...

"Lacey." Rock's voice was rough, his breath cool against my skin where he stood behind me.

"Yes?"

"Do you need more time?"

"No. I'll marry you." I fixed a smile to my face and yawned, turning to him.

"A real wedding, a real marriage. I don't want the farce. The real thing will accomplish the effects as it is, and I can't imagine something like that not being real...not where you're concerned." He brushed hair from my eyes.

"I can't believe it." I covered my mouth as if yawning again.

"Me neither. It looks like you're bushed and that my plans for that smokin' hot body of yours will have to wait. But I will...till tomorrow anyway." Rock winked, and desire and regret and a million other emotions sizzled through my veins.

I wanted to cry out, to tell him everything, but I couldn't. I knew Lucifer wasn't playing with me. The threat to Rock's life, not to mention the company, was very real. "I am bushed. Totally." I took his hand in mine, leading him out of the bathroom.

3:31.

* * * *

I curled up next to Rock in bed, a strange sensation for me-one that I wanted to revel in. The clean scent of him, the feel of his skin under my fingers nearly made me break down. But I couldn't. He needed me not to, even if he didn't know it.

"I love you, Lacey," Rock murmured, his voice full of sleep.

"I love you, too," I whispered, struggling to keep my voice even as tears rolled down my cheek.

His breathing grew even, and I tested my ability to scoot out from under his arm. He didn't move when I did. I gave it until 3:50 a.m. Then I pulled on my clothes, silent as a cat. I scribbled a note on the hotel pad of paper on the nightstand.

I'm so sorry, Rock. I just can't do this.

~Lacey

And walked out the door with my handbag, not looking back.

Pushing my feelings down, I darted toward the elevator, praying George wasn't nearby. I didn't see him, but that probably meant he was patrolling the hallway. The hotel room was quite secure, though, and I wasn't sure what Rock's instructions to him had been. I made it into the elevator, breathing hard as I pushed "lobby" and bit my lip, drawing blood.

"Hurry up." I whizzed through space to the bottom floor and ran out and into the lobby. No one was there but a couple of concierges. They didn't even look up when I flew outside the door of the hotel. Running to the street, I prayed that a cab would stop.

It did.

"Airport, please."

The driver nodded and sped off into the inky darkness of Venice. I let myself cry then, heavy, silent tears.

* * * *

"I need to get on that plane now." The early flight was taking off at 6:30 a.m. to London. From there, I could go to Atlanta and catch a cab to my cousin's house.

The woman nodded and smiled. "Two more seats left." I sighed in relief and almost sobbed at the intensity of the feeling.

I love you, Rock. I wish I could wake up beside you later.

Even then, I prayed he wouldn't wake up for some time and that when he did, he wouldn't hate me-or come looking for me.

"Miss?"

I nodded and took my ticket. I went through customs and the rest, thanking my lucky stars that I'd decided to carry my passport on me as so many tourists did. What a stroke of luck. Customs went smoothly, and soon I found myself waiting to board. I glanced down the hallway for signs of a handsome, rumpled CEO billionaire, my heart in my throat.

"Boarding for Flight 1005 to London," the crisp, accented voice called.

I stood, tears in my eyes as I made my way to the ticket man.

* * * *

"My God, Lacey. Are you okay? You sound terrible." My cousin Julie's voice dripped with concern.

"I'm okay. Just really tired. Flew from Venice to London, and here I am in the Atlanta airport." It was early morning there as I stood in the busy hub.

"All right. I wish I could come get you..."

"No worries. I'll catch a cab. You have Joey to take care of." I smiled at the thought of the little boy.

"Yes, I do, and he didn't sleep last night. Babies." Julie sighed. "I'm so excited. I want to hear all about Venice when you get here."

"Sure thing. See you soon."

I clicked end on my phone, my limbs heavy with sadness and lack of sleep.

Rock. Where are you now?

* * * *

"Lacey, wow. You look...I don't know." Julie said, after she'd hugged me.

"Exhausted." I cracked a smile that didn't reach my heart.

"Sleep now. I'll ask questions later. You're staying for a while, right? Tom's working so much it would be amazing to have you here. He won't even be home until late tonight." Julie's gaze raked over me, and I blushed.

This dress and these heels are hardly appropriate.

It was so rumpled, I must look homeless.

"I think so. We'll see. Thanks, Julie, for taking me in like this." I walked inside the house, her eyelids drooping at the thought of sleep.

"Whatever. Go rest. Guest bedroom's upstairs, first on the right in case you don't remember."

"Thanks." Once I was upstairs, I let the tears flow.

Sleep came quickly in spite of the feeling that my heart had broken into a million dull, jagged pieces that pierced my lungs with every breath.

"Rock..." I whispered as I drifted off, burrowing my head into the lavender-scented pillow.

He came to me in a dream some time later.

"Lacey."

His lips on mine were electric, and I fell into him. Soon, my br**sts were on fire, ni**les tingling as he stroked them. We lay together on a bed with silken sheets, so like we had in Venice. His hands were between my legs, driving me to ecstasy as I clenched his ass, panting for more.

"Where are you?" Rock asked, his lips against my neck, teeth sharp and biting.

Tears stung my cheeks, and I sat up with a start.

"It was only a dream."

The bedroom was pitch black, full of dense shadows.

How long did I sleep?

The dull ache in my heart made me catch my breath.

Not long enough. I could sleep forever.

I noticed the small flat screen TV in a corner after I'd flipped on a lamp. Heart racing, I turned it on, scanning through stations.

A pretty reporter on CNN reported with wide eyes.

"...is offering a reward of $1,000,000 for the return of Lacey Pate, his fiancee. If you have any information, please contact this number in the U.S. Mr. Weldon. You will receive a reward for your efforts. The CEO billionaire of Regal Enterprises is on his way back to the U.S via his private jet. He says he will stop at nothing to find Lacey and believes there is foul play in the situation of her disappearance."

I sat in stunned silence, licking my lips. For the first time, I wondered if Rock would actually find me and whether I had put my cousin and family in danger by staying with them.

"No." I jumped up from the bed.

"Lacey, open up." Julie banged on the door.

She knows. She saw the news.

I closed my eyes, sighing.

I'm so not ready for this.

"Lacey, are you all right?" Her voice was softer now.

"I'm fine. Hang on. Just woke up." I turned the TV off and walked to the door, full of dread.

I opened the door for her. I hadn't remembered locking it.

"Sorry. Didn't know it was locked."

"What in God's name is going on?" she whispered, hurrying to the bed and plopping down. She crossed her arms, staring at me.

"It's a long story."

"So, you're engaged to Rock Weldon?" Disbelief dripped from her voice.

"I was." I knitted my fingers together.

"Wow. I can't even imagine. How did you meet?"

"At a party. He hired me as a bookkeeper. It was a freak thing, really." I shrugged, trying to keep my tone nonchalant.

"Amazing. So, is he a nice guy?" Julie asked, her eyes wide.

"Yeah, he is. The best." My throat was thick with tears, and I looked away from her.

"I'm sorry. I hate to ask this, but...are we in danger? What the hell is really going on, because I know no woman in her right mind who was in love with a rich and wonderful guy like Rock Weldon would leave his side in Venice to come see me here in Georgia." Julie snorted and reached out, squeezing my hand.

"I don't think you are. I don't know." I squeezed my eyes shut. "I'm so sorry. I'll leave in a few hours." I stood abruptly, feeling horrible for not thinking things through more fully.

What if Lucifer comes here? What if...?

I shut off my hysterical stream of thought.

"No. No way. We'll be fine." She grabbed my arm and held me there gently. "Tom's home in bed. We have guns. I know how to use them."

I smiled at her through the tears in my mind. "Are you sure? I'd never forgive myself if-"

"Shh. Don't ask again. If any bastard comes in here with killing on his mind, he doesn't stand a chance. You don't mess with an armed Southerner." Julie's mouth was set in a thin line.

I laughed in spite of the serious nature of the situation. "For some reason, that makes me feel better."

"Get some more rest. I won't bother you again, but I do want to hear all about Rock Weldon whenever you feel like it." Julie winked.

I kissed her on the cheek. "Thanks so much. This means more to me than you'll ever know."

"I know you've got my back, too, cuz."

She hugged me and left me to the silence.

* * * *

My cell phone rang an hour later as I was drifting into a fitful sleep.

"Hello?" Too late I realized I should have just left it.

"Lacey? What the hell are you doing? Where are you?"

Rock.

I started to respond then bit my lip, tears springing to my eyes.

"Lacey? I want to come to you. Has someone threatened you?" Rock's voice was hard yet tender, and I wanted to tell him, but I couldn't.

I won't have him die on my account.

I hung up the phone, sobbing. It rang again, and I turned it off.

Please don't find me. I want you to live, company or no company. At least you'll be alive if I don't stay in the picture.

I got up then, unable to sleep anymore. Parting the curtains, I gazed out the window. A shadowy figure stood there, under a streetlight. I imagined I saw a mask.

"Lucifer." Icy hands gripped my heart, and I was frozen in fear for a moment.

The man didn't move, and I backed away from the window slowly. When I went back a few minutes later, my breath coming in shallow gulps, no one was there.

* * * *

"So you're just going to hang out here?" Julie glanced at me where I sat at the kitchen table. She had Joey in hand, ready to go.

"Yeah. I'll be fine."

"If you want me to skip-"

"No. Don't. You and Joey have fun at the playdate."

"We will. Be back in a few hours with some lunch." Julie grinned.

"Thanks. See you then."

Tom had left for work hours before and wouldn't be back until late. I tried to hide my jumpiness with a plastered-on smile as my cousin and little Joey left. I watched her Land Rover pull out of the driveway. An emptiness filled me, along with fear.

I padded into the large den, admiring the bookshelves. Pulling down a volume of L. M. Montgomery-Anne of Green Gables seemed nice and safe-I sat on the couch and read. The happy story kept thoughts of Rock at bay for a while.

Until someone knocked on the door.

"Dammit." I sat there, frozen.

"Delivery for Ms. Rawlings."

That would be Julie.

I bit my lip, torn. Standing quietly, I craned my neck to see the kitchen door. Just as I'd decided whoever was there had left-package be damned-the door exploded inward.

* * * *

I screamed and ran for the stairs, not stopping to think. I made it to my bedroom as the voices of a couple men came to me. Pushing the door shut, I locked it and pulled the old fashioned chain. Scrambling for my cell phone, I pressed it on, praying. To put another door between me and whoever was in the house-Lucifer was my guess, whoever that was-I ran into the adjoining bathroom. Luckily, it only had the one entrance, from my room.

I dialed 911 with shaking hands and whispered into the phone. I waited to hear voices as I did so.

"We're on the way," the dispatcher said.

Just then, the phone trilled. I gasped. It was Rock.

"Hello?"

"Lacey. I'm nearing your cousin's house. I'll be there in three minutes. You're coming with me when I get there."

Happiness flooded me at his words even as reason warred with the sentiment.

"No. You can't. Someone just broke into the house. It's not safe. Please don't come. The police are on the way." My lip trembled. "I won't lose you, Rock. You almost died when you were shot."

"I'm coming, and no one's going to stop me."

The phone clicked in my ear as the bedroom door opened with a crack of wood.

"Come out, Lacey. We're done with games."

The man who called himself Lucifer stood there, but it was clear to me who he was now. He didn't bother to disguise his voice. I gripped the sink, knowing he would have the bathroom door open in seconds.

John Weldon.

What I'd feared was true. My heart ached for Rock, even as it skipped in fear for my own life.

"Lacey, this door won't keep me from you." John laughed.

"Why are you doing this?" I asked, hoping to stall for time. Only a minute had passed since Rock had hung up. I had no idea who else might be with John either.

"You know why. I went to jail for murder. I've waited all this time, and Rock has never repaid me. I'm sick of hoping, Lacey. I decided to take what's mine. I was going to skip out of the company and fall off the map, but Rock checked his own books for once, and I knew it was over. He wouldn't stop until he found out what was going on. I couldn't have that. So, he'll die instead, and I'll keep the money I've stolen. And I'll run the company one day. I'm good at covering my tracks-usually. Money buys that ability." He laughed, a craven sound.

"You won't get away with it." My voice shook, sounding like a squeak.

"Oh but I will." The door splintered, and I cowered in a corner, wishing I were braver. Scanning the room for a weapon, my gaze fell on a fancy pewter plunger.

It's better than nothing.

I grabbed it and waited, hoping beyond hope that Rock was on his way.

Please God. Keep him safe even if I don't make it.

"Time to say your last-"

John Weldon's words were interrupted with a shot. A groan came from another man as another shot rang out.

I sank to the bathroom floor in stunned silence.

"Lacey. It's me. You're safe now. Let's go."

Rock.

I forced the door open past the bodies and ran into his arms. "Go where?"

"The police are already here. We're going to talk with them and go to California." Rock kissed my forehead, and I thought I might faint from the unreality.

"You...you killed John?" I was shaking so hard I had to cling to him even tighter. I still couldn't believe he was real.

"Of course. When I saw what was going on, what other choice did I have? John wouldn't have given me any other out if he'd seen me. I managed to sneak up on him."

Sirens blared outside. I jumped.

"Let's go. I'll talk you through it. I don't anticipate much hassle from them. All I have to do is turn over the books and show them what was going on-that John was stealing from me." Rock brushed my hair back from my forehead, and I gripped his hand as we walked downstairs.

"Thank you. I love you," I whispered, surprising myself with my bravery.

"I love you, too. I'm just glad I made it. Why did you leave me?" We'd reached the bottom floor.

"John was going to kill you. I didn't want to, but I wasn't going to cost you your life." Tears flowed then, and Rock stopped me, holding my hands out and looking into my eyes as he spoke, cops be damned.

"Lacey, I don't know if anyone's ever truly loved me like that. Certainly John didn't. He did once, but it all got twisted up somehow. I don't know how he thought we were enemies. I believed I'd given him all I could, and there was so much more I had planned." Rock's voice broke, and I squeezed his hand.

"Don't blame yourself. You can't account for a man who's lost his mind, much as you may have loved him." I stroked his cheek.

"Excuse me, Mr. Weldon."

Rock smiled at me shakily and turned to the policemen. "We're ready to give statements."

* * * *

"Where to?" Rock asked me, holding my hand at the kitchen table. Julie and her family were due home in a few minutes.

"I don't know. I feel lost." I sighed.

"You're not lost. I found you." He leaned forward, kissing me gently. Then the touch of his lips became something else, a scorching, demanding fire.

"Rock." I breathed his name, my voice shaky as I pulled away.

"I know. Everyone will be here soon. I'll behave, I promise...for the next hour or so, anyway. Then I want to whisk you away somewhere. Name the place. Any ideas, lovely?" He gazed into my eyes, and my heart completed a slow flip.

"How about California-back home? I guess it's really up to you, though. You're still my employer for the next eleven months. That is, if I didn't breach my contract." I smiled nervously, unsure of where we stood after all of this. I loved him. He said he loved me, but what did that mean to a man like Rock?

Rock steepled his fingers, studying me. "Not so much. I took a leave of absence from the company to find you. You've probably noticed my phone isn't beeping every second."

I grinned. "Yeah." Excitement and nervousness warred inside me.

"So, it's up to you. Where would you like to get married, Lacey Pate?"

I sat there for a beat, my mouth hanging open. Then the door burst inward.

"Oh my God! I'm so glad you're okay." Julie ran to me, wrapping me in an embrace.

"I'm so, so sorry, Julie." Tears flowed again.

"Don't even think that way."

Tom nodded at me. "We're just glad you're all right and that you trusted us enough to come here." He gave Rock a suspicious glance.

"Hey, Tom, can you take Joey to the den to play?" Julie asked.

"Sure." Tom and Joey left, the toddler chattering about policemen.

"Thanks," I said, the air thick with unsaid things.

"Rock Weldon." Rock stood in one graceful move and held his hand out to Julie.

She shook it, and I didn't miss her eyes growing larger. "Julie Rawlings. Nice to meet you. So you saved Lacey's life?"

"I did, but I'm afraid it was her association with me that endangered her in the first place-and your family. My sincerest apologies for all of this." He spread his hands.

"Apology accepted. All's well that ends well." Julie laughed nervously.

"Thank you for everything." I hugged her tightly.

"What's next for you guys? Can you stay for a late dinner?"

I smiled. "No, but I appreciate the offer. It's time we got out of your hair. Let me go say goodbye to Tom and Joey."

When I returned, Rock and Julie were deep in conversation.

"Ready? Did you bring anything with you?"

I shook my head. "Not really. The clothes on my back and a few other items is about it. Let me grab my purse."

Rock smiled, and I felt their gazes on me as I climbed the stairs.

I stopped inside the bedroom, catching my breath.

What Rock had said before Julie walked in...did he really mean it?

"No way." But my heart said differently with every nervous bump.

"I wish you all the best, Lacey," Julie said, tears in her eyes.

"You too. Thanks again." I wiped at my cheeks, wondering what Rock had said to her.

"Call me, Lacey. Don't make it when you're running from some maniac either." She laughed lightly.

"I won't. I swear. Bye."

"Goodbye, Julie. Thanks again," Rock said as he opened the door for me.

"You take care of her."

Julie's words rang in my ears. I wasn't dreaming.

"We're free to leave the state."

Before I could respond to that comment, Rob, Rock's driver, came around the side of a limousine.

"How did you get here?" I asked stupidly.

"Flew in as soon as I knew where Mr. Weldon was heading." He smiled.

"Thank you." I grabbed his hand, startling him.

"Of course. I love working for Mr. Weldon and his friends."

I could see in his eyes that he meant it.

"I'm the lucky one to have you, Rob." Rock slapped him gently on the shoulder.

Tears gathered in my throat. I love this man so much. He's kind and sexy. The wealth is a crazy bonus.

Rob helped us into the limo, and Rock slid my hand into his. "I was serious about you having the choice of where you want to go. I was thinking a small ceremony, but if you want to fly everyone in and have it in a week or so, that's your choice, too. I just don't know if I can wait any longer than that to make you my wife. I came too close to losing you, Lacey." He traced a circle on the inside of my palm with his thumb, and I shivered, desire running through me.

I closed my eyes, thinking about where I wanted to be with Rock. We could go anywhere in the country.

"Honestly, I'd like to go back to your place and get married tomorrow-just the two of us. We can do something bigger later on." I spoke hesitantly, still wanting to pinch myself.

"My place, huh?" He gazed at me, his eyes sparkling with surprise in the darkness of the car.

"Yes, because that's where this all began," I whispered.

He pulled me into his arms then, just where I wanted to be. Rock sprinkled kisses down my neck, and I finally noticed how slowly we were driving.

"To the airport, Rob. We're heading home."

* * * *

Rock's jet was a familiar and welcome sight.

"What? No Nadia?" I teased him as we boarded a little while later.

"No. She's gone. I don't want anything to upset you-past or present. God knows I already have enough to atone for." A sad note crept into his voice.

I took his hand and led him to the bedroom. "Hey, Mr. CEO. No more of that. You're an honorable man, and you've whipped yourself long enough over guilt." My throat tightened.

"But John..." he trailed off as he sat down on the bed, head in his hands.

"Shh. He made his choice. You didn't force him to act recklessly out of what I can only assume was jealousy and hatred."

"My God, what I've lost." His voice broke. I sank next to him on the bed, my arm around him. He looked at me. "And what I've gained." He gave me a shaky smile.

"What we've both gained, you mean," I whispered.

A sudden light entered his eyes then. "Yes, and I need you now, Lacey." The statement was harsh and raw.

"Then I'm yours to do with as you will." Wetness pooled between my legs at the thought, and I saw myself as he must. Jean-clad and rumpled.

"Get undressed." His tone brooked no argument. "I want to watch, so do it slowly."

I swallowed and nodded, my old insecurities rising to the surface.

He's going to marry me. Me. Lacey who didn't have a job until this fell into my lap.

I pulled my shirt off as slowly as I could, glad I was wearing the sexy pink bra and panties he'd given me. With a pang, I found myself hoping he'd gotten all my nice things and brought them with you.

"You're so gorgeous. I can't wait to be inside you," he rasped, watching me through heavy lidded eyes now.

My ni**les were hard, pressing against the bra painfully. I slid my jeans off and shivered in the cool of the cabin.

"Sir, are you ready for takeoff? We'll leave at your word." The pilot spoke through a speaker, making me jump and giggle.

"Yes, and I don't want to be disturbed during the flight. I'll call if I need anything."

"Of course, Mr. Weldon. Enjoy your flight."

Rock smiled, licking his lips. My body flushed all over in response. "I will. Thank you, Sammy."

"Ah, where were we?" He smiled at me. "Leave the bra and panties on and bend over my lap. I think you need a spanking for leaving me all alone in Venice."

I gaped at him.

"Be a good girl, now."

I finally broke out of my shock and walked slowly toward him. Would this man ever fail to surprise me? I didn't think so.

Rock crooked a finger at me, inviting me to lean over his lap, ass up, face down. My face grew warm at the thought of his view.

"I love these pink panties. Note to self: buy more of this shade for my gorgeous, soon-to-be wife."

His c**k was hard against my lower stomach as I lay across him.

The first smack of his hand was a shock. I yelped.

"I know you're a bad girl, and that's only the beginning." Rock peeled my underwear down with a jerk and rubbed my ass with a warm hand. Then it grew slick.

Geez. He got the oil out when I wasn't looking.

I almost laughed at the thought of me being able to see much at my current angle. Then his hand on my ass stopped me again.

"Too hard for you?" His voice was a whisper that sent a shudder through me.

"No."

He popped my cheek again, and I clenched my teeth, desire mingling with the pain.

"I hope you don't plan to be a bad girl ever again." He emphasized the last two words.

"No, I don't." I could hardly speak. I was breathless, wondering what he would do to me next.

"Take my pants off."

I slid to the floor in one movement, my pu**y throbbing with arousal. I undid the button and worked at the zipper on his pants, rubbing the length of his c**k through them as I did so.

"That feels good."

I slid my hand down his briefs and pulled his c**k out, running my fingers along its length.

He caught his breath, and I smiled.

"I can't wait. I want you to ride my cock, and I want to see you come, Lacey."

He'd surprised me. "Only if I get to suck you later."

"Maybe." He winked, and my heart skipped a beat.

I stepped out of the underwear that was now on the ground.

"Undo your bra and let me see your pretty br**sts. I love your little pink ni**les."

I closed my eyes, and my pu**y clenched at his words. To be adored by Rock almost overwhelmed me. Then I did what he said, moving slowly as I let the straps fall and unhooked the bra.

"God, I'm hurting looking at you. I've missed you so much," Rock said, motioning me forward.

I positioned his cock, my breath coming in little gasps. When I sank down on him, hooking my legs around his waist, he groaned.

"Lacey, that feels like heaven."

I moved up and down on him-slowly at first.

Then he gripped my hips, grunting with each movement I made. I reveled in the sensation of him filling every inch inside me.

My orgasm built as my cl*t brushed against his skin with each thrust. I moaned at the flutterings of feeling, wanting more quickly. "You're teasing me."

"No, you're teasing me with those lovely tits in my face." Rock captured one in his hand, sucking it.

"Oh, God. I'm going to come." His tongue teasing me wasn't going to let me last long.

"Not yet. Not till I say."

I whimpered in frustration, at the command in his voice.

He doubled down on his licking and sucking until I was writhing on top of him, urging him to come so I could, too.

"Come for me, Lacey."

I responded to him immediately, shouting my release with a guttural sound. I felt him clench and explode inside of me. He clung to me, whispering my name over and over again like a prayer, his arms around me, head against my br**sts.

Tears flowed freely from my eyes and when he lifted his face, I saw them glinting in his own dark green orbs.

"I can't wait."

"For what?" I asked, brushing a strand of hair back from his damp forehead.

"To see you coming down the staircase. What color will your dress be?"

"Pearly pink if we can get it." I smiled and kissed his nose.

"I'm already on it. Pearly pink it is, as long as you're the bride." Rock pulled me down on the bed beside him and captured me again with his kiss.

"Forever," I whispered into the hushed world of us two.
