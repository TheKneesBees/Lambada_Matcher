He was everything I'd never had before. Not just physically, but who he was, inside and out. He was young, strong, kind...and oh my Lord, so innocent.

I met him in church. He was sitting near the back, staring out the window and not really paying attention. He was the first person I saw when I walked in those chipped white doors with their faded brass handles. He was coiled into the pew, his knees drawn up, his back hunched, long fingers tapping his broad thighs. His messy black hair swept across his brow, covering one eye before he brushed it away absently with a thumb. I barely managed to avoid stumbling on a rip in the threadbare carpet when my heel caught. I was so busy taking in the absurd beauty of him that I just about fell flat on my face.

He saw me, then, too, and I think the awe in his eyes is what did it for me. He looked at me like he'd never seen a woman before, he looked at me like a man in a desert looks at a wellspring. I'd never had anyone look at me like that, with a nak*d desire, unadorned wonder.

The only open seat was at the aisle-end, one row up from him. I took it and sat down just as the white-haired old lady left off her godawful pounding on the poor little tan upright piano. She'd been murdering "Old Rugged Cross" as the congregation took their places, and I was the last one in. Apropos, that was. It was at least ten years since I'd last been in a church-outside of weddings and Christmas-so coming into this little Reformed Baptist chapel was an act of will, a challenge to myself.

I'd fled back to the South after things with Dan went to hell, just packed a couple bags, withdrew all the money in my hidden account and hopped the first plane away from nasty old Atlantic City. I wanted distance, I wanted space, I wanted away. I got off the plane in Atlanta, rented a car and drove West until I hit Jackson, Mississippi, and I spent the night there in a seedy old motel off the freeway, roach-infested, stinking to high-heaven, and oh my Lord, so quiet.

I grew up in the South, a couple of lifetimes ago. Dan had swept me away from Savannah when I was sixteen, lured me north with promises of money and excitement and fun and endless sex, and he'd provided all that for a few years, and then things changed, as things do with men like him. He got bored, I guess. I wasn't exciting anymore, wasn't new and shiny and tempting. All I can do is guess though, 'cause Dan never told me anything. Just flung money at me and left me for his call girls and his whores and his gambling bunnies and who knows what else. I doubt he ever noticed I was gone, probably. He didn't care what I did, and he was so rich from owning the casino that I could siphon off money left and right and he never said a word. I started that about two years in, when I realized he didn't really love me. It took a long time, but eventually I had enough money stashed away that I knew I could make it on my own, and I split.

By then, of course, he never bothered with me. Rarely came home, never spoke to me. I was just the trophy wife, beautiful and pointless. I tried to find satisfaction elsewhere, once, with one of the card dealers, but Dan made it violently clear, to me and to the poor dealer, that he wouldn't stand for it. I never tried that again.

So, I ran off with a couple million dollars and no clue what to do with myself.

I buzzed north from Jackson in my little Audi Quattro, top down, feeling finally free. I'd spent a while in Jackson, maybe a year, a year and a half, just taking time to be me. Then, one day, I up and took a little drive, followed US-49 into this little tiny place in the middle of nowhere, full of nothing. It was slow and sleepy and beautiful in its own way, and I liked it, found an empty house to rent, filled it with new things, moved in, and that was how I ended up in little Yazoo City.

The thing to remember about the South is that in little places like Yazoo, you go to church. You just do. You don't have to believe it, but you pay your dues and pretend, like everyone else.

I picked that church because it was a cute little building, white clapboards and three cracked concrete steps and a steeple with a black iron bell. There was a cemetery out back behind it, all ancient headstones from the civil war and before, surrounded by a tall wrought-iron fence. Farther back still was a little knoll crowned by a spreading oak tree, complete with a rope swing. I pictured myself on the swing, just kicking my heels in the humid air, and that was it...that was the church I'd go to.

Oh my Lord, how little did I know what that decision would start.

Sitting there, listening to the pastor's booming, stentorian voice, I felt the dark-haired young man watching me, trying gamely not to stare, and failing. I liked his eyes on me. I felt sexy, just sitting there, with his chocolate eyes straining for a glimpse of my br**sts.

He was maybe twenty-one, twenty-two, and he had the tan skin and lean muscle of a man who spends all his time outside, working hard and playing hard. He had a thin white scar along his jaw, and I wondered how he'd gotten it. His hands were toying with the crease in his khaki pants, and I wanted, so badly, to feel those hands on me. That wanting him to touch me, it was a sudden desire, springing up in my belly and taking hold. It was silly, cause I was turning thirty-four in a few weeks, and I'd just gotten shut of a man, yet here I was, wanting this sexy beast of a guy, just out of his teens.

I was twisted in the pew, sitting sideways with my legs crossed, a casual enough position, but one carefully thought-out to let me look at him, and to give him a good eyeful of my thighs and my br**sts. I'd dressed in the nicest clothes I had, which I realized as soon as I walked in were too nice, too revealing, too expensive.

The sermon dragged on forever, and the entire time, he and I were making eyes at each other, trading I-wasn't-staring glances away. When the old woman sat down at the piano and dug into a horrific rendition of "Oh What A Friend We Have In Jesus", I bolted. I mean, I nearly ran out of that church. I clicked down the steps in my too-high heels, stretching my legs as far as my too-tight skirt would let me.

He wasn't far behind, although I didn't dare look to see. I could feel him, though. His eyes were on my ass as I climbed the hill, and I gave my h*ps an extra sway on my way to the swing. The ropes were scratchy, fuzzy, generations-old hemp, the fibers sticking to my palms as I gripped them, and the weathered, gray wooden plank seat was rough, small, and hard under my bottom. I kicked my heels gently, giving me a little momentum. I kept my knees pressed together as he approached, a life-long habit of a woman who's spent her life in skirts.

When he made it up the hill and stood staring at me, mouth open a little as he hunted for words, I let my knees go apart, just a touch. I had to make myself do it though. My mind and my libido wanted me to let him get a glimpse, just a teasing look, but physical habit wanted me to keep my knees together.

My libido won.

His eyes darted to my thighs, to the little triangle of darkness between them. His zipper bulged out slightly, and I let my knees part a bit more. He was still looking for something to say, and I could see his hands shaking a little. Looking at him, then, I realized he wasn't just another congregation member; he had the same jaw and the same long nose as the pastor, the same towering height, although he was still lean and fit, where the pastor was running to two or three spare tires around his middle. This was the pastor's son. The preacher's kid. My own father had been a preacher, before he died of a heart attack the year I left with my Dan. I knew what PK's were like: sheltered, sequestered, kept innocent of the world and its wicked ways. Kept away from women like me.

I took pity on his awkwardness. "Hi," I said, sticking out my hand.

"Hi." His voice didn't break, but it was pitched low, as if he was afraid to talk too loud.

He shook my hand gently, not limp or featherlight, and not crushing, just a gentle, firm touch. His eyes kept wandering to my cl**vage, and I found myself arching my back to make my br**sts look bigger, to give him a better show.

"I'm Shea," I said. "Shea Harley."

He smiled, a bright, amused grin. "Shea Harley? Wow, that's a cool name." He ducked his head, and a lock of black hair fell across his eye; I was already growing to adore that stray lock of hair and the thumb that brushed it aside. "I'm Tre."

He said it "Tray". I must've given him a curious look, because he shrugged his shoulders and looked embarrassed.

"It's a nickname. My initial are T-R-E: Timothy Robert Evan. I hate my name, so I go by Tre."

I kept swinging, letting my foot brush his leg at each apex. "I like that. Tre. It fits you so much better than Tim. You're not a Tim." He shifted forward, and when I swung forward again, I let my foot slide up his calf to the back of his knee.

It was a first hesitant flirt, just to see how he'd react. He glanced at the offending foot, and then at me, as if wondering what I could mean by it, and what he was supposed to do in return. I could see him thinking, figuring, wondering.

"So, Tre. What do you do?"

He shrugged. "I work at a garage, changing oil and fixing cars and such. Daddy wants me to go to seminary, but I'm just not sure I want to. I ain't decided yet."

"Your dad's the preacher, right?"

"Yep. Although don't let him hear you call him 'Preacher'. He's a pastor, he says. He's got a whole lecture on how a pastor is called to the pulpit and his flock, while anyone can preach."

"And you don't want to be a pastor?" I swung forward again, and this time I caught myself on his legs with my feet, hanging there by my hooked toes, and then swinging free again.

Tre shrugged again, but I could tell there was a lot on his mind, a lot expressed by that nonchalant shrug. "Not really. I just ain't felt the call, you know? I never been outside of Mississippi, and I've barely ever left Yazoo. I just...I don't know. Seems like there might be more out there for me than one little town, one little church, for all my life."

He fell silent, and he seemed embarrassed. I don't think he meant to say all that.

"Well, I think you oughta make your own choices," I said, standing up.

There was only two steps between us, and I took one, so I was just inside his personal space. My br**sts were nearly brushing his chest, and he was valiantly trying to keep his eyes on mine.

"You know, you're right about one thing, Tre. There is a whole world out there. You just never know what you might find." I fanned my face with my hand. "It sure is hot out here, isn't it?"

I had my blouse buttoned up to just above my cl**vage, and the button at the bulge of my br**sts was straining. I met his eyes, held them, and slowly, so slowly let my hand drift up to that button, touched it with my finger. Tre's tongue touched the corner of his lips, and I nearly kissed him then. He knew I was playing a game, so I kept playing it. He was waiting, and I drew the moment out. I circled the little white button with my index finger, then pinched it and pushed it through, tugged my blouse apart so a greater expanse of cl**vage was revealed.

It took a lot longer, then, for his burning mocha eyes to return to mine.

"You're hot," he blurted, then closed his eyes in acute embarrassment.

I laughed, shifting forward, closer to him. "Thank you, Tre. I think you're pretty hot, yourself."

He looked confused by this. "You do?"

I nodded. "Mmmmm-hmmm. I do. You're sexy." He blushed scarlet.

He seemed to be trying to come up with something else to say. "No one's ever told me that, before."

"Well, you are. If they all can't see that, well...they're blind." I was pressed up against him, now, not crushed closed like I wanted to be, but close.

He was looking down at me, searching my eyes like they held some inscrutable secret. "Shea, I should probably go. My dad's gonna wonder where I'm at. We usually have lunch after sermon."

"Aww," I said, genuinely disappointed. "I was hoping to talk to you some more."

"You were?" He seemed shocked by that.

"Yeah, I was. Maybe you could come over to my house, sometime, have some sweet tea with me."

He shifted his weight, obviously struggling with the decision. After a long moment, he nodded. "I'm off work all day tomorrow."

I dug in my purse, pulled out an old gas station receipt and scribbled my address on it. He needed something bold, a gesture that'd hint at what I really wanted; I slipped the card into his back pocket, and I left my hand there, not squeezing-although Lord knows I wanted to grope his tight little ass-just resting in his pocket. I kissed him, just for good measure. It was a light thing, a peck on his lips, a lingering touch. He tensed, startled, and then parted his lips against mine, making the kiss into something more.

I pulled away first, and he looked disappointed.

"Why don't you swing by around lunchtime?" I said.

He just nodded, licking his lips, probably still tasting my lipstick. He looked shocked, both at me and at himself.

I hoped he'd show up the next day. I wanted to show him what he'd been missing all his life, and it sure as shit wasn't sweet tea I had in mind.

My own hunger surprised me. Watching him go, I felt a twinge of guilt; I was seducing a preacher's kid.

2

He knocked, rather than ringing the doorbell. It was a light, hesitant knock. He was nervous, I could tell just by that. I went to the door, tugging my yellow sundress down, adjusting my br**sts higher. My heart was hammering in my chest. I brushed a lock of my thick black hair back and smoothed my dress over my thighs, opened the door.

He was wearing tight blue jeans and a plain white T-shirt with a thick leather belt. Oh, my Lord. His arms were brawny and bulging with the power of youth, and the shirt clung to his stomach. I felt desire pooling in my belly, turning to fire as his eyes devoured my body.

"You're here," I said.

It felt like a foolish thing to say, but he just nodded and stepped inside, brushing close to me.

"I'm here," he repeated.

I took a deep breath and gathered myself. I wasn't really nervous so much as flushed with anticipation. I closed the door and put my back to it.

"Well, I'm glad you came." I took his hand, leaned in to kiss him.

He kissed me back, clumsy but ardent. I stepped into him, pressing my body up against him. He tensed and pulled away.

"I thought we were having sweet tea?"

I went for broke: "That was just to get you here. I do have sweet tea, but...I had something else in mind."

His eyes darted around the foyer, to the kitchen, and last to the stairs. "You did? What else did you...did you have in mind?"

His confusion was so cute, so innocent. He just didn't want to believe the signals he was obviously receiving in spades. I ran my hands down his chest and back up, touching his cheek. I stared up into his eyes, trying to communicate too much with one little look.

"Well, Tre, it starts with kissing you," I said, and touched my lips to his jaw, then to his ear, then to his neck, still holding one of his hands.

I led that hand to my back and left it there. He took the cue, tentatively exploring my back, daring down my hip, hesitating there. I kept my eyes on his, smiled my encouragement and pushed my br**sts against him. He took a deep breath and moved his hand around from my hip to my backside. I curled into his chest, put my hand to the soft thatch of hair at the back of his neck and pulled him down into a kiss, and this time I made it full and deep, putting a promise into it, slipping my tongue between his lips to touch his.

He pulled away and looked down at me. "What are we doing, Shea?"

I knew he was asking a whole bunch of things. His eyes showed the conflict: desire and guilt.

"I like you. I want you."

"You want me?" He licked his lips, eyes darting over my face and my eyes. "What do you mean, you want me? And why me?"

I laughed. "Why you? I don't know, other than....I like you. I think you're sexy, and I like kissing you. I want to kiss you more."

His eyebrows dug down, and I saw desire winning the war. I ground my h*ps into his, felt the hardening length of his penis through his jeans.

"Is it...should we...I mean..."

"Tre, if you don't think you should, then don't. I want you to want me, but if you don't, then you can go, and nobody will know anything different. So the question is, do you want me?"

"I-yeah, I do, but-"

"Do you like kissing me?"

"Well, yeah, I do, but-"

Time for the clincher: "Do you think kissing me is wrong? Is that what you're afraid of?" He nodded. "Don't be afraid, Tre. Remember how we talked about making your own choices?"

He nodded again, thinking. I could feel the decision clicking into place.

"Make this choice for you, for what you want. It's not about your father, or your future. It's just about you and me," I said. "If you want to go, you can. I'll still be your friend, and I won't be mad or anything. But I would like it if you stayed with me."

His hands both moved to my ass, squeezed, caressed, explored, and he kissed me. "I'll stay," he said, his voice husky.

"Good," I said. "I was hoping you would."

"I'm a little nervous," he said.

"That's okay," I told him. "You're allowed to be. But you don't have to be."

I took him by the hand and led him upstairs to my bedroom, let him stop in the French doorway and take in my room, my king size four-poster bed and the wide window overlooking a field of wildflowers. I led him down the three steps and stood in front of him at the foot of the bed.

I turned around and presented my back, pulling my hair over a shoulder. "Why don't you unzip my dress for me?"

He took the zipper with two trembling fingers and drew it downward, slowly. I stood still and let him go at his own pace. When the zipper was at my waist, put his hands on my bare shoulders and pushed the straps off, letting the dress fall to the floor. I turned around and let him look at me.

"It's okay to look at me," I told him.

"You're so beautiful," he said. "I've never seen a woman like...like this. Like you."

"I know," I said. "Would you like to see more?"

He flushed and smiled in response, and I turned back around.

"Take off my bra, then," I said.

He fumbled with bra, the four hook-and-eyelets frustrating his attempts to free them. He huffed, in embarrassment or frustration.

"It's okay," I said. "Take your time. It can be tricky if you've never done it before."

Finally, he got the bra free and it fell off, freeing my heavy br**sts. I turned around to face him, now just in my panties, a barely-there red lace thong to match the bra. His eyes were about to pop out of his head, then. I stood still and let him look for a long moment before I pressed myself against him.

"Touch me," I said. "You can touch me everywhere. I want you to."

His c*ck pushed against my belly, a huge, hard bulge against the zipper of his jeans. I kissed his chin, and then his lips. He deepened the kiss on his own this time, and we were lost, then, mouths apart and tongues delving, and his hands began to roam over my body, stroking down my spine to my ass, feeling the curve and tracing the crack, hefting the individual globes and moving down my h*ps and back up to my br**sts, crushed between us.

I pulled away and lifted his shirt over his head, tossing it aside. His abs were a wonderland of male perfection, toned and hard, dusted with a trail of hair down into his boxers. I reached with both hands to unbutton his jeans, unzipped them as slowly as I could, pushed them down to his feet. He stepped out of them and kicked them aside. His c*ck was leaking pre-come, moistening his boxers, pressing up against the fabric. He looked down at himself, and seemed embarrassed by the touch of wetness there.

I touched the wet spot. "Don't worry about that. It's normal."

He nodded and touched my n**ples, lifted my breast in a hand.

I wanted to shock him, make him understand my own desire for him. "I want to see your cock," I said. "I want to feel you. You're gorgeous, Tre, do you know that?"

He just shook his head, unable to speak. I curled my fingers inside the band of his boxers and pulled them away from his body, glancing in. I looked up at him and grinned my delight at what I saw, then giggled at the terrified expression on his face. I pulled the flannel-print fabric down around his hips, tugging slowly by the bottom hem, freeing his c*ck in slow increments. Then, with a sudden rush, they fell to the ground and his penis was free, laying up against his belly, wet at the head, throbbing and undulating with his breathing. He was huge, thick and long and straight, and so, so beautiful.

I touched the glistening tip, licked the pre-come off my finger, my eyes locked on his. Then I grabbed him, first with one hand, pumping slowly, then the other, both hands around his pulsating girth and still the tip stood above my hands.

"You are so huge," I told him. "Your c*ck is so perfect. I want it inside me. I want it my p**sy. I want it in my mouth."

He laughed, nervous and disbelieving, his h*ps moving in time with my hands. He was so close, already. His knees were about to buckle.

"Your...your mouth? You would really do that? Put your mouth on my...on my-"

"Say it," I commanded him, slowing my ministrations and leading him to the bed. "Say a dirty word for me."

He lay down on his back, cupping my br**sts as I sat astride him, still wearing my panties. I knew he wouldn't last long enough to even get inside, and I wanted to milk him, feel his c*ck in my hands and see his face as he came. This was just the beginning.

"You'd really put my...cock in your mouth?"

"Oh Tre...there's so much I'm going to do you." I slid downward, taking him in my hands again. "This is just the start. This is just the very beginning of all the things I'm going to do to you."

He gasped when I licked him, his stomach pulling in as I laved the silky, salty length of his dick from the base up to the tip, swirling my tongue around his sensitive head. I cupped his balls in my hand, used my other to grasp him again, sliding my fist around him, tickling him with a gentle fingernail. I kissed the wet head, so pink and soft, and then wrapped my lips around him, taking him in just an inch at first, then moved back out.

"I feel like I'm going to explode," he said, his voice a panting whisper.

"You are," I said. "Haven't you ever jerked off before?"

"No...no," he gasped. "My dad told me it was a sin to touch myself except to...to pee."

He was rocking his h*ps as I moved my hands on his dick, up and down, slow as molasses, milking the pleasure for him. I wanted this moment to be burned in his mind forever.

"You are about to explode. Do you like this? Do you like it when I put my mouth on your cock?"

He nodded, desperate. "Yes, oh...it feels amazing." He looked down at me, his eyes hooded. "You're sure it's not gross for you?"

"No, Tre. I like it. I love your cock. It's so big. You taste so good in my mouth. And after you come, I'm going to show you some other things. I'm going to teach you how to make me feel as good as you do."

He nodded, and rolled his hips. I had his balls in one hand and I was massaging them gently, not touching his cock, letting him back away from the edge of orgasm. Now I took him in both hands, licking the tip, pumping up and down until he was grinding against me furiously. I took him in my mouth, slipped him in inch by inch, still moving my hands on him, sucking until he was against the back of my throat. I spat him out and sucked him back in slowly, and now he was groaning, arching his back, and his h*ps were rocking and I was matching his motion, and then he cried out and shot his seed into my throat, hot and salty and thick, not at all bitter, almost sweet.

I kept my hands on him, moving on his pulsing member to draw out his orgasm until he was locked in an arch. After a moment, I let go and moved up next to him, snuggling my head against his shoulder, rubbing his belly and stomach with my hand.

"Did you like that?"

He could only nod, and gasp. "Yes," he said, when had his breath back. "Oh my God, yes. I didn't know nothing could feel that way. It was like I was on fire and then I exploded, and...oh God."

I laughed. "Good. I'm glad."

"Shea? What happened to the...to what came out?"

I giggled against his shoulder. "Your sem*n? I swallowed it. It tasted good."

He didn't know what to say to that, so he didn't say anything.

Then: "Now what?"

I giggled again. "Oh Tre. You're cute, and so innocent. I'll change that." I pulled at his shoulder, rolling him toward me. "Now you touch me. Now you kiss me."

He moved for my lips, and I kissed him, then pushed him away. "No, Tre, I meant my body. I want to feel your lips on my body. All over."

He looked down at me. "Everywhere?"

I just nodded, biting my lower lip in anticipation of his mouth on me.

He lifted up on an elbow and his gaze raked down my body to my panties and the damp spot on them. I wanted him inside me, I wanted his c*ck to be hard again and to plunge into me, but I had to wait a few minutes more, at least. I took his free hand in mine and moved it to my br**sts.

"Everywhere. Touch me and kiss me at the same time. Take my tits in your mouth. Play with my n**ples. Do everything. Do anything. Touch me everywhere."

He didn't need any further encouragement. His fingers took my stiffened nipple in his and rolled it, pinched it, not too hard, then he slid his palm along my ribs to my hips, touched a tickling finger to my thighs and traced up to touch the triangle of the panties.

"Do you like my body, Tre?" I asked him.

I was asking as much because I wanted to hear the validation I'd needed for so long as to encourage him.

"Yes, Shea." He kissed his lips to my stomach, put his tongue to my nipple and licked me, suckled me. "I love your body. I'd imagined what a woman looked like nak*d, but you, you're like...I don't know how to put it. You're perfect."

He tugged on the panties, and I lifted my h*ps to let him draw them off. His eyes widened when he saw my shaved p**sy, wet with the juices of my desire. His fingers found my cleft and touched the line of my labia, then my clit. I gasped when his index finger touched my clit.

"Yes, yes, just like that. Put your fingers in my p**sy." I put my hands on his and pushed his fingers inside, helped him circle my wet, sensitive nub.

"You like it when I touch you like this?" he said.

"I like it as much as you like it when I touch your cock."

He suckled my tits and stroked my clit, bringing me up and up and up into a frenzy, moaning and gasping, bucking my h*ps as he fondled me. He followed my guiding, building me up and then slowing down, moving his finger in to find my G-spot and he rubbed it with a long finger, drawing a whimper from me. So close, I was so close, yes, and then I was there, fire blooming in my p**sy and spreading to my belly and sending ecstasy through me in a crescendo of waves.

I curled around him, clutched him, kissed him, tasting the musk of his come in my mouth still, tasting his salt on my lips, reveling in the hard planes and contours of his body. I shuddered against him, roaming his stomach and h*ps and ass with my hands, raking him with my fingers as aftershocks rumbled through me.

"Oh...Tre..." I breathed, "that was so wonderful, thank you."

He kissed me, caressed me everywhere his hands could reach. "No, no, Shea. Thank you...I never knew there could be feelings like that." He nipped my neck, tasting me, then pulled back and looked down at me. "Shea? What did it taste like? You really didn't mind putting my c*ck in your mouth?"

I smiled against him. "No, Tre. I liked it. I promise you I'm telling the truth. I liked being able to do that to you, showing you how good it could feel." I slipped my hand down his stomach to the hard V where his h*ps met his groin, felt him suck his belly in as I took his flaccid c*ck in my hands, rolling it, fondling the head in my fingers, rubbing him with my thumb and stroking him. Almost immediately I felt him grow hard, and I continued my ministrations, eager now to feel him inside me, to feel him fill me.

Oh Lord, I knew he would fill me so full, stretch me to accommodate him.

I pinched his n**ples, kissed them, nipped them with my teeth, cupped his sac with my hand, massaged his taint with my fingers and toyed with his now-rigid cock, until he was moist and throbbing in my hands.

He was ready, then, and I slid astride him, placing my palms on his chest and gazing down at him.

"Are you ready?" I asked him.

He nodded, took my h*ps in his hands and pulled me towards him, eager, still a little nervous. I leaned forward over him, crushing my br**sts against him and lifting my h*ps up. I guided him toward my folds, wetter than ever with anticipation and desire. His eyes were hooded and burning, and his breath was coming in long, deep gasps.

"Wait, Shea. Wait."

"What? You don't want to?" I started to move off him, not wanting to pressure him. "That's okay, we can wait-"

"No, I do want to. Just..."He touched my belly with a finger. "What if-what if you get pregnant?"

I kissed him, impressed by his consideration. "Tre, it's wonderful that you thought of that before we did it. Please don't ask any questions right now, but I can't have babies. I can't get pregnant. I'm healthy and fine and everything, I just can't conceive, okay? You don't need to worry. And I'm also clean...meaning I don't have any diseases you could catch."

Tre seemed shocked by that last consideration, then he shrugged and tugged at my hips. "Okay, then. If you're sure it's okay."

"It's more than okay," I said. "I can't wait any longer. I want you inside me, Tre."

I kissed him, flicking my tongue against his, guided him inside me, slow, so slow. He was big, bigger than I even realized, as I slid him into my p**sy, inch by inch by inch, gasping, panting, quivering my mouth against his, until he was buried into me to the hilt, h*ps grinding against hips. Tre was breathing hard already, fluttering his pelvis against mine, wanting to thrust.

"Slow, Tre...slow..."

I rocked my h*ps up, pulling him out so only his head was inside, and then lowered down again, impaling myself on him again, loving every slip of skin against skin.

"Oh, god, Tre," I breathed into his ear, "You feel so good inside me. You're so big...you fill me...oh god, yes, don't stop....just like that..."

Tre fell into the rhythm I was setting, long, slow strokes, his hands rubbing my back, my ass, my neck, brushing aside my hair to kiss my lips and my neck and my clavicle. I wanted to thrust down on him, hard and fast, but I held back, savoring every moment. His hands were strong and gentle, and his motions rhythmic and confident, more sure with every passing second, especially as I began to moan in pleasure.

I was never vocal, before him, but then I'd never felt anything like him, never been so filled, so satisfied by a man. I let myself go, after a while, let the rocking speed up, let my wet p**sy slap against his balls again and again and again, collapsing against his chest and just pumping my hips, crying out against his lips.

Then his orgasm began to rise and his voice joined mine, raised in ecstasy to fill the room with our merged cries of pleasure. Something told me he was holding back, though, something in the way he was carefully matching my rhythm, even as I could tell he was near coming.

"Don't hold back." I told him, meeting his eyes. "Please, don't hold back. I want it hard, now. Fast. Fuck me hard."

He actually gasped when I swore, and I laughed, not mocking him, but amused.

"Say that. Say it for me."

He let himself go, burying his face in my neck, putting his hands on my h*ps and pulling me down onto him as he railed into me, hard, hard, hard, furious now, no rhythm or restraint. It drove me even wilder.

"I love f**king you, Shea," he said, his voice a guttural rasp against my throat. "Don't stop, please don't stop."

"Never, never. Come with me, Tre," I said. "I'm so close, now, so close."

"I am too, I'm about to explode."

"Tell me you're gonna come inside me. Tell me you're gonna come deep inside my p**sy."

My words had the desired effect, driving him to a frenzy, grunting and heaving his breath against me, which only made me crazier as well, full of him, feeling his c*ck thrum against my cervix, pounding me, driving me into abandon.

Then he shuddered, paused, thrust hard into me, once-pause, gasping groan-twice, three times-"I'm coming, Shea...I'm...I'm coming deep inside your p**sy."

I couldn't speak then, driven to orgasm now myself, explosion after explosion rocking through me as he continued to drive into me, still coming, a flood of hot seed against my inner walls and even when his load was spent he kept plunging hard into me, wild thrusts split by a pause and his hands on my h*ps jerking me down onto him. I was sobbing into his pectoral, clawing his shoulders, fluttering my p**sy around his relaxing cock, softening and still pulsing inside me.

"Oh, God..." I whispered. "You are so good...so perfect inside me. That was amazing....so incredible."

Tre only panted, his hands supporting my limp weight on his body. "Am I...did I die and go to heaven?"

I laughed, long and open. "Yes, you did. I'm your personal sex-angel. I'm here to see that you feel that kind of pleasure forever."

"Oh, good." He was breathing normally, now, and I slipped him out of me and laid next to him. "Can we do that again? Soon?"

I nodded. "We can do that all the time. But there's so much else, so many other ways."

"Other ways?" His confused awe made me giggle again.

"Oh Lord, Tre. Yes, there's a million ways. You can be on top, or we can be on our sides, or I can put my legs over your shoulders, or standing up, or in the car..."

I played idly with his limp cock, amazed at how much it grew from this flaccid state into the glorious, perfect specimen of male anatomy it was when fully hard. I was lying partially on my side, and I rolled on to my belly next to him. I took his hand and moved it down to my ass, left it there and pushed my h*ps up.

"You can even put it in there, you know. You can touch me there, too. Just be slow and gentle. Dip your fingers in my p**sy and get them wet, first."

He hesitated. "In your butt?"

"Yes, in my a**hole. I won't let you hurt me. It will feel good."

He hesitated still, and I took his hand, dipped his fingers into my come-dripping folds and led them to my back door, pushed his index finger in, slowly, gently, carefully. Slowly, slowly, I guided him, moving his finger in and out, gasping into the pillow, watching him from the corner of my eyes, loving the marvel in his expression.

"You like it?" he asked.

"Yes...just like that..." I said. I took his dick in my hand, pumped him, fondled him.

I just couldn't get enough, couldn't be satisfier. After so long of nothing, just boredom and ridicule, Tre's sweet, ardent passion was exactly what I wanted.

All on his own, Tre leaned over me and slid his other hand between my legs, underneath his slowly-sliding finger and touched my p**sy again.

"Higher," I told him. "Touch my clit, near the top. Yeah, right there." He found the spot, circled it, massing my cl*t gently in circles.

He moved his hands at the same slow pace, matching their rhythm, increasing it when I started to pant and rock my h*ps again. He was growing hard yet again, and oh my sweet Lord the man was a machine, ready again so soon, and then I came, more convulsive explosions one after another, tightening my anus around his finger.

I pushed his hand away from my ass and rolled to my back. "Take me again, Tre, I want it so bad."

I pulled him on top of me, spread my legs and wrapped them high around his back, lifting my head up to watch him carefully slide his c*ck back inside me. He was being so gentle, so careful, so sweet. It made my heart clench and throb, and I had a fleeting fear mixed with equal parts hope that this tryst might become something else, something more.

There were no thoughts, then, just his huge c*ck inside me for the second time.

"Don't hold back. Take me all you want, take me as hard as you want. Don't be gentle. Just f**k me."

He rocked into me, rubbing my tits, flicking my n**ples, then kissing them and sucking my breast into his mouth as he moved inside me. I was still throbbing from my last orgasm, my third, and now with him inside me yet again, I felt it rising up, wetness pooling around him until we were both dripping, sloppy and messy and hot and moving together, my nails raking his back, my h*ps bucking against his.

He lost control, then, and I loved it. Loved it, so much. He was rocking into me, thrusting wildly, madly, grunting, slapping his balls into me, his fists planted to either side of my head, and then his weight pressed down on me and he was moving just his hips, slowing down, slowing, a pause with him pressed hard h*ps to hips, gasping, crying out loud against my tits.

"Oh, yes, hard, hard," I encouraged him.

He went hard again, plunging a slow, crashing thrust into me, once, twice, again, and I took over, screaming into his shoulder and my entire body was ripped into shreds of pleasure, an agony of ecstasy.

He collapsed on top of me, and we both passed out.

I woke up to a fist pounding on my door, and a deep voice calling out, "Mrs. Harley!"

Tre jerked awake. "That's my dad!"
