Chapter 1

Butterflies fluttered in Mallory's stomach as she slowed her car to a stop in front of the huge, intricately crafted wrought iron gates. She jumped slightly at a tapping on her window. A kindly-looking man in a security uniform motioned for her to roll it down.

"ID?" He asked in a routine manner.

"Um, yeah," Mallory fished her driver's license out of her purse and handed it to the man. "I'm with the catering company," she explained, somewhat unnecessarily; she was wearing a white button-down shirt with the Carly's Catering logo on it. The real guests at this party would be decked out in ball gowns and tuxes.

The guard checked her name off a list and handed back her ID. "Okay, Miss Williams, you can go on in," he gestured with a smile. The gates before her slowly eased open, admitting her to the exclusive estate. Even in the dimness of twilight, the grounds were impressive. The drive up to the old plantation house was lined with huge Live Oaks, hundreds of years old. Gray, lacy Spanish Moss dripped down from the elegantly curved branches that reached out over the road, creating a canopy of lush greenery that was illuminated by her headlights. Manicured lawns stretched out to either side, the gardens disappearing into the darkness.

Mallory wondered for a moment what it would be like to live here, to have a life like Jake Cleary's, heir to the Cleary fortune: beautiful homes all over the world; a multi-billion dollar company handed to you by your father; and more money than God. Hell, the guy probably hadn't worked a day in his life until his father died last year. And even now he probably just sat back and let the board of directors handle everything, throwing fancy parties at his leisure while other people looked after his fortune. He sure as hell had never had to steam lattes for pretentious ass**les to help pay his way through college like Mallory had.

I bet he's an entitled douchebag, she thought, assuring herself that a hard work ethic and gritty, real world experiences had gained her more character than he would ever have. Then she rounded a corner, and the Cleary mansion came into view, illuminated by warm yellow lights. A douchebag with a nice house, she admitted grudgingly.

The old plantation house was enormous, a sprawling white antebellum manor with dark blue shutters and a jutting, semi-circular porch supported by towering columns. Mallory had visited several plantations on the South Carolina coast, but this one surpassed them all.

She could see two men in white-tie finery, waiting to open the double doors for the first guests. But it was too early for that; no one would arrive for at least another hour. Only the servers would be here now, setting up. With a sigh, Mallory pulled her car around the back of the house, where the catering staff was supposed to enter through the back door.

More like the servant's entrance, she thought with asperity.

Mallory had been working in the service industry since she was sixteen, saving up money for college. She had nothing but respect for the people who worked hard to earn a living, but this was not what she wanted to do with her life. She had just graduated from the College of Charleston, with honors no less, but she had not been able to find employment in her dream field: Mallory wanted to teach. Thanks to government cut-backs, there weren't many positions to go around, so even though she had studied hard and ticked all the necessary boxes, she had found herself unemployed four months after graduation. Despite her years of careful scrimping and saving, money was running out, and rejection after rejection for employment was disheartening her.

So when her best friend Sally had cajoled her boss into offering Mallory a job with the catering company that she worked for, Mallory had jumped at the opportunity. Although she had never catered a private party, she had worked plenty of waitressing jobs; How different could this possibly be? Still, she couldn't help feeling a little nervous her first day on the job.

Swallowing back the butterflies, she turned the engraved brass doorknob on the back door and entered the mansion. She followed the signs left for the service staff and quickly found the kitchen. Although the house was at least three-hundred years old, the kitchen was sleek and modern. Dozens of people bustled around, calling orders to one another, their number filling the large space and making it feel cramped despite its size.

Mallory quickly pulled her long, straight brown hair back into a tight ponytail, tying it with a silky black ribbon, her one personal, feminine accent that she was allowed. Then she waded into the chaos, tying a crisp white apron over her black pencil skirt before entering the fray.

The next hour passed by in a haze of polishing, plating, and pouring. Mallory adroitly zipped around the kitchen, dodging and weaving as she completed her assigned tasks. Before she knew it, a tray of champagne flutes was being thrust into her hands as she was pushed out into the hall.

Mallory walked carefully down the corridor, anxious not to spill a drop of the precious fizzy liquid. As she progressed, she couldn't help admiring the family portraits that lined the walls, starting with the Cleary patriarch, dead for two generations now, and ending with none other than Jake Cleary, the current holder of the family fortune. Mallory paused at his portrait, undeniably taken in by Jake's good looks. He had his mother's deep blue eyes, a shade darker than Mallory's own, and he had inherited his father's strong, masculine jaw and midnight-black hair. The man could have made a personal fortune being a male model if he wanted to.

Mallory shook herself. Of course the painting was flattering; the artist had been paid to make the family look good. I bet in real life he has a lazy eye or something. No one should have good enough karma to be that attractive and that rich.

She continued her progress to the ballroom. When she arrived, there was a man in butler's livery waiting to open the door for her. As she stepped through the doorway and into the cheerily-lit room, she had to stop her jaw from dropping. She stood dumbly for a moment, overwhelmed. The room was massive, with a floor and walls of the same light-hued, polished wood. The wood panels on the walls were exquisitely carved with geometric patterns, the grooves creating bold shadows that stood in contrast to the smooth plains. Light from three crystal chandeliers reflected off the wood and filled the room with a warm, yellow light. Classical music swelled from the corner where the instrumental band was set up, and couples were waltzing elegantly in time on the dance floor.

The ballroom exuded opulence and refinement, as did the people that filled it. Men were dressed in sharply tailored tuxedoes, while the women were clad in gorgeous gowns, many of them slinky and jewel-toned, creating a riot of color that contrasted with the men's black-and-white garb.

Forcing her parted lips to close, Mallory approached the couple closest to her, discretely murmuring "Champagne?" as she neared them. They each took a glass without so much as a "thank-you" or even a glance in her direction. But Mallory was used to being an invisible, inconsequential cog in the service industry machine, so the behavior didn't bother her. Much.

She continued to make her way through the crowd, her tray rapidly emptying as she wound her way around the edges of the dance floor. Having made it halfway around the circuit, she was down to two glasses of champagne. She turned, deciding to head back to the kitchen for more. Only as she swung around, her tray came into contact with a very hard something. She watched in horror as it tilted, champagne flying out of the glasses before they tumbled to the floor, shattering on impact.

The tinkling sound seemed to echo throughout the room, drowning out the music. She could feel dozens of reproving gazes on her, making her cheeks flame red. Unable to look at anything but the floor in embarrassment, she dropped to her knees to gather up the shards of glass, reaching out with a thick cloth napkin to sweep it into a small, manageable pile.

But before her fingers brushed the floor, a strong, warm hand encircled her wrist, stopping her short. She looked up to find the last person in the world that she wanted to see crouching over her: Jake Cleary. The wind was knocked right out of her. He really was as handsome as his portrait made him out to be. Perhaps even more so. He had the same stunningly masculine features, but there was something about the energy around him that made him even more impressive. He seemed to radiate power, and Mallory found herself overwhelmed by it, caught in the intensity of his blue eyes. They were twinkling slyly, and his full lips were quirked up at the corners as though in amusement. Mallory would have been angered by his mocking expression, but she was too mortified to be affected by it.

"We don't want you cutting yourself, now do we?" He asked, a hint of a chuckle in his deep, rumbling voice. He straightened, standing, and his grip on her wrist pulled her up as well. Then she took in the full height of him; he must have been over six feet tall, dwarfing Mallory's five-foot-five-inch frame. As her eyes roved down his body, she saw that the front of his crisp white shirt was sopping wet.

The champagne! She had bumped into one of the richest men in the world and spilled his own champagne all over his fancy tux.

"Oh my god, I'm so sorry!" She squeaked, hastily pressing the linen napkin against his chest, trying vainly to absorb the liquid. As she did so, she couldn't help admiring the harness of his muscles, her touch inexorably lingering around the curves of his defined abs. Despite her situation, she licked her lips unconsciously as heat shot to her sex. She imagined what he looked like out of that tux...

His grip on her free hand brought her back to reality, and she blinked up at him in surprise. Her gaze locking with his, he stilled her efforts to dry his shirt. He was looking down at her, still smiling. But now there was something hard about his expression, a merciless glint in his eye. Mallory suppressed a shiver at the intensity of his demeanor, completely overwhelmed by him.

"That's quite enough of that," he said softly. Mallory's cheeks heated impossibly more, and she wrenched her hands free of his grip. He raised a long-fingered hand and snapped twice. A waiter appeared out of nowhere and immediately knelt to sweep up the shattered glass. Jake never even looked at him, instead keeping his eyes on Mallory. She had to stop herself from physically squirming under his scrutiny.

Imperious ass**le, she thought in some indignant corner of her mind. But mostly she was embarrassed, and undeniably turned on by her proximity to the sexy billionaire.

"Jake, what happened?" Came an angry female voice, jerking Mallory's attention back to the world around her. People were staring, many of them disapprovingly. But none so reproachfully as the woman who had wound her arm through Jake's. She was blond and pale-skinned, with striking green eyes and a statuesque figure. And she was glaring at Mallory as though she had intentionally thrown the champagne in her host's face.

Despite her predicament, Mallory couldn't help returning the snooty woman's glare. She might have just f**ked up big time, but she wasn't some sort of servant to be admonished by the high and mighty; this was the twenty-first century.

"It's fine, Celeste," Jake answered the blond coolly, never taking his eyes off Mallory. But the woman's arrival had broken whatever spell he had worked over Mallory, and she no longer felt trapped by his power. She just wanted to get out of there. Now.

Seizing the opportunity to flee, she mumbled a quick "sorry," in Jake's general direction and darted for the door.

Chapter 2

Tears were pricking at the corners of Mallory's eyes. I will not cry, I will not cry, she repeated the mantra in her head over and over again as her new boss- soon to be her old boss- yelled at her. She was being fired for the first time in her life, and it sucked. Mallory was not a confrontational person, and she had no tolerance for shouting. She would stand up for herself if someone was picking on her, but in this case she knew that she deserved the dressing-down she was getting. What kind of inexperienced idiot spilled drinks all over the host of the party that they were catering? Now the Clearys would probably never hire Carly's Catering again, and landing this job had been the best thing that had ever happened to the company.

Mallory felt like shit. Mumbling her earnest apologies, she agreed to help in the kitchen for free for the rest of the night and then return her uniform in the morning. She went about her tasks mechanically, putting herself on dish-washing duty as extra penance for her blundering. After several grueling hours of avoiding the staff's glares, the party was finally wrapping up, and Mallory prepared to leave.

She untied her apron, heading for the door, but she was stopped short by a tapping on her shoulder. Turning, she saw a man in butler's livery trying to catch her attention.

"Are you Mallory Williams?" He asked.

Mallory had a sinking feeling in her stomach as she nodded. "Mr. Cleary would like to speak with you," he said. Mallory's stomach outright dropped, like the ground had fallen away beneath her. She swallowed and forced a small, genial smile.

"Okay," she lied. "I just need to straighten up a few more things." She returned to the kitchen, fussing over drying a few dishes until the man left the room. Then she darted for the door. No way could she bring herself to face Jake Cleary. She had been yelled at enough for one evening, thank you very much; she didn't think she could take any more. Especially not from him. She thought of his powerful, intimidating demeanor and suppressed a shiver. No way was she going to face him.

Coward, she accused herself. But she didn't care. She had already been fired, so she didn't have to worry about making Carly look bad by not following her client's request. And she was definitely never going to see Jake Cleary again, so what did it matter if he got peeved that she slipped out?

It doesn't matter, she assured herself. Just get home and try to forget that this night ever happened. She climbed into her beaten-up old Carolla and shoved down the urge to tear out of the driveway, instead forcing her foot to only gently press the gas and drive at an appropriately slow speed. Within minutes, she had passed through the tunnel of Oak trees, and her headlights once again illuminated the closed wrought iron gates.

What? She thought. They screen people before they go out, too? What was this guy, some sort of paranoid control freak?

The security guard was at her window again, and she rolled it down with a sigh.

"Miss Williams?" He asked.

"Yes," she answered, surprised that he remembered her.

"Wait just a moment please, ma'am."

Mallory's brow furrowed, puzzled as the man pulled a walkie-talkie from his belt clip.

"Miss Williams is at the gate," he said into it.

There was a moment of static, then: "Tell her I want to speak to her." Even through the distortion of the radio, Mallory recognized the voice: Jake Cleary. She again felt that sinking feeling in her stomach.

The guard turned his attention back to Mallory. "Mr. Cleary would like to speak with you," he told her.

"Yes, I heard," she said, somewhat snappily. So what, he wasn't going to let her leave his property without him admonishing her for the stupid mistake she had made? I knew he was an ass**le. She was fuming.

The security guard was staring at her expectantly. "Fine!" She exclaimed, throwing up her hands in exasperated defeat.

"She's on her way, sir," she heard him say into the walkie-talkie as she rolled up her window. She made a three-point turn and drove back the way she had just come, muttering curses about elite snobs and their condescending douchebaggery. When the house was back in view, she parked her car- in the front lot this time- and headed for the non-servant's entrance. Seething, she boldly knocked on the door, letting some of her anger spill out as she rapped her knuckles on the wood with a sharp, satisfying sound.

She prepared a few choice words to hurl at Jake as the door opened, but she quickly swallowed them back as the butler came into view. Jeez, how many people does this guy keep on staff? How difficult could it possibly be to answer your own door?

But Jake wasn't the type to do anything mundane for himself, that much he had made clear. He couldn't even come talk to her on his own after the party; he had sent people to summon her to his presence. He totally was living in the wrong century if he thought this sort of behavior was acceptable. And Mallory was going to tell him just that.

The butler led her through a series of corridors and up a staircase before gesturing that she should enter one of the rooms. "In here, please, Miss Williams." As if she had a choice. Jake had practically trapped her, confined her to his property so that he could scold her like some child.

Bracing herself and clinging hard to her righteous anger, she stepped through the doorway and into a lavish study. The floor was covered by a deep red and blue Oriental rug, and the walls were lined with thousands of books. At the back of the room was a darkly polished mahogany desk, and behind it sat Jake Cleary. She again found herself momentarily stunned by how gorgeous he was: his sharp, masculine cheekbones, his bright blue eyes, and his hard body...

No! She reprimanded herself. He's not hot. Well, maybe he is physically, but his personality is a total turn-off. And that was precisely what she was going to tell him. He hadn't even stood up when she entered the room. Weren't Southern gentlemen supposed to do that? Instead, he sat far back in his chair, considering her. It made Mallory's skin crawl. Or was that a pleasurable shiver?

"Hello, Mallory," he said softly. Oh, so he was going to be one of those quietly angry, I'm-not-mad-I'm-just-disappointed types. Great. Well, Mallory would be damned if she let him get off the first shot.

"Mr. Cleary," she coated the formality in as much venom as she could. "I am sorry for what happened earlier," she began tersely, "but you do realize that this kind of behavior is not acceptable. Even though I'm just a servant, I do have rights. You can't keep me captive on your estate for as long as you like."

His lips twisted upward in a small smile. "Oh, can't I?" He asked smugly. Mallory was enraged by his haughtiness. Well, she told herself that she was. But rather than tensing with anger, she felt her knees go weak as he pinned her with a knowing stare. There was something... seductive about his arrogance, the way that he utterly commanded the space around him. He stood and circled around the desk, slowly advancing toward her, a predatory gleam in his eye. Mallory took an unconscious step backward, swallowing against the sudden dryness in her throat.

She struggled to gather her wits about her as he approached. "No, you can't," she said with less conviction than she would have liked. Struggling for a more normal tone, she insisted, "I won't stay here to be chastised by some entitled rich boy." There, she had said it. There was no taking it back now.

To her surprise, Jake just chuckled at her, his sly smile widening to show his perfect white teeth. God, he was even more breathtaking when he smiled like that. He was in front of her now, in her personal space. He bent his head forward until his lips were nearly touching hers. She couldn't move away; she felt frozen in place, captivated by him.

"Well aren't you just full of fire?" His voice was low and soft, his breath tickling her mouth, teasing her. He was so close that she could smell him: wood and musk and champagne. It was intoxicating; he was intoxicating. All thoughts of her anger left her, pushed aside by the intense need that suddenly filled her, making her ni**les harden against her bra and her pu**y clench. Unable to help herself, she tilted her head back slightly and closed her eyes, offering her lips to him.

His mouth descended on hers slowly, his lips gently caressing hers. Then his tongue was at her lips, demanding entrance. With a small sigh, she opened for him, and his tongue delved into her mouth, taking her thoroughly. Suddenly, he tore his lips from hers and shoved her shoulders hard. Her body hit the wall of books behind her, knocking some of them to the floor from the impact. And then Jake was on her, his strong body trapping hers. Heat rushed to her sex, and Mallory moaned wantonly as he roughly took her mouth once again.

No man had ever done this to her; her whole body was on fire for Jake, enflamed by his rough, passionate treatment. His large hand snaked into her shirt, reaching into her bra and cupping her breast. Mallory gasped at the intimate contact, her ni**les pebbling to hard buds. More. She needed more. Jake obliged her, his fingers closing around her nipple, pinching hard. Mallory let out a sharp cry as the pain turned to sweetest pleasure, making her sex throb.

Jake pulled away from the kiss as he continued to massage her breast. He regarded her, a slightly cold smile on his face, his eyes triumphant, pleased by her reactions to his skillful manipulation of her body.

"Man, am I glad I bumped into you," he said with a smirk.

Mallory's cheeks flushed, remembering her earlier embarrassment. "Sorry about that," she said, a bit breathily from their passionate kiss.

"Don't be." His expression was amused now. "It's not like it was an accident."

Wait, what? Was he saying what she thought he was saying?

"You mean..." She began hesitantly, not wanting to accuse him of anything. "You knocked into me on purpose?"

Jake grinned. "Of course," he said, as though it were the most obvious thing in the world.

Mallory felt like a bucket of cold water had been dumped over her head, dousing the heat that she felt for Jake. She shoved him off of her as her anger boiled back to the fore, strong and unrelenting. Well, she shoved at his chest, but he didn't move an inch. When she spoke, her voice was tight with the effort of keeping herself from shouting. "Why? Why on earth would you do that?" Because he's a rich, sadistic ass**le who gets off on watching the underlings squirm, the more cynical side of her answered.

"Because I wanted you," he said simply, as though he thought it a perfectly rational explanation for his behavior. Almost as if he thought it was a compliment.

Mallory was seething, her hands clenching into fists. "So you got me fired just so that you could bring me here after your soiree and have sex with me?!" Her voice was shrill, incredulity coloring her tone.

Jake frowned and stepped back from her, releasing her. "I didn't mean to get you fired," he said.

"Oh, well that makes it all better," she snapped. "God, do you ever think of anything but yourself? Some of us have these things called 'jobs,' you know. We kind of need them to earn a living." She sidestepped away from him, anxious to put as much distance between herself and the sexy snake as possible.

Jake looked troubled. "Mallory, wait," he began, reaching out for her. She ripped her arm away from his grasp.

She eyed him levelly. "I'm leaving now," she said coldly. "And if you don't open your fancy gate for me, I will drive my car right through it." Without waiting for him to answer, she turned on her heel and stormed out of his gorgeous mansion.

Chapter 3

Mallory didn't wake up until noon the next day to make up for her late night. It had been almost three A.M. when she left Jake's, and she hadn't been able to fall asleep until the beginnings of dawn's rays were peeking through her curtains; she had been too incensed to sleep. She simply could not believe what Jake had done to her. Not only had he gotten her fired, but he had tried to seduce her with only a few words, like she was some floozy who was just going to flop down on his desk and let him take her.

And that was nearly what had happened, which just made her even angrier with herself. She had never felt that sort of passionate heat with any man, and she most certainly had never had a one-night stand. Mallory enjoyed sex, but she was far from a nymphomaniac. There had been a couple of boyfriends in college, but none of her couplings with them even began to measure up to her few steamy minutes in Jake's study.

She couldn't blame herself entirely; the man was so hot it was practically sinful. And although she resented him for his high-handed treatment of her, she couldn't deny that his confidence was a major turn-on.

But now she was padding around her modest apartment glumly, automatically showering and getting ready for the day, despite having nothing on her agenda. With no job to go to and no more teaching positions to apply for, there were few activities to fill her day. She felt like she was stagnating, being lazy. And she despised laziness. She supposed she could go to the mall today and see if any of the shops were hiring. Retail might be better than serving.

Suddenly, there was an unexpected knock at her door. Maybe it was Sally, here to collect her uniform to return to the caterers. With a sigh, Mallory opened the door. And then she closed it again immediately when she saw who was on the other side. Only it wouldn't close; the toe of an expensive leather shoe was blocking it. She wrenched the door back open with a frustrated growl.

"What do you want?" She snapped at Jake. "And how did you know where to find me?"

Jake's lips quirked up into a crooked smile, as though he couldn't help finding her anger amusing. "Well, firstly, I came here to ask you out on a date. And secondly, I called the caterers and they gave me your home address."

Mallory gaped at him. He thought she was going to go out with him after what he had done? And after revealing that second little nugget of information? "Isn't that against the law or something for them to give out my personal details?"

His smile turned sly. "I can be very persuasive."

Mallory hated him in that moment. He was far too conceited, too smug about his own power and charm. "Well, there is no way I'm going out with you, so you can leave now," she said coldly.

But that charming smile stayed firmly in place, his eyes twinkling. "Are you sure? I know the best little authentic Italian restaurant."

"I don't know what you're not getting here," she snapped, exasperated. "I said, no. Unequivocally no."

His face fell, but there was something so dramatic about his expression that she knew he was being disingenuous. "Well, at least let me apologize for getting you fired. Can I come in and we can talk?"

She stared at him flatly. "No."

Then something in his eyes softened, the lines around his mouth betraying true anxiety. It was the first trace of true vulnerability that he had exhibited. It clearly did bother him that he had lost her her job. "Please?" He asked humbly.

Moved by his display of contrition, she stepped aside so that he could enter. "Okay," she said, somewhat reluctantly. "You can come in."

A grin lit up his face. "Excellent." There was a glint in his eye as he stepped over the threshold, a glint that Mallory didn't trust at all. She was already beginning to regret letting him in. Nonetheless, her parents had raised her to be a polite hostess, so she led him into her modest living room and sat down on her couch.

"You can sit wherever you want," she said, but she gestured to the armchair opposite her.

Disregarding her indication, Jake sat down on the couch directly beside her, so close that she could smell his heady, masculine scent. She had to restrain herself from leaning into him and breathing him in. God, he really was sexy. Now that he was so close, she could see that his eyes had taken on a greenish hue, turning them an almost aqua color. He took both of her hands in his, and heat flared between them. Discomfited by her intense reaction to his proximity, Mallory tried to tug her hands away, but he held them fast. She couldn't deny that the feeling of being captured by him was arousing; her breathing hitched and her sex throbbed. A small, knowing smile played around Jake's lips. She had to restrain herself from squirming under his amused scrutiny.

Mallory forced herself to gather her wits about her, struggling to put up walls against his relentless seductive onslaught. "So," she began, a bit shakily, "I think you were going to apologize?"

"Oh yes," he said, that same hint of anxiety returning to his expression. "I don't do this often, but here goes: Mallory Williams," he speared her with his blue-green gaze, "I am truly sorry for the grief I so callously caused you. I promise to do everything I can to make it up to you. Will you please forgive me?"

Although his apology was flowery and clearly rehearsed, it was genuine. Mallory found that she was moved by this softer side of him, like she was seeing the man under the usually-cocky mask.

"Yes," she heard herself whisper, "I forgive you."

The lines of worry around his eyes eased, and his face fell into his relaxed, conceited smile once again. The sincere man might have disappeared behind the arrogant mask, but it sure was a sexy mask. Mallory couldn't help licking her lips as she felt the power radiating off of him, enveloping her. Jake leaned into her, and she found herself moving unconsciously to meet him. But she stopped herself at the last minute, pulling back slightly.

"What are you doing?" She asked weakly, although she had a pretty good idea of what was going to happen.

"Making it up to you," he breathed, his voice low and seductive. And then his lips were on hers. There was no gentleness this time, only a rough, fierce plundering of her mouth. Then his hands were at the hem of her dress, tugging it upwards. Mallory compliantly lifted herself slightly off the couch so that he could pull it over her head. He sat back for a moment, admiring her. She shivered as he traced a gentle finger along the top edge of her lacy pink bra, and her nerve endings there jumped to life. As though he couldn't hold himself back any longer, he swiftly reached around behind her and snapped open the clasp on her bra in one fluid movement. Mallory shrugged out of it, leaving herself completely bare to him except for her lacy pink panties.

"God, you're sexy, Mallory," he said, the hint of a growl in his gravelly tone. His strong fingers tangled in her hair at the base of her scalp, grasping a handful of it and sharply tugging her head back. He again took her lips with his, his tongue thrusting against hers. The sensation made her sex swell and throb, her cl*t aching to be touched.

At the same time, she was desperate to touch him, to feel his hard muscles. Her fingers fumbled blindly at his shirt buttons, somehow managing to get them all undone. She pressed the fabric back off his shoulders and down his upper arms, caressing his corded muscles as she did so. She couldn't suppress a shiver as she felt overwhelmed by his masculinity, by his powerful physique; he could do anything he wanted to her, and there would be nothing she could do to stop it. Taking his hands from her body, Jake finished pulling off his shirt. Mallory took a moment to marvel at him, tracing her fingernails gently down his well-defined abs, lingering at the trail of dark hair that disappeared into his trousers.

Jake hissed in a breath as she touched him, tugging at the hair there. He unbuckled his belt and pulled it from his belt loops. There was a soft, rustling sound as the leather brushed against the sleek material of his pants. Mallory shivered delightedly at the sound, anticipating that he would unbutton his pants next, revealing his hard c**k that she so desperately wanted. But instead he grabbed her slender wrists in one large hand, pressing them together with her palms facing one another. With his other hand, he looped the belt over them, pulling the tongue through the buckle until her wrists were trapped. He then wrapped the length of it around and around, until he finally tucked the end of it into the cuff that he had created.

Mallory started at her wrists, wide-eyed. She tugged at the belt, but there was no give; she couldn't possibly free her hands. She had never played a game like this, but the rush of heat to her pu**y told her that she liked it. There was a niggling fear at the back of her mind as she realized her vulnerable position, but that only turned her on more. Her panties were soaked with her wetness.

Jake pressed a firm hand to her shoulder, pushing her down onto the couch. He then pulled her legs along the length of it so that she was lying on her back. Grabbing her bound hands, he roughly shoved them over her head and held them there, completely stretching her out before him. His eyes roved up and down her body appreciatively until they came to rest on her face once again. He speared her with his intense gaze, which was a deep blue now.

"Keep your hands there," he commanded her sternly.

She swallowed and nodded faintly, aware that she was leaving herself completely at his mercy, but unable to deny him.

Then his mouth was at her throat, his hot breath making the sensitive skin there tingle. She could feel his firm tongue lick up the side of her neck to her ear, making her moan at the erotic tingles that it sent dancing through her body. He paused for a moment, and then his teeth closed gently on her earlobe, tugging at it as he teased it with his tongue. Mallory gasped at the sensation as her eyes rolled back in her head blissfully.

And then he was leaving a trail of soft kisses down her neck and onto her chest. He stopped when he reached her br**sts, running gentle fingers around them, circling, making her ni**les harden to stiff peaks. Bending down, he pursed his lips and blew a stream of cool air directly onto her right breast, teasing her.

"Will you go out with me, Mallory?" He asked, holding her on the precipice.

What? He was asking her out on a date? Now?

"What?" She asked aloud, breathless. He just shook his head, smiling, and did the same to her left breast, making her nerve endings jump to life. She was nearly quivering with need now. But he did not touch her ni**les as she so desperately wanted. Instead, he touched his tongue to her sternum, trailing its warmth downward until he reached the top of her sex. He hovered there for a moment.

"Will you come out with me?" He asked again.

But Mallory was too frustrated to listen. She tugged at her hands, trying to free them so that she could touch herself. "Touch me, Jake," she whined. "Please." Her sex was throbbing painfully, her need more intense than it had ever been in her life. But Jake just lowered his head further, planting soft kisses along her thighs around her pu**y, never touching her where she craved.

"Come out with me, Mallory," he commanded this time, murmuring against her sensitive skin.

"Yes," she caved, giving him what he wanted. "Please, Jake!"

She saw a flash of his white teeth as he grinned, triumphant. Then his mouth was on her clit, sucking the hard bud into his mouth, his teeth grazing against it.

Mallory exploded, her pu**y contracting as her orgasm rippled through her, making heat flash over her skin, her entire body quivering.

As she came down off her high, Jake pushed himself up off of her, reaching for her bound hands. He tenderly unwrapped the belt, freeing her and massaging her wrists where the leather had bitten into them as she struggled. He pulled her up into a sitting position, resting her back against his hard chest, holding her against him with a strong arm around her waist. Mallory relaxed into him, sighing contentedly.

She reached out to touch him and could feel his impressive length though his pants, hard and ready for her. "Is there anything I can do for you?" She asked throatily.

He hesitated for a moment. "As much as I would like to, we don't have time. I'll be sure to take you up on the offer soon though." She could practically hear him smirking. "But for now, we have to get going."

She craned her head back and looked at him quizzically. "Going? Going where?"

"On our date," he said, matter-of-factly.

"Now?" She asked, surprised. "What's the rush?"

He smiled at her slyly. "It's a bit far away, and I don't want us to miss our reservation."

"Where are we going?" Mallory asked, curious.

"Venice," Jake replied with a grin. "You should probably pack a bag."

The End...
