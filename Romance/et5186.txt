ONE

Slowly rising out of the fog of a deep sleep, I felt Max's hand on my shoulder.

"Do you need a Lortab?" he whispered into my ear.

I was lying on my right side, with Max spooning me. This is how we had been sleeping for the last couple of weeks. It was Max's idea to keep me from rolling onto my left side where the broken rib was.

My eyes were slowly opening, focusing on the bedside table and the clock that read 5:42 a.m. "No, I'll be okay."

"You were groaning," he said. "Does it hurt?"

"Not too bad."

Max nuzzled his face into the crook of my neck, planting a soft kiss just below my ear. I nestled closer to him, as much as I could without irritating my damaged yet slowly healing rib. His warm naked body enveloped mine, contrasting with the cool sheets. Despite the little stab of pain I felt as we shifted on the bed, I couldn't imagine a more comfortable place to be.

Or a safer one.

Max's breathing grew slow and regular, and I knew he had gone back to sleep. I, however, probably wasn't going to be able to.

I had indeed groaned in my sleep, but only somewhat from the rib pain. According to the doctors, I still had a few weeks to go until the pain would subside, and every once in a while I'd feel a quick, sharp, shooting pain in the area. If I were awake, it would make me reflexively inhale quickly. When asleep, it would sometimes wake me, but other times it would trigger a dream.

This night, I had been dreaming about the attack, the fourth such nightmare in the last couple of weeks.

They were just dreams. Nothing more. Chris had been locked up and had denied bail because he lived in Ohio and authorities in Los Angeles argued that he was a flight risk. The case was already over. There was no trial, thanks to Chris accepting a plea deal. I wasn't all that happy about it, but I didn't really have a choice. On the good side, though, it saved both Krystal and me from having to testify and face that monster once more.

More than once, Max had expressed guilt over the fact that he hadn't been there that night to protect me from Chris. He'd been on his way over, but hadn't arrived in time.

I brushed off his guilt, telling him not to think about it. What was done was done, and Chris would no longer be a threat to me. Each time, Max dropped the subject.

Not wanting to add to his guilt, I kept the dreams from him.

.........<br/>

I had only rarely gotten a good look in the backyard. Before moving in with Max, our time at his house had been spent mostly inside, and even being here full-time, I hadn't felt like going outside much. I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway, thanks to the painkillers I had been taking.

"No one can see us, right?" I asked.

Max took my hand and we walked to the edge of the pool. "The houses aren't close enough."

"What about from down there?" I indicated the beach by holding out my hand with the glass in it.

"Relax, Olivia." He turned to face me, bent his neck and kissed me on the lips. "Let's enjoy the morning."

"It seems like you already are," I said, looking down and seeing his growing erection between us.

He shook his head slowly. "You drive me fucking wild. Now, get in here with me."

I followed him down the four steps into the pool. The water was brisk, almost too much so. "Guess this is as good as a cold shower." I placed the glass on the edge of the pool.

Max held me in his arms as I wrapped my legs around his waist. He was kissing me lovingly, not lustfully, something he sometimes did but usually when we were just lying around together. Never when he was revved up, totally hard, ready to go, just like he was at that moment.

I didn't say anything. I let myself enjoy his soft, perfect kisses.

After moving his lips to my neck, he kissed me on my shoulder, then rested his head there.

"What's the matter?" I asked.

He took a deep breath and released it, creating a few bubbles where the waterline met my shoulder.

I had my hand on the back of his head and I gently closed my fingers around a handful of hair and pulled his head back, looking into his sad eyes.

"What is it? Talk to me, Max."

"I should have been there."

"Where?"

He rolled his head to the side and looked past me out at the Pacific. "You know where. I can't let it go."

While I had been recovering physically and mentally from the attack, apparently Max was having an even more difficult time getting over his emotional scars from that night.

For my part, the physical recuperation was more difficult than the psychological one. Chris had been tormenting my mind for a long time before the night he showed up at my apartment to do...whatever it was he was going to do to me, after kidnapping my roommate Krystal.

I suppose the fact that I fought him off myself - pretty damn harshly, I might add - went a long way toward healing the mental scars he had left on me for quite a while. I had found a side of myself that I had no idea was there. An aspect of me that I had no reason to tap into until that terrible night.

I had protected myself. All on my own. My story not only surprised me, it impressed the detectives who were working the case. All of this combined to give me a sense of closure when it came to Chris.

Well, that and the fact that he had taken a plea deal and would be spending a great portion of the rest of his life in prison. Some of his time was the result of his breaking-and-entering into our apartment. Some of it was from his assault on me. But most of it was due to the aggravated charges he faced because of the way he injured Krystal and placed her in the trunk of his car. The fact that she sustained serious bodily harm that potentially threatened her life depending on how long she was left in there was the basis for the felony charge.

Anyway, the dreams were still there, but I knew I had already come a long way from that awful night to reclaiming my real self, and someday, probably sooner rather than later, the nightmares would be as much a part of the past as Chris himself was.

"Like I said in the hospital that night, you're not Batman." I smiled, trying to elicit one in return, but got nothing.

"It could have been so much worse."

I kissed him on his forehead. "You have to let this go. I'm fine. I really am. He's gone for a long, long time and I'm doing so much better. I handled it myself. And look where it got me. I'm here in this amazing place, with an amazing man. What more could I ask for?"

I leaned into him and kissed him, hard, to keep him from saying anything more.

TWO

Six weeks later, I was feeling much better and had been working at Max's film production company, an independent venture he had decided to rekindle over the last several weeks.

He no longer wanted to enter into development deals with the studios. The freedom associated with independently producing and distributing his own movies was something he had wanted for a while now. Back when he confessed to me that all he wanted to do was write, what he really wanted was independence from corporate filmmaking.

A development deal meant producing scripts that fulfilled the wishes of a focus group rather than Max's own creative whims. He was established enough to tell the studios he was going independent and if they liked what he was doing they could discuss a price.

So, six weeks after moving in with him, I was settling into an office down the hall from Max's.

The company was in Century City, a little more than halfway between Malibu and L.A., about thirty minutes from our house. It was a one-story brick building, and the walls inside were also brick, with thick oak rafters and wood floors in the open space. Max had decorated the place with movie posters - not just the ones he'd worked on, but some of his favorite movies as well - giving it a real studio feel, even though he was glad to get away from the confined nature of that part of the business.

There were four full-time employees whose responsibilities ranged from finance to talent acquisition to procurement of equipment to travel for location scouting and all other travel needs. Max had hired them away from the studio, grabbing the best people on his way out.

I was Max's manager, which meant I pretty much ran the place, doing everything Max couldn't do himself and didn't want to hand off to just anyone. There was a definite learning curve, and Max, true to form, was a magnificent teacher.

My job was far different than that of an agent, so I wasn't replacing Lyle Ridge, who had been Max's agent for years. Lyle had a huge client list, but always took Max's call or mine in a timely fashion. He was a soft-spoken man, and way more easy-going than any agent I'd ever been around, but he was sharp and had connections to everyone in town.

Max came into my office one day and said, "Let's talk about money."

I was sitting in my black leather chair behind the glass and chrome desk. Max sat down in one of the visitor's chair, smiling.

"Money...as in the budget for the new film?"

He shook his head. "Your money. Your salary."

We had touched on the topic previously, but hadn't settled the issue.

"I've made up my mind, and since I'm the boss, you have to accept whatever I offer you or you are of course free to resign."

I pushed my chair back and put my feet up on the desk, crossing my legs. "Shoot."

"You're distracting me," he said. "Such a tease."

His eyes started their journey at my bare feet and traveled up my legs. I was wearing a black pencil skirt and a caramel tank. I had slipped out of my heels shortly before he walked in.

"Me?" I said, feigning ignorance. "When do I ever tease you?"

"Just by being alive, you tease me. So how about you put those pretty legs down and let's get on with business."

"Yes, sir," I said, swinging my legs back under the desk and slipping my feet back into my shoes.

"I'll get right to the point. I'm going to pay you exactly what I pay myself," he said. "That way, if you decide to leave, you won't be a financial hostage to me."

I sat there surprised. "I'm not going anywhere. Why - "

"I don't think you're going anywhere, Liv, but if you do...well, you can. I need to know that you're staying with me because you want to, not because you have to."

I stood and walked around my desk over to Max, sat on is lap, put my arms around his neck, and kissed his forehead.

As gently as I could, I said, "Honestly, it feels like some kind of test. A while back you told me you felt like so many people wanted to be close to you because they could get something from you. And maybe that's the case. But you told me I was nothing like that."

He shook his head. "You're not, and I know that. Just trust my reasoning. And, by the way...I'm not testing you, I'm making you rich."

I did trust Max's reasoning. I trusted everything about him. Completely. And the rich thing sounded pretty damn good.

He looked at me intensely, reached up and put his hand on the side of my face, pulling my head down, and he sealed his lips around mine.

.........<br/>

Paula Dalton lived in Thousand Oaks, about 30 minutes away from our house. Max drove us in his BMW X5 SUV, opting for that instead of his Porsche, saying, "I don't drive this as fast and I want you to see the scenery."

It was a gorgeous sunny day, and we had the top down. I had to hold my hair in place as the Pacific breeze whipped through it. We didn't talk, but instead listened to the songs on my iPhone as we rode up.

Max's mother lived in a one-story ranch home. The lawn was perfectly manicured, and I made a comment to Max about it as we pulled into the driveway.

"Don't get out just yet," he said, looking over at me as he put the car in Park.

I thought he meant that he was going to open my door for me, but just as I was about to ask why, the answer was provided by the yelping of two white West Highland Terriers who were circling the car, checking it out, and barking a warning to their owner.

"They have free run of the place," Max said, "but they have those electronic fence collars."

He got out and the two dogs gathered at his feet. I opened the door and before my shoe hit the driveway, the little guys had lost all interest in Max and greeted me, the newcomer, instead.

I knelt down to pet them.

Max came around to my side of the car and said, "Meet Zeke and Dolly. Don't ask me which is which."

Just then I heard his mother's voice. "Max, you can tell them apart by their collars."

"The way they move so fast, it's hard to tell."

I looked up and saw Max hug his mom and kiss her on the cheek.

I stood from my crouching position, as the dogs yelped their disapproval of not having my full attention anymore.

Max's mother was in her late fifties, but didn't look it. The old pictures Max had showed me led me to believe she just might answer her door wearing an apron, with her hair up in a bun, and sporting glasses with a beaded chain. I guess maybe I was expecting someone who looked more like Alice the housekeeper from The Brady Bunch than a woman who looked like she could have been a character actress who stepped off the set of a soap opera.

She had blonde hair, deep blue eyes, and perfectly straight, white teeth. She was in as good a shape as any fifty-something-year-old woman I had ever seen.

She took a step toward me and opened her arms to hug me. "Olivia, it's so nice to finally meet you."

We hugged and I said, "You, too, Mrs. Dalton."

"Call me Paula, I insist."

She kept her hands on my shoulder as she pulled back to look at Max, then back at me. "He's so secretive, I thought I'd never get to meet you."

"I told you about Olivia months ago," Max said.

"Well, when you're this serious about a lady, you shouldn't hide her from your mother."

That's when she looked at me, saying, "Don't ever think you have to get his permission to visit me," and then immediately asked if I wanted a "pop." Ah, yes. "Pop." Despite her newfound California style, Paula Dalton was still a Midwesterner at heart.

We spent a good portion of that Sunday afternoon at his mother's house, eating roasted chicken with carrots and green beans and big helpings of rice. Paula, in true mom mode, showed me pictures of Max as a child, mostly school pictures, but also some from holidays. My favorite was one of him when he was seven years old, lying next to the Christmas tree, surrounded by wrapping paper. Paula said she had snapped that photo in the mid-afternoon, when Max had fallen asleep, exhausted from playing with his new toys for hours on end.

As she flipped through the pages of the photo album, I noticed that there were no pictures of his father. On the way home, I wanted to ask him about that, but decided not to. It was obvious why his mother had purged the albums of pictures of his father. And it wasn't worth bringing up because the scars his father left on his life - and on his mother's life - were of the kind that probably never fully healed, and I erred on the side of caution and let it go.

.........<br/>

I splashed some water on my body. Max watched it trickle down from my neck, over my breasts, and I looked down and saw a bead of water clinging to my right nipple.

I'm a firm believer that men should take care of themselves down there, just as they expect women to. I'd always liked the closely trimmed look and feel, but when I suggested to Max one day that we give it a try with both of us completely shaved, we loved it and were sticking with it for now.

There's something completely different and sensual about the feeling of pure, soft, smooth skin-on-skin action. Or tongue-on-skin, for that matter.

"Here," he said, holding the razor out to me. "I've shaved you before. Now it's your turn."

My eyes shot open. I hadn't been expecting that in the least. "Serious."

"Serious," he said. "Go slow."

I took the razor and settled in closer to him.

I started above his cock, letting the blade glide across his taught muscle slowly. He had been keeping up the grooming, so there wasn't much to shave, but I was still taking my time with this unexpected thrill.

The trust it took for him to allow me to do this was even more of a rush.

With my left hand, I held his length, now growing erect, as I lightly dragged the blade around his balls.

Max got harder the longer this went on, his erection jutting out. At one point, I moved my face closer to him, sticking my tongue out and licking a little droplet of precome from the head.

"Dammit, Olivia, I can't take this much longer."

"What? Me holding this sharp object so close to your balls?"

He didn't laugh, didn't even smile at my joke. "No. Being this close to your mouth."

I was finished shaving him, so I placed the razor in the holder on the wall, then filled my cupped hands with water and rinsed him off, removing what was left of the shaving cream. I did this three or four times, completely cleaning him...

And then I took the head of his cock between my lips, massaging it like that, running my tongue over the slit, driving him even more to the edge.

Max moved his hips forward a little, sliding more of his cock into my mouth. I opened wide and took as much of it as I could, closing my lips around him.

He ran his hand though my hair, gathering it in a bunch and holding it at the back of my head - not forceful, but guiding the action.

I felt him throb. He wasn't about to come. He was flexing the muscle beneath his balls to make that happen. It was a sensation that he had created before, and I had told him how much I loved to feel it, both in my mouth and when he was inside me. He didn't always do it, preferring instead to surprise me with it.

And he did, just then. I smiled around his cock.

"Bed." That's all he said. One word. That was a rare thing with Max, but when he did so, I felt a surge of unique excitement at his blunt command.

He stood, taking me by the hand as I stepped out of the tub, and he pulled me along to the bed, where he spun me around and I landed on my back. We hadn't bothered to dry me off, so I was still damp from the waist down from sitting in the bathwater.

But, at a moment like this, who could possibly care?

Max's head was between my legs in a flash, his face buried in my sex - his nose pressing on my clit as his tongue greedily lapped, then entered me.

He grabbed my ankles and moved my feet closer to my hips, bending my knees in the process, allowing me to lift my lower body off the bed. I bucked my hips as he fucked me with his tongue in hungry, excited, but feathery soft wet strokes.

I reached down and took a handful of his hair in my fist. I loved feeling how his head made a circular motion as his tongue massaged my clit.

I moved my hips up and down, faster against his face, and felt the first wave of orgasm ripple through me.

"Come in my mouth," Max managed to say, his words intensifying the nerve-tingling rush he had brought me to.

He kept his tongue on my clit until the sensation was too great, and I pushed his head away. He rose on the bed, positioning himself between my legs. I felt the weight of his erection against my sex.

Max's mouth went right for my breasts, first sucking on my left nipple, then my right, alternating between the two. He moved his hips, rubbing the plump crown of his penis against me. His tongue licked and flicked across my nipples, until finally he took one between his tongue and his upper teeth, a feeling I loved so much it made me arch my back involuntarily.

"Offense or defense?" he breathed.

It was a running joke between us - who would be on top to start? Offense was top, defense was bottom.

"Is it my turn to choose?" I asked. "Because right now I don't care - "

And just like that, having given him the faintest green light, he plunged the tip of his cock into me, then stopped. He slipped it out a little, then pushed back in.

"I love teasing you," he said.

"You love trying to make me beg for it."

Max didn't say anything. He just kept up that taunting motion.

This too was part of the offense-defense thing we had - seeing who could hold out the longest.

I usually won this part of the battle, because Max always made me come before sex. Sometimes with his mouth, other times with his hand, and sometimes he even did it in this position using just the teasing glide of his rigid length across my wet folds.

Today, though, Max was going to win. After letting me shave him, and after that sheet-clawing orgasm he'd just given me, I wanted him inside me.

"Fuck me," I said, reached out and putting my hand on his clenched ass, pulling him into me.

He slid in with one smooth thrust.

His head dipped and his lips sealed around mine. He groaned low in his throat as he drove his cock into me to the hilt. I threw my head back and his mouth went right for my throat.

Max then got up on his knees, placing his hand under me on the small of my back, lifting me slightly. It gave him a different angle of entry and he fucked me deep and hard until I felt his cock throbbing - not the kind he controlled, but the kind I always felt as his body geared up for orgasm.

I reached up and placed my palm flat on his stomach. I loved feeling the way his muscles contracted as he moved in and out of me.

The need. The desire. The power. Everything about his intense maleness while he fucked me sent my nearly helpless body right to the edge of orgasm again.

As I clenched around him, his own throbbing increased. I felt the first hot spurt of his come jetting out of his cock, then more, more, our skin-on-skin becoming warmer and slick, until we were both spent.

THREE

One of the many perks of living with Max was that I no longer dreaded getting up in the mornings. I liked my sleep, always had, and the sound of an alarm clock was something I'd always hated. But now, being shaken out of slumber by that awful sound was becoming a less frequent occurrence.

Max liked to wake me up in other ways. Sometimes it was his hands caressing my back or my legs. I always slept with my back to him, snug in his embrace. So sometimes I woke up to the feeling of him circling a finger around my nipple as he pressed and rubbed himself along my bottom.

But my favorite - and apparently one of Max's - was the mornings I'd wake up on my back, legs spread, with Max's head between my legs. He would always have pushed the comforter and the top sheet off the bed to the floor, and it was just the two of us naked there on the bed.

"Good morning," he would always say, stopping for a few seconds when I looked down my body and made eye contact with him.

But there was a morning, just a few short weeks after he renamed the company, a Monday morning when we were about to hire a casting director for Max's new film, that I woke up as Max was turning me over onto my stomach.

"Good morning, dream girl," he whispered into my ear.

I smiled in response, as I turned my head to the side and rested it on my folded arms.

Max moved my hair to the side and kissed the back of my neck. He was sort of hovering over me and I could feel his hard cock against the back of my thigh, then along the cleft of my ass, as he moved back and forth slowly, enjoying the soft friction.

Soft for him, anyway. For me, it was different. "You're rough," I said, sleepily, referring to the fact that he hadn't shaved in a few days.

I lay still in that position, not getting a response from Max. Or maybe he did say something and I just didn't hear it, because the next thing I knew I was waking up again, and about five minutes had passed.

I heard water running in the bathroom, so I got up and padded across the carpet to find Max in there, sitting on the edge of the tub, with his back to the door.

"I'm sorry I fell asleep on you," I said.

"No worries, Liv. You were right. I was kind of rough."

I walked over and sat beside him.

"I don't know why I've never seen you do this before," I said.

He turned his attention away from what he was doing, looked at me, smiled and said, "Me neither."

The tub was filling up with water, and I was already naked, so I got in. I sat cross-legged in front of Max as he remained on the edge of the tub.

His groin was lathered up with shaving cream and he held a razor in one hand.

I splashed some water on my body. Max watched it trickle down from my neck, over my breasts, and I looked down and saw a bead of water clinging to my right nipple.

I'm a firm believer that men should take care of themselves down there, just as they expect women to. I'd always liked the closely trimmed look and feel, but when I suggested to Max one day that we give it a try with both of us completely shaved, we loved it and were sticking with it for now.

There's something completely different and sensual about the feeling of pure, soft, smooth skin-on-skin action. Or tongue-on-skin, for that matter.

"Here," he said, holding the razor out to me. "I've shaved you before. Now it's your turn."

My eyes shot open. I hadn't been expecting that in the least. "Serious."

"Serious," he said. "Go slow."

I took the razor and settled in closer to him.

I started above his cock, letting the blade glide across his taught muscle slowly. He had been keeping up the grooming, so there wasn't much to shave, but I was still taking my time with this unexpected thrill.

The trust it took for him to allow me to do this was even more of a rush.

With my left hand, I held his length, now growing erect, as I lightly dragged the blade around his balls.

Max got harder the longer this went on, his erection jutting out. At one point, I moved my face closer to him, sticking my tongue out and licking a little droplet of precome from the head.

"Dammit, Olivia, I can't take this much longer."

"What? Me holding this sharp object so close to your balls?"

He didn't laugh, didn't even smile at my joke. "No. Being this close to your mouth."

I was finished shaving him, so I placed the razor in the holder on the wall, then filled my cupped hands with water and rinsed him off, removing what was left of the shaving cream. I did this three or four times, completely cleaning him...

And then I took the head of his cock between my lips, massaging it like that, running my tongue over the slit, driving him even more to the edge.

Max moved his hips forward a little, sliding more of his cock into my mouth. I opened wide and took as much of it as I could, closing my lips around him.

He ran his hand though my hair, gathering it in a bunch and holding it at the back of my head - not forceful, but guiding the action.

I felt him throb. He wasn't about to come. He was flexing the muscle beneath his balls to make that happen. It was a sensation that he had created before, and I had told him how much I loved to feel it, both in my mouth and when he was inside me. He didn't always do it, preferring instead to surprise me with it.

And he did, just then. I smiled around his cock.

"Bed." That's all he said. One word. That was a rare thing with Max, but when he did so, I felt a surge of unique excitement at his blunt command.

He stood, taking me by the hand as I stepped out of the tub, and he pulled me along to the bed, where he spun me around and I landed on my back. We hadn't bothered to dry me off, so I was still damp from the waist down from sitting in the bathwater.

But, at a moment like this, who could possibly care?

Max's head was between my legs in a flash, his face buried in my sex - his nose pressing on my clit as his tongue greedily lapped, then entered me.

He grabbed my ankles and moved my feet closer to my hips, bending my knees in the process, allowing me to lift my lower body off the bed. I bucked my hips as he fucked me with his tongue in hungry, excited, but feathery soft wet strokes.

I reached down and took a handful of his hair in my fist. I loved feeling how his head made a circular motion as his tongue massaged my clit.

I moved my hips up and down, faster against his face, and felt the first wave of orgasm ripple through me.

"Come in my mouth," Max managed to say, his words intensifying the nerve-tingling rush he had brought me to.

He kept his tongue on my clit until the sensation was too great, and I pushed his head away. He rose on the bed, positioning himself between my legs. I felt the weight of his erection against my sex.

Max's mouth went right for my breasts, first sucking on my left nipple, then my right, alternating between the two. He moved his hips, rubbing the plump crown of his penis against me. His tongue licked and flicked across my nipples, until finally he took one between his tongue and his upper teeth, a feeling I loved so much it made me arch my back involuntarily.

"Offense or defense?" he breathed.

It was a running joke between us - who would be on top to start? Offense was top, defense was bottom.

"Is it my turn to choose?" I asked. "Because right now I don't care - "

And just like that, having given him the faintest green light, he plunged the tip of his cock into me, then stopped. He slipped it out a little, then pushed back in.

"I love teasing you," he said.

"You love trying to make me beg for it."

Max didn't say anything. He just kept up that taunting motion.

This too was part of the offense-defense thing we had - seeing who could hold out the longest.

I usually won this part of the battle, because Max always made me come before sex. Sometimes with his mouth, other times with his hand, and sometimes he even did it in this position using just the teasing glide of his rigid length across my wet folds.

Today, though, Max was going to win. After letting me shave him, and after that sheet-clawing orgasm he'd just given me, I wanted him inside me.

"Fuck me," I said, reached out and putting my hand on his clenched ass, pulling him into me.

He slid in with one smooth thrust.

His head dipped and his lips sealed around mine. He groaned low in his throat as he drove his cock into me to the hilt. I threw my head back and his mouth went right for my throat.

Max then got up on his knees, placing his hand under me on the small of my back, lifting me slightly. It gave him a different angle of entry and he fucked me deep and hard until I felt his cock throbbing - not the kind he controlled, but the kind I always felt as his body geared up for orgasm.

I reached up and placed my palm flat on his stomach. I loved feeling the way his muscles contracted as he moved in and out of me.

The need. The desire. The power. Everything about his intense maleness while he fucked me sent my nearly helpless body right to the edge of orgasm again.

As I clenched around him, his own throbbing increased. I felt the first hot spurt of his come jetting out of his cock, then more, more, our skin-on-skin becoming warmer and slick, until we were both spent.

FOUR

I had a lot to prove to Max. Not in a personal way, but in a professional one. He had given me a ton of responsibility, trust, and indeed power at OliviMax, and I intended to exceed his expectations.

It was just as much proving something to myself. I knew it had taken a ton of guts to come all the way to L.A. to work in show business. While I didn't have dreams as lofty as those of the countless aspiring actors out there, they were still my dreams and I wanted to realize them.

Max liked to call me his "dream girl." I liked to think he gave me my dream job. And now that I had it, I wanted to make it happen in an even bigger way.

So, without becoming a taskmaster bitch of a manager, I found some middle ground between that and being a weak "yes girl" to the people I had to deal with.

I didn't care if they knew I was the live-in girlfriend of Max Dalton. In fact, I felt no hesitation whatsoever about people knowing that about me and making my job easier. But one thing I didn't do was play that card on my own. It spoke for itself, and as I learned more about the business and became better at my job, I would soon not have to rely on that at all - I'd be my own woman.

.........<br/>

He put a finger over my lips. "No." He shook his head. "It's fucking hot."

A smile grew across my face. "Yeah?"

"Oh, yeah." He kissed me again, and his left hand slipped under the hem of my shirt, up my stomach, and pushed my bra up over my left breast. He rolled and tugged my nipple as his tongue swept through my mouth.

I watched his face as he pulled away from my lips. His eyes moved down my body, to where his hand was under my blouse, then he looked at my legs, then back up to my eyes. "If I could keep you like this forever, I would. Of course, I'd have to rearrange your position so I could have my way with you."

"You can already do that."

My breath hitched in my throat as he played a little rougher with my nipple, something I absolutely loved - the gentle touch of his soft writer's fingertips, contrasted by a pinch of an ache as he squeezed harder, then back to the tender rolling.

Max said, "I know I can do that, but not like I want to. I want to be inside you 24/7, Liv, never letting you go. I crave you."

My heart beat faster and I had to take a deep breath. Hearing words like that from the man I loved made me want to shut off the world. And, truthfully, I don't think I'd care if I ever laid eyes on another human being for the rest of my life.

"I can't have you like that," he continued, "and it kills me."

Something occurred to me and I needed to ask him. It wasn't the best time, but there really was no good time to do it. "How much of this has to do with that night?"

His jaw clenched and I could see the muscles in his face tighten. He didn't say anything.

"I know you don't want to keep talking about it and God knows I don't either, but, really....if you - "

"I don't know," he said, cutting me off mid-sentence. "I see you differently now."

I squirmed as he increased the pressure on my nipple. "How so?"

"You like that." He grinned.

I nodded.

"Good." He shifted to the other breast, and went back to the slow, easy rolling motion, giving some much desired attention to my other nipple. "The way you are here, at work, this professional side of you - "

"Yeah," I laughed, "real professional, lying here getting fondled by my boss."

Max just smiled. "We talked about that."

Several weeks ago I had made a joke about him harassing me at work, saying I'd actually like that. Max knew where I was coming from, but at the same time made it very clear that nothing would be going on in the office when other people were present, and he drew a very bright line there.

I whimpered as he drew my nipple to a hard peak.

"So," he said, "I didn't think it was possible, but I find myself even more attracted to you now."

"Because of how I am here?"

He nodded. "You're so in control. It makes me want you to give up that control to me. Or, actually, I'd rather take it from you."

I was getting wet listening to his words, and I could feel him growing harder underneath me.

Max didn't have even the slightest bit of modesty when it came to sex. He knew what he wanted. He would tell me what he wanted. He would tell me how I made him feel with my body. But I knew he was talking about something different.

And he explained: "I can't protect you from the world. I can't own you around the clock. But I can make you safe most of the time, and I can make your gorgeous body all mine. Make you come when I want. Have you make me come whenever I want."

It sounded a lot like how our relationship had been from the start, but there was something different about what he was saying, something he was implying but, unlike his usual directness, he wasn't telling me right away.

"Yeah?" was what I said, my way of asking him to explain.

He leaned down and kissed me on the mouth, letting his tongue trace around the edges of my lips. "You'll see...."

"So you're not going to tell me?"

He shook his head. "I want to have fun with this. You'll enjoy it. Trust me."

.........<br/>

Usually during this type of call, if I was there at all, I didn't say much, if anything. But this time I did, seeing how frustrated Max was.

"Listen," I said to the agent, "Forty-eight hours. That's plenty of time for Troy to read the script. The offer's on the table and we're not going to sit around and wait for him to pick up the pages. Give us a yes or no within two days or he'll never get another offer from us. Ever."

I could feel my pulse pounding in my neck. I was so worked up, not just out of anger or frustration, but at the thrill of using the power Max had given me for this job.

I looked up at Max, whose eyes were wide, and I watched a grin slowly overtake his face. He leaned forward, closer to the phone and said, "Gotta go, Ben. Talk to you in two days." Max ended the call.

We were sitting on the couch. Max was holding a script, and I was sitting next to him. When the call from Ben had come in, I had been flipping through some headshots of various people we were thinking about auditioning for supporting roles for the new film.

I looked at Max. "Surprised?"

"That's part of it." He put his script to the side, took the photos from my hand and put them on the coffee table. Then pulled me closer to him, turning me onto my back and lowering me so he was cradling me in his arms. He bent his head down and gave me a long kiss. "The way you walk around here, the way you were on the phone just now," he said, "like you own this damn town."

I felt my face start to blush. "I'm sorry - "

He put a finger over my lips. "No." He shook his head. "It's fucking hot."

A smile grew across my face. "Yeah?"

"Oh, yeah." He kissed me again, and his left hand slipped under the hem of my shirt, up my stomach, and pushed my bra up over my left breast. He rolled and tugged my nipple as his tongue swept through my mouth.

FIVE

I didn't have to wait long to find out what he had in store for me. It reminded me of the way he told me months ago, shortly after first meeting him, that the next time we saw each other he would make it a surprise. And did he ever.

After leaving our offices that day a little early, we went home to get ready to have some friends over for a cookout.

These were Max's friends who he hadn't spent much time with over the last several months, and I had encouraged him to get in touch with them. He'd been spending nearly all of his free time with me, first nursing me back to health, then getting into the swing of the new production company.

I didn't want him to keep doing that at the expense of not spending time with his friends. Plus, I hadn't met anyone socially since moving to LA and I was eager to have something like that in my life as well.

Max had two best friends. Anthony, a reality TV producer who, from afar, could pass for a young Jack Nicholson, complete with the omnipresent sunglasses. And then there was Carl, an entertainment lawyer, and the type of guy you might not be surprised to find out that he ironed his socks.

Each was married, and I immediately took a liking to their wives.

Anthony's wife Monica was a booker for The Tonight Show. If Lisa Rinna ever needed a body double, Monica would be perfect. Carl's wife Loralei was an immigration attorney, and someone who could never sneak up on you thanks to the fact that her wrists were always heavily festooned with loud, jangling bracelets.

These were real powerhouse couples, and for a short time I was a bit unnerved by that fact, but had to keep reminding myself that Max and I were very much the same, only without the married part.

Max and the guys did the cooking on the large built-in brick BBQ grill in our yard, while Monica, Loralei and I sipped appletinis by the pool. Doing something like this in December back home in Ohio would be impossible, but southern California gave us relatively comfortable nights, and on this night Max had also fired up the outdoor heaters just in case.

Loralei and Monica didn't exactly cross-examine me, but they were very interested in getting to know the woman who was taking up so much of Max's time these days.

I had a moment of worry when I started to talk about the night Chris came to my apartment and attacked me. They didn't know anything about it, so obviously Max hadn't told anyone. After filling them in on the details I asked them to keep it to themselves that I had told them.

"Of course," Monica said, touching my arm to reassure me.

Loralei nodded in agreement. "Carl tells me everything, and he hasn't said the first word about all of that so I guess he doesn't know, either."

"Same with Anthony," Monica added.

I said, "Thanks, I really appreciate it," but didn't go into why I was grateful for their discretion.

Max undoubtedly didn't want anyone to know that he hadn't been there to protect me. The only person he'd talked to about it was me. I felt badly for him again, even though it had been a while since he had even hinted at the episode and I was pretty sure he was over it.

As we ate around the large marble table that was built into the patio under the overhang, Anthony and Carl shared some stories about Max, clearly one of those "guy things" meant to embarrass their friend in front of his new girlfriend.

Carl was more of a quiet type, while Anthony was the real talker, and Carl simply filled in a few details along the way.

Anthony told of the time Max was casting for a film and almost decided to hire an actress who wasn't an actress at all, but rather an actor who had undergone an extremely convincing sex change.

"Not that I wouldn't have hired her," Max said. "She was good. It's just that when the story broke, I knew everyone would focus on that instead of the film, and we just couldn't do that."

"Where is she now?" I asked.

Anthony said, "Doing Internet porn."

Monica shot her eyes at him. "And you know this...how?"

"Research." He shrugged. "It might make for a good reality show. And, I should add in my defense, if it does sell, you'll have that house in Acapulco you always wanted."

Monica said, "Good answer," then she laughed, giving everyone else the green light to join in, and I followed hesitantly, a stark reminder that I was the new member of this group of longtime friends. It would clearly take some getting used to, but I liked all of them, and most of all I liked that they provided a new lens through which I saw Max.

He was a great conversationalist, that much I knew, but he was the same with a group of people. Maybe that had something to do with the fact that he was a writer and therefore, a natural storyteller.

Throughout the evening, I noticed Max looking at me the same way he'd been looking at me lately in the office.

I would catch him staring. He would have a look of intense concentration in his facial expression, especially in his eyes, the way they were virtually scanning my body from head to toe.

There was an unmistakable possessiveness to his gaze. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that from time to time I felt like a gazelle being watched by a lion. The only difference: I had no intention of being the type of prey that runs. I wanted him to catch me.

.........<br/>

When his lips moved to my neck, I said, "I thought last night would have been enough to tide you over until at least tonight."

"Not even close," he said, his breath hot on my throat. "Do you want me to stop?"

"Would it matter if I said yes?"

"No," he said.

He held me tightly, possessively, and turned me around to face the window. Outside, people walked down the sidewalk just feet from my window, separated only by a short hedgerow of shrubbery, and the faintly tinted window of my office. It wasn't completely darkened, so passersby could see in if they looked hard enough.

The bustling crowds of people on their way to lunch or meetings or sight-seeing moved quickly down the sidewalk, not appearing to have the slightest hint of what was going on behind that tinted window, but if someone stopped and looked for more than a few seconds, they would easily be able to make out my hands pressed to the glass, probably my face, and maybe Max standing behind me, too.

"I think they can see," I said.

Max lifted my skirt but didn't say anything.

"Max..."

I felt his erection straining against his linen pants, pressed against my ass.

"Relax," he said in a stern whisper. "I've got this."

I trusted him, and honestly, the proximity to people walking by added more than a little extra thrill.

Max's fingers slipped beneath the elastic on the leg-hole of my panties. He pulled them to the side, while simultaneously using one finger to brush over my sex, slipping through the folds, upwards, making a quick touch-and-go on my clit, sending a jolt of need through my body.

With both hands, he held onto my hips and pulled me back toward him. I wore heels, but still needed to get on my tip-toes a little as he lined up to enter me.

The head of his excited cock notched at my opening of my pussy.

And he pushed in with a long stroke.

I gasped and my eyelids fluttered in response, then I refocused on the view in front of me - people dressed for work, tourists dressed for a day of exploring, a postal worker carrying a large bag, a woman jogging by with a dog, families, individuals...a cross-section of people strolling by as I stood there impaled on Max's magnificent erection.

"I can't stay out of you, Olivia."

I breathed heavily as he fucked me, deep and slow.

With one hand he bunched my hair in his fist, turning my head to the side. He craned his neck to reach me, and his tongue plunged into my mouth, sweeping through my mouth, a move he synchronized with each thrust of his hips, shoving inside me.

He was doing me harder than usual, his lust surely spiked as high as I'd ever experienced it.

"Max," I said through a long exhale. "Fuck me just like that. Don't stop."

His voice like course gravel, he said, "I would never stop if I didn't have to, Liv."

"Oh, God," I sighed, feeling the warmth of the first spurts of his come.

Max buried his face in my hair against the back of my head.

I reached up, behind me, and held onto the side of his face.

He kept pumping his hips as he pumped his semen into me.

"I'm going to come," I said. "Make me come, please."

Max kept going, not losing his erection at all after coming.

My legs got weak. Max noticed. He wrapped one arm around my waist and lifted me off the floor a few inches, turning us both around.

I hated the feeling of his cock slipping out of me, but it was only for a moment.

He hovered over me as he lay me on the desk. He worked my panties down my legs.

"I'm going to make you come all over my cock, Liv."

I opened my eyes and they locked onto his burning gaze as he stared back at me, picking up the pace, driving into me so hard.

He wrapped my panties around both of my wrists, then pushed my arms up over my head. With one hand, he held my bound wrists in place, trapping me as he wanted me.

His hips got into a steady rhythm for a few moments, his free hand lowering down to my sex, as he massaged my clit with his thumb.

Then, a knock at the door.

"Olivia?" It was the voice of Kristen, my assistant. "Your lunch is here."

A smile spread across Max's face.

I was breathing heavily, almost gasping for air.

Max fucked me harder.

"Better answer her," he said.

"A minute!" I said. It was all I was able to get out.

"Okay," she said, barely audible to me now from the other side of the door, but also because my heart was beating so fast and hard it was the loudest noise I was picking up.

As Max thumbed my clit in circles, my stomach muscles started to contract and relax, and one of the most intense orgasms of my life began.

The clenching tightened around his cock as I arched my back and moaned.

Max came again. It was the first time I had ever had that happen with any guy, let alone Max, and now I knew an entirely new side of his potent virility.

I had a moment of worry when I started to talk about the night Chris came to my apartment and attacked me. They didn't know anything about it, so obviously Max hadn't told anyone. After filling them in on the details I asked them to keep it to themselves that I had told them.

"Of course," Monica said, touching my arm to reassure me.

Loralei nodded in agreement. "Carl tells me everything, and he hasn't said the first word about all of that so I guess he doesn't know, either."

"Same with Anthony," Monica added.

I said, "Thanks, I really appreciate it," but didn't go into why I was grateful for their discretion.

Max undoubtedly didn't want anyone to know that he hadn't been there to protect me. The only person he'd talked to about it was me. I felt badly for him again, even though it had been a while since he had even hinted at the episode and I was pretty sure he was over it.

As we ate around the large marble table that was built into the patio under the overhang, Anthony and Carl shared some stories about Max, clearly one of those "guy things" meant to embarrass their friend in front of his new girlfriend.

Carl was more of a quiet type, while Anthony was the real talker, and Carl simply filled in a few details along the way.

Anthony told of the time Max was casting for a film and almost decided to hire an actress who wasn't an actress at all, but rather an actor who had undergone an extremely convincing sex change.

"Not that I wouldn't have hired her," Max said. "She was good. It's just that when the story broke, I knew everyone would focus on that instead of the film, and we just couldn't do that."

"Where is she now?" I asked.

Anthony said, "Doing Internet porn."

Monica shot her eyes at him. "And you know this...how?"

"Research." He shrugged. "It might make for a good reality show. And, I should add in my defense, if it does sell, you'll have that house in Acapulco you always wanted."

Monica said, "Good answer," then she laughed, giving everyone else the green light to join in, and I followed hesitantly, a stark reminder that I was the new member of this group of longtime friends. It would clearly take some getting used to, but I liked all of them, and most of all I liked that they provided a new lens through which I saw Max.

He was a great conversationalist, that much I knew, but he was the same with a group of people. Maybe that had something to do with the fact that he was a writer and therefore, a natural storyteller.

Throughout the evening, I noticed Max looking at me the same way he'd been looking at me lately in the office.

I would catch him staring. He would have a look of intense concentration in his facial expression, especially in his eyes, the way they were virtually scanning my body from head to toe.

There was an unmistakable possessiveness to his gaze. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that from time to time I felt like a gazelle being watched by a lion. The only difference: I had no intention of being the type of prey that runs. I wanted him to catch me.

.........<br/>

"I think they can see," I said.

Max lifted my skirt but didn't say anything.

"Max..."

I felt his erection straining against his linen pants, pressed against my ass.

"Relax," he said in a stern whisper. "I've got this."

I trusted him, and honestly, the proximity to people walking by added more than a little extra thrill.

Max's fingers slipped beneath the elastic on the leg-hole of my panties. He pulled them to the side, while simultaneously using one finger to brush over my sex, slipping through the folds, upwards, making a quick touch-and-go on my clit, sending a jolt of need through my body.

With both hands, he held onto my hips and pulled me back toward him. I wore heels, but still needed to get on my tip-toes a little as he lined up to enter me.

The head of his excited cock notched at my opening of my pussy.

And he pushed in with a long stroke.

I gasped and my eyelids fluttered in response, then I refocused on the view in front of me - people dressed for work, tourists dressed for a day of exploring, a postal worker carrying a large bag, a woman jogging by with a dog, families, individuals...a cross-section of people strolling by as I stood there impaled on Max's magnificent erection.

"I can't stay out of you, Olivia."

I breathed heavily as he fucked me, deep and slow.

With one hand he bunched my hair in his fist, turning my head to the side. He craned his neck to reach me, and his tongue plunged into my mouth, sweeping through my mouth, a move he synchronized with each thrust of his hips, shoving inside me.

He was doing me harder than usual, his lust surely spiked as high as I'd ever experienced it.

"Max," I said through a long exhale. "Fuck me just like that. Don't stop."

His voice like course gravel, he said, "I would never stop if I didn't have to, Liv."

"Oh, God," I sighed, feeling the warmth of the first spurts of his come.

Max buried his face in my hair against the back of my head.

I reached up, behind me, and held onto the side of his face.

He kept pumping his hips as he pumped his semen into me.

"I'm going to come," I said. "Make me come, please."

Max kept going, not losing his erection at all after coming.

My legs got weak. Max noticed. He wrapped one arm around my waist and lifted me off the floor a few inches, turning us both around.

I hated the feeling of his cock slipping out of me, but it was only for a moment.

He hovered over me as he lay me on the desk. He worked my panties down my legs.

"I'm going to make you come all over my cock, Liv."

I opened my eyes and they locked onto his burning gaze as he stared back at me, picking up the pace, driving into me so hard.

He wrapped my panties around both of my wrists, then pushed my arms up over my head. With one hand, he held my bound wrists in place, trapping me as he wanted me.

His hips got into a steady rhythm for a few moments, his free hand lowering down to my sex, as he massaged my clit with his thumb.

Then, a knock at the door.

"Olivia?" It was the voice of Kristen, my assistant. "Your lunch is here."

A smile spread across Max's face.

I was breathing heavily, almost gasping for air.

Max fucked me harder.

"Better answer her," he said.

"A minute!" I said. It was all I was able to get out.

"Okay," she said, barely audible to me now from the other side of the door, but also because my heart was beating so fast and hard it was the loudest noise I was picking up.

As Max thumbed my clit in circles, my stomach muscles started to contract and relax, and one of the most intense orgasms of my life began.

The clenching tightened around his cock as I arched my back and moaned.

Max came again. It was the first time I had ever had that happen with any guy, let alone Max, and now I knew an entirely new side of his potent virility.

Getting to know Monica and Loralei was good for me. It was nice to have some girlfriends and feel like there was more to my life than work and home. Not that either of those aspects of my new life with Max were lacking in any way. It's just that sometimes you need space even from the things you value most.

What I didn't plan on, however, was the revelation that occurred one day while the three of us were having lunch in Beverly Hills.

We were halfway through our meal when Monica asked about the new production company. I told her how hard Max was working, and she said, "He's always been a workaholic as long as I've known him. But, trust me, I've never seen him happier, and it's not just about the company. I can't imagine Max ever being giddy about something, but you've almost made him that way."

It was such a sweet compliment, especially coming from someone who had known him for years. I started to thank her, but Loralei spoke first.

"I agree. Even happier than when he was with Ty, and I never thought I'd see that."

Monica looked at Loralei, then immediately noticed the quizzical expression on my face, and she probably saw me swallow hard, too.

"Oh, sorry," Loralei said. "I shouldn't have said that."

"No." I cleared my throat and reached for my drink, desperately needing to wash away the sudden dryness in my mouth and throat. I'd never felt so jealous in my life. And Max had never mentioned anyone named Ty. "I don't know who that is."

The two of them looked at each other, as if they were engaged in some kind of telepathic rock-paper-scissors decision over which one should tell me about her.

Loralei said, "Tyler Morgan. She lived with Max for a year."

"Just over ten months," Monica added.

Loralei looked at Monica. "Close enough." She looked back at me. "Anyway, they were pretty serious. But Max didn't know she had a secret life going on."

My stomach sank and I felt like I was going to lose everything I'd just eaten. I tried to keep a stoic look on my face, though. I didn't want to give them any reason to stop telling the story.

"She was an up-and-coming actress," Loralei said. "She hadn't been in anything big yet, but her name was tossed around town for several projects by major directors. And one of those was Max."

"But it never happened. She was heavily into drugs," Monica said.

"I don't know how she hid it from Max all that time," Loralei said. "Or how she hid it from us. Nobody noticed a thing. Until the end..."

The end. Those words were so ominous, I feared the worst. That somehow Max had caught her using, or she'd been arrested, or simply bolted and left Max with a broken heart.

"It all happened so fast," Loralei continued, "everyone was in shock. Definitely not as much as Max, but...she OD'd one night outside a club in LA. Max was on a location shoot in south Florida."

The waiter came by, dropped off the check, and Monica grabbed it. "So I get the call. I'm still not sure why that happened. But Carl and I went to the hospital and were given the news. Carl called Max and he flew home overnight."

"Jesus," was all I could manage, as I looked away from them and watched a droplet of condensation slide down my glass.

"I've never heard him say a word about it since," Monica said.

Loralei's expression agreed with Monica. "That's probably why he never told you."

Yeah, I thought. That could be why. But this was an aspect of Max's life I wanted to know about. Not just because it was another girl he had loved, but I wondered if he was really, truly over her, and what, if anything, all of it had to do with his need to protect me.

.........<br/>

It was a script he had written when he was nineteen and had never gone back to do a rewrite on it. He made this clear to the studio execs, and they said they'd give him time to do a fresh draft. The time they gave him turned out to be two days. They rushed production, cast a relatively unknown actor for the lead, and the movie tanked upon release. It was one of the worst opening weekends for a highly anticipated summer blockbuster in the studio's history.

"I was at a beach party in Santa Monica, and the stuff was everywhere. I was drunk and had hit a bong a few times, and then I tried coke for the first time. Before I knew it, that's all I was doing. Staying up for days on end, missing important phone calls and meetings, lashing out at people - verbally, not physically - and I wasn't myself. Carl and Anthony took me to a rehab center. I checked in willingly, by the way."

"My God, Max. I had no idea."

He huffed out a little laugh. "Yeah, almost nobody does."

"Your mom?"

He put his head back on the seat. "No, I lied and told her I was on business for a while and that I'd be out of the country. She bought it. I was in rehab for 90 days. That first night was the loneliest night of my life. I stayed up visualizing my entire life being wiped away, everything I had worked so hard for."

I lowered my head so our faces were close to each other. "You saved Krystal's life like Anthony and Carl saved yours. Don't you see that?"

"I just did what I could."

.........<br/>

When he got close to me, I threw my arms around his waist, feeling myself enveloped in his strong embrace.

He kissed me on the forehead.

I looked up. "I'm sorry, but I have to know." I swallowed hard as he looked down at me, a look of extreme concern on his face. "Tell me about Ty."

Max's eyes closed instantly as he let out a heavy, long sigh.

"I don't talk about it."

"Yeah, I kind of picked up on that."

He paused, then said, "It's in the past, Olivia. It doesn't mean anything anymore."

"It matters to me."

"Why?"

I pulled him by the hand and we went over to the couch. Max sat and I lowered myself onto his lap, putting my arms around his neck.

"It's a part of you," I said. "I want to know."

He shook his head.

"Is it too painful?" I asked.

"I told you, it doesn't matter anymore. I worked through it and I'm over it. It's like it was never part of my life."

I got a chill down my spine when he said that. For some reason, I took it as coldly as one could possibly mean it.

"That sounds terrible," he continued, correcting himself. "I don't mean it like that. I had to move on, and the only way to do that was to not look back."

Although the circumstances were different, that's kind of what I had been doing with regard to Chris. There was nothing harsh about my decision to dismiss Chris from my past, and now I understood that Max didn't mean it that way about Tyler Morgan, either.

And then, suddenly, without any prompting from me, Max reversed his earlier statement about not talking about her and he opened up. "She lived with me. It wasn't quite a year. Did they tell you this already?"

"Some of it," I said.

Max emitted a soft laugh. "Let me guess. Loralei slipped up."

"How'd you know?"

"She's always doing shit like that. Be careful what you tell her. I thought about telling you when Krystal was in real trouble."

I hadn't even considered a connection between the two. "Is that why you helped her?"

He nodded. "It happens all the time, especially in this town, but because she's a friend of yours, it was too close to home and I knew if I didn't try to help it would haunt me."

"You saved her life."

"I don't know about that," he said.

I pushed back from him, taking his face between my hands. "You did."

I kissed him and we fell together - Max on his back, me on top of him. It wasn't sexual, it was purely an emotional moment.

I lay my head on his chest, thinking about all that I'd just learned about him, and decided to let the silence continue for a few moments.

"I love this town," he said, "almost everything about it. I've just seen that too many times, and with her...it was unbearable."

I watched his face turn to stone as he stared at the window. I didn't know what to say, which was fine, because I knew I needed to let him proceed at his own comfortable pace.

He looked at me. "I had a problem, Liv. For about six months." He let it hang there without finishing.

"What do you mean?" I said.

He turned his head to look away from me again.

I put my hand on his chin and turned his head back toward me, and he offered no resistance. "Max, you had a problem...?"

"Coke. I had done my share of weed, but I eventually gave in to the temptation of coke. It was everywhere. Everyone had it, everyone was doing it, everyone was sharing or selling. I was at my weakest point in life. It was just after 'Circus Daydream' came out. A few weeks after, actually."

He was talking about his one and only box-office flop. It was a script he had written hastily at the urging of the studio. Max had told me once that it was in the top three regrets of his professional life. He caved to their demands. They wanted to rush something else out that had his name attached to the project, and "Circus Daydream" was the only thing he had ready to go at the moment.

It was a script he had written when he was nineteen and had never gone back to do a rewrite on it. He made this clear to the studio execs, and they said they'd give him time to do a fresh draft. The time they gave him turned out to be two days. They rushed production, cast a relatively unknown actor for the lead, and the movie tanked upon release.

I checked in willingly, by the way."

"My God, Max. I had no idea."

He huffed out a little laugh. "Yeah, almost nobody does."

"Your mom?"

He put his head back on the seat. "No, I lied and told her I was on business for a while and that I'd be out of the country. She bought it. I was in rehab for 90 days.

"I just did what I could."

A few days before flying to Ohio for Christmas, I went to see Max's mother. Alone.

With things becoming serious between Max and me, I wanted to be a part of his entire world, and for me that meant making an effort to be closer with his mom, someone who was extremely important in his life.

I told Max that I wanted to make it a day trip, treat Paula to lunch, and give her the Christmas gift I'd purchased for her.

So I called Paula that morning and surprised her. I figured she wouldn't have any plans, as she didn't do much socially, and she said she'd be excited to see me.

I picked her up at her house and we went to a little restaurant tucked between a shoe store and a nail place in a strip mall.

The place had a wood floor that creaked with each step, and the air was redolent of grilled meat and steamed vegetables. A perky hostess lead us to a table near the front of the restaurant where Paula sat with her back to the window and I sat across from her, with a clear view of the sidewalk and street.

We both ordered salads with grilled salmon chunks and as we ate, she told me more about Max as a child.

"He was always a little introverted and quiet. Did he ever tell you the story about how he didn't talk until he was four?"

I stopped chewing, surprised, and shook my head.

She laughed lightly. "He made noises and the typical cooing that you'd expect from a baby. But the more his father and I tried to get him to speak, the more he would look at us like we were aliens or something. We became concerned about it, so I took him to the pediatrician."

"Wow."

She nodded, sipping her tea. "Yeah, we had just reached a point of panic, I suppose. We knew he wasn't deaf - he would respond to noises - but we feared maybe it was something neurological. But it wasn't anything. You know what the doctor told me?"

"What?"

"He said, 'Maybe he just doesn't have anything to say.'"

We both laughed at that. Not only because it was a funny comment coming from a medical professional, but because we were talking about Max, whose entire life was built around using words.

Actually, written words more than spoken, now that I thought of it. Maybe that had something to do with him being more comfortable writing words that others would speak.

Then again, he was never at a loss of words when it came to me....

"He's nothing like that now," I said, not elaborating any further.

"Oh, no, he's much different."

"So, when did he start talking?"

She thought about it for a few seconds as she chewed and then said, "Five and a half. Then he wouldn't stop. Of course he started to become a little withdrawn and that's when he started writing."

I looked out the glass front of the restaurant because a woman walking by caught my eye. Her entire head was wrapped in gauze. I briefly wondered if she had been in some kind of accident, but then when I saw her oversized breasts, I realized that she probably had just had some work done north of her new boobs.

"I'm sure he told you about our life before California?" Paula asked.

"He did."

A somber look overtook her face like a veil of sadness and regret.

"I'm not going to ask," I reassured her. "But I'd love to know anything else you'd like to share about Max."

Her face brightened again. Clearly he was the jewel of her life. She was so proud of him, as well she should be.

"You're the first young woman he's introduced me to."

"Really..."

She said, "I mean, aside from when he was a teenager. He had a girlfriend that we knew, but only somewhat. In California, though, he's always kept his girlfriends to himself. I'm not sure what that's all about. I'm a nice person, easy to get along with."

She really was. "I don't think it has anything to do with you," I said. I wondered if he had ever so much as mentioned Tyler to his mother. Maybe it was better that I not find out the hard way.

She lowered her voice and said, "He's nothing like his father."

I just looked at Paula, her eyes radiating sincerity.

"I know," I said. "And for what it's worth, I really love him."

Later, when we got back to her house, she made orange spice tea, and told me it was a Christmas tradition with her family that her great-grandmother started. I pretended to like it, but worried a little about future Christmases with her. I'd have to find a way around that. At least she didn't offer me any fruitcake.

I sat on the couch with a dog on each side of me. I couldn't have told you which was Zeke and which was Dolly. But who really cared? They were cute and friendly, and the more time I spent at Paula's house, the more I realized they truly were her live-in family.

"This is wonderful," she said, as she opened the Christmas gift I gave her. "I'm going to put it right up here." She walked over to the fireplace and put it on the mantle, just above the three stockings, one of which had my name on it.

The gift was a framed picture of Max and me, taken by Anthony on the night we had the cookout. The Pacific was in the background, the sun was setting, and Max had playfully grabbed me by the waist, dipped me in dramatic fashion, and kissed me. Anthony snapped the picture without us knowing.

It was then that I noticed for the first time, despite having been in her house several times, that the only picture she had displayed in the entire house was one of Max as a baby. There were no other family photos. I wondered if there was a sad reason for that, and figured there probably was.

The way she looked at the picture of Max and me made my heart warm.

Paula said, "I have something for you, too." She went to the Christmas tree and retrieved a small wrapped box.

"You really shouldn't have, Paula."

"Don't be silly," she said as she made her way over to the couch and sat down beside me. "I have that stocking with your name on it hung by the chimney with care" - she smiled and winked - "and even though I wish you were going to be here with us, I know how important it is to be with your family." She held the box out.

I opened my hand and took it. "Thank you." I started to unwrap the paper, thinking the box was just the right size to hold a watch or bracelet.

But it was neither. I opened the rectangular box to find a sterling silver spoon.

"This," Paula said, "was Max's spoon when he was a baby."

I took a deep breath, suddenly having realized I'd been holding it in. "It's beautiful," I said, "but...why?"

Her head turned quickly to look from the spoon to me.

"I'm sorry," I said. "I didn't mean it to sound ungrateful. I'm just...surprised. Don't you want to keep this?"

"I've had it for years, and it's one of my most precious possessions, but I want you to have it. When Max and I left his father, I didn't bring much with me. But this was one of those things. In the back of my mind, I thought it might be of value in case we had to sell it. Sterling silver might have fetched a hundred dollars or so, and it would have been good in a pinch, but thankfully I didn't have to sell it."

I thought back to Max telling me how he had blackmailed his father before leaving, and that was the money that kept them afloat for a while. I wondered if his mother knew that, but there was no way I was going to ask.

"Oh, no," I said, genuinely feeling sorry for her, but also at the thought of the two of them trying to make a new life away from the abusive man she married and who fathered the man I loved.

I was feeling a bit unworthy of taking this amazing gift, but I also knew I couldn't reject it. That would have been an insult of the highest order.

I reached out for her and we hugged.

"I want you to have it," she said, "because you're going to be Max's wife and the mother of his children."

I pulled back from her, my arms still on her shoulders. I could feel my eyes drying out quickly from being open wide and not being able to blink.

"Relax," she said. "I don't know when it's going to happen. I just know it is. I can read my son. Trust me. And I don't know when you'll have your first child. I may not be around to see the day."

I looked out the glass front of the restaurant because a woman walking by caught my eye. Her entire head was wrapped in gauze. I briefly wondered if she had been in some kind of accident, but then when I saw her oversized breasts, I realized that she probably had just had some work done north of her new boobs.

"I'm sure he told you about our life before California?" Paula asked.

"He did."

A somber look overtook her face like a veil of sadness and regret.

"I'm not going to ask," I reassured her. "But I'd love to know anything else you'd like to share about Max."

Her face brightened again. Clearly he was the jewel of her life. She was so proud of him, as well she should be.

"You're the first young woman he's introduced me to."

"Really..."

She said, "I mean, aside from when he was a teenager. He had a girlfriend that we knew, but only somewhat. In California, though, he's always kept his girlfriends to himself. I'm not sure what that's all about. I'm a nice person, easy to get along with."

She really was. "I don't think it has anything to do with you," I said. I wondered if he had ever so much as mentioned Tyler to his mother. Maybe it was better that I not find out the hard way.

She lowered her voice and said, "He's nothing like his father."

I just looked at Paula, her eyes radiating sincerity.

"I know," I said. "And for what it's worth, I really love him."

Later, when we got back to her house, she made orange spice tea, and told me it was a Christmas tradition with her family that her great-grandmother started. I pretended to like it, but worried a little about future Christmases with her. I'd have to find a way around that. At least she didn't offer me any fruitcake.

I sat on the couch with a dog on each side of me. I couldn't have told you which was Zeke and which was Dolly. But who really cared? They were cute and friendly, and the more time I spent at Paula's house, the more I realized they truly were her live-in family.

"This is wonderful," she said, as she opened the Christmas gift I gave her. "I'm going to put it right up here." She walked over to the fireplace and put it on the mantle, just above the three stockings, one of which had my name on it.

The gift was a framed picture of Max and me, taken by Anthony on the night we had the cookout. The Pacific was in the background, the sun was setting, and Max had playfully grabbed me by the waist, dipped me in dramatic fashion, and kissed me. Anthony snapped the picture without us knowing.

It was then that I noticed for the first time, despite having been in her house several times, that the only picture she had displayed in the entire house was one of Max as a baby. There were no other family photos. I wondered if there was a sad reason for that, and figured there probably was.

The way she looked at the picture of Max and me made my heart warm.

Paula said, "I have something for you, too." She went to the Christmas tree and retrieved a small wrapped box.

"You really shouldn't have, Paula."

"Don't be silly," she said as she made her way over to the couch and sat down beside me. "I have that stocking with your name on it hung by the chimney with care" - she smiled and winked - "and even though I wish you were going to be here with us, I know how important it is to be with your family." She held the box out.

I opened my hand and took it. "Thank you." I started to unwrap the paper, thinking the box was just the right size to hold a watch or bracelet.

But it was neither. I opened the rectangular box to find a sterling silver spoon.

"This," Paula said, "was Max's spoon when he was a baby."

I took a deep breath, suddenly having realized I'd been holding it in. "It's beautiful," I said, "but...why?"

Her head turned quickly to look from the spoon to me.

"I'm sorry," I said. "I didn't mean it to sound ungrateful. I'm just...surprised. Don't you want to keep this?"

"I've had it for years, and it's one of my most precious possessions, but I want you to have it. When Max and I left his father, I didn't bring much with me. But this was one of those things. In the back of my mind, I thought it might be of value in case we had to sell it. Sterling silver might have fetched a hundred dollars or so, and it would have been good in a pinch, but thankfully I didn't have to sell it."

I thought back to Max telling me how he had blackmailed his father before leaving, and that was the money that kept them afloat for a while. I wondered if his mother knew that, but there was no way I was going to ask.

"Oh, no," I said, genuinely feeling sorry for her, but also at the thought of the two of them trying to make a new life away from the abusive man she married and who fathered the man I loved.

I was feeling a bit unworthy of taking this amazing gift, but I also knew I couldn't reject it. That would have been an insult of the highest order.

I reached out for her and we hugged.

"I want you to have it," she said, "because you're going to be Max's wife and the mother of his children."

I pulled back from her, my arms still on her shoulders. I could feel my eyes drying out quickly from being open wide and not being able to blink.

"Relax," she said. "I don't know when it's going to happen. I just know it is. I can read my son. Trust me. And I don't know when you'll have your first child. I may not be around to see the day."

EIGHT

Six days later I was back in Ohio, in my parents' house, and within the first hour or so I knew it wasn't going to be an easy stay.

Things were still not smoothed over from everything that had happened since I'd moved to LA, and more specifically, since all that happened when my parents and my sister Grace were visiting.

My father - clearly the leader of the family - had seemed to come to peace with it after meeting Max in the hospital, but I guess he and my mom forgot all of that when they got home.

I was staying in my old bedroom. Every time I went in that room was like walking back in time.

Posters of my favorite bands and actors from my high school days covered almost every inch of the walls. My old desk in the corner still held some books from English classes. All of my old clothes were still in the closet and in the dresser.

Despite the fact that I had been a college graduate the last time I slept in that room, this time I felt like I was back in high school. Like I was a teenager who had run away from home, only to come back to the concentration-camp-like setting I'd so desperately wanted to escape for years.

Okay, so it sounds dramatic. But being in that teenage girl mindset, of course my view on things was over the top. I would only be here for a few days, I reminded myself over and over, and then I'd be the adult Olivia again once I got back to my real home in Malibu.

Not helping matters on this trip was the fact that I flew home on Max's jet. My parents would have much preferred to pick me up at a commercial airline terminal, but instead they waited in the small lobby at the far north side of the airport where all the private jet traffic came and went.

The first night I was back, my parents cooked a big dinner. Grace and her husband came, and of course my little niece and nephew. And, once again, the babies provided a nice distraction from what would have been an otherwise entirely contentious evening.

That didn't start until later, when the kids had drifted off to sleep. I helped Grace put them in the guest room, which mom and dad had converted to a room just for the little ones.

Back in the den, we all sat around sipping hot chocolate. Mom, as usual, had decorated the house for Christmas in great style. The tree was beautiful, and with the lamps dimmed, it provided soft lighting as we talked.

It was mostly small-talk to begin with, but then mom asked when or if I'd be moving.

"Where?" I said.

"To your own place."

I sighed. I looked at Grace, who had a look of solidarity on her face, but didn't say anything.

"I'm not."

My father got up and went through the swinging door to the kitchen.

"You're making enough to do that, right?" Mom said.

I decided not to answer that question. I wanted to cut straight to the heart of the matter. "I thought you guys saw how good Max is to me after all that went down. That should count for something, right? Or am I really going to have to live the rest of my life making decisions based on what makes you happy rather than what makes me happy?"

My father came out of the kitchen, holding nothing, so I knew he hadn't gone in there to get anything, he had done it just to get away.

"Don't speak to your mother like that," he said. "She's only concerned about what's best for you. We all are."

I looked at Grace, who spoke up: "I think she's going to be okay."

Grace's husband, Terry, was an auto mechanic, a quiet guy, always nice enough and I liked him, but there was no way he was taking sides in this. He examined his drink with undue intensity.

I excused myself, went up to my room and lay down on the bed. I felt 15 again.

.........<br/>

Grace had failed to tell me how different Krystal looked, even though she'd seen her several times since Krystal moved back to Ohio. After all, they were really friends before I moved to LA and stayed with Krystal in her apartment. The two of us had never really forged a serious friendship bond, at least until after all that shit went down and Max basically saved her life.

Krystal picked us up in a car that her parents gave her when they got a new one. She used it to get to her new job as a bakery worker in a grocery store, a job she loved and was proud of, unlike the kind of work she had done in LA.

On the way to the mall she was full of questions about how I was doing in LA, and of course she wanted to know all about Max, so I filled her in on the latest.

"You're not going to believe what his mother gave me for Christmas," I said, adding, "Grace, don't tell mom and dad. I want to tell them at the right time."

"Okay," she said. "But what was it?"

I told them, and they were both moved by the story.

"That's so sweet," Grace said.

"I think his mom is right," Krystal added. "You two are so going to get married."

"It's never been what I wanted," I told them, something I always hesitated to share with Grace, who was all about marriage and kids, which is why I hadn't yet told her what I was about to.

"Right, it's not what you wanted," Krystal said. "It wasn't what I wanted, either. I thought I wanted to live the Hollywood dream and look where that got me. I'm a small-town girl. I forgot who I was."

I thought about that for a moment, wondering if she was trying to tell me I was the same. I half-expected Grace to chime in with exactly that thought, but she remained quiet.

"But," Krystal said, "that's just me. You're obviously in a much better situation than I was. I mean, God...sometimes I think back on it and it's like it wasn't even me, but it was."

"It wasn't."

"Yes, it was."

"No," I said, trying to reassure her. "You lost your way, and all that crap was someone on drugs - not you, not the real you."

"It wasn't you at all," Grace said.

Krystal shook her head. "I take responsibility for all of it. I have to. I see what you're saying and I appreciate it, but owning up to it is the only way I'll continue to get better. And speaking of better, I don't think we're going to find a better parking spot than this."

She pulled into the first and only open spot we saw, which seemed to be a half-mile from the mall.

We hit two shoe stores, where I found a few pairs that I wanted, and bought Grace a pair that she said she liked but didn't want to spend the money on. There was a temporary standoff with Grace insisting that I couldn't buy them for her, and me finally winning the debate with the reasoning that I'd already seen them, so I knew what she wanted and I knew her shoe size, and she couldn't stop me from buying them.

Krystal didn't spend any money. She didn't even try any on. She seemed distracted the whole time we were walking around, and we finally found out why when we passed a Baby Gap store.

Krystal stopped, and then turned to us and said, "Okay, I can't keep this a secret anymore."

On a bench in the middle of the mall, with hundreds of people streaming by us, and jolly Christmas music playing over the speakers, Krystal said, "I'm pregnant."

I couldn't have been more surprised, and apparently Grace was in the same position because we both simultaneously looked down at Krystal's belly. She wasn't showing. Earlier when I had noticed that she'd put on some weight, I thought it was simply because she was off the drugs and her health was improving. Now, hearing the news, there was obviously more to it.

"How far along are you?" Grace asked.

"Five months."

Grace said, "It figures that your hot body wouldn't show at all. By this point in my pregnancy I looked like I had a watermelon under my shirt."

"Wait a minute," I said. "That's about when you left LA."

Krystal looked from me to Grace, then back to me again. "I haven't told you guys this, but do you remember Darryl?"

"Don't tell me..." Grace's voice trailed off.

Krystal nodded her head.

"Is that the guy you dated in high school?" I asked. "I thought he moved to Houston to work in an oil field or something."

"He did," Krystal said. "But he was back when I got back and I think I was feeling so lonely...it just happened. But please don't think I'm regretting this." She smiled. "I'm not. Not at all. I'm totally in love with him again."

Grace hugged Krystal. "I'm so happy for you." With her chin on Krystal's shoulder, Grace was looking directly at me, with an expression that would qualify as an "OMG" one.

Krystal turned to me. "Congratulations," I said, embracing her, giving Grace the same look she'd just given me.

I'm certain that Grace wasn't being nasty about Krystal's news, and I know damn well that I sure wasn't. For both of us, it was more along the lines of concern. With Krystal's recent heavy drug use, would the baby be okay?

My cell phone rang. I looked at the screen and saw that it was Jessica, my assistant. "I have to take this. Sorry."

As Krystal turned back to Grace and they chatted, I took the call from Jessica, who told me our financier, Jim Tames, wanted to speak ASAP.

Tames was a former top guy at Paramount who had started his own production company, then quickly sold it, and was now exclusively a finance guy. He had contacts all over town and when people needed money, they went to him and pitched their movie. He was an arrogant guy, I always hated dealing with him, but he had a lot of respect for Max's writing and was always willing to listen to us.

"Give me a second or two," I said. "I'm in the mall and need to get outside." It was too loud inside to take an important call like this, so I trudged through the mass of people, shopping bags hitting my legs with each step, and finally got outside onto the sidewalk. "Okay, go ahead."

"I'll put him through," she said, and I waited a couple of seconds until she said, "Ms. Rowland?"

"I'm here," I said.

"Mr. Tames?" Jessica said.

"I'm here."

"Thanks, Jessica," I said. "Jim, what's up?"

"Olivia, we have a problem."

"What's that?"

"Randall's pulling out."

"Shit."

He was talking about Scott Randall, the director, who had agreed to do Max's film, A Disputed Life.

"Shit is right," Tames said. "I have to tell you, Olivia, this makes me very nervous. We're 40 days out from shooting. And, by the way, why can't I get Max on the phone?"

"I'm sorry," I said. "I know he's at his mother's house. Maybe he's turned off his phone. I haven't talked to him in a day or so, either."

That wasn't true. I had talked to him, and I knew Max wasn't taking any business calls for a few days. As much as a micromanager as Tames was, Max probably figured the call wasn't that important.

"So what is Randall blowing us off for?" I asked.

"A cable mini-series," Jim said.

"Please tell me you're joking."

"Nope. They've greenlit two seasons in advance. They want the first four episodes shot earlier than they thought."

"So it's not something he arranged prior to agreeing to do the movie with us."

"Right," Jim said.

"Then there's really no conflict. He's just blowing us off, pushing Max's project to the back burner." I was getting pissed, feeling more defensive of Max's work - and his professional reputation - than I'd had to deal with so far. "You know what? If he's that uncommitted to Max's screenplay, then we wouldn't want him anyway. I'm going to call you later this afternoon and we'll straighten this out."

"I was wrong about 40 days until shooting," Jim said. "It's actually 39."

"I'll get on it," I assured him.

I hung up and went back inside the mall to Grace and Krystal.

Grace first noticed the look on my face. "What's wrong?"

"Work problems," I said. "I'll handle it later." I smiled and hooked my arm around Krystal's. "Let's go eat and talk more about this baby."

NINE

Two days after Christmas, I was packing my bags early in the morning when my parents came into the bedroom.

"Need any help?" my mother asked.

"No, I got it, thanks."

They sat on the bed and after about twenty seconds of silence, my dad said, "Olivia, we're really happy you came home for Christmas."

I was kneeling on the floor, folding some clothes. I looked up at him. "Me, too." I managed to get the words out in a sincere tone because I truly was glad that I had gone to their house for Christmas, but not for the reasons they probably thought. No, I was glad because the trip had solidified in me a resolve to shed any guilt or shame I had about the choices I'd made for myself.

Mom moved off the bed and sat down beside me, putting her arm around my shoulders. "We just want what's best for you."

I finished folding the shirt and added it to the stack of other ones. Sighing, I said, "We've been over this so many times. It's really exhausting."

"We'd hate to see you end up like Krystal," Dad said.

I felt a furious burning growing inside me suddenly. I looked up at the ceiling, then back down at him. "Really? You're comparing me to Krystal now?"

"No," my dad said, "it's just an examp - "

"It's not just an example," I interrupted. "You're clearly worried about that. And, by the way, which part? The drugs? Porn? Her getting pregnant?"

My mom looked shocked.

"That's right," I said, "she's pregnant. And it didn't happen in LA. It happened right here, in this upstanding, conservative, moral town of ours. You know, the same place my ex-boyfriend came from? The one who very well might have killed both Krystal and me if I hadn't defended myself? You guys have the wrong idea about me, about LA, about Max...everything. Let me show you something."

I opened the side pocket of my suitcase and took out Max's baby spoon.

"This," I said, "is what his mother gave me for Christmas. And you know why? Because she said she knows that I'm the one for Max and she wanted me to have this so when we're married and have a child, something from his childhood will carry on."

My mother was much more into the spoon than my dad was. Maybe just due to men not being into things like that as much as women are. I don't know. And, frankly, I didn't really care. I was making my point, standing firm, letting them know I had things under control.

I said, "The last couple of days, you guys have asked me twice about my work and you seem fine with that. Actually, Dad, you even seemed impressed. I can handle my personal life just like I handle my professional one. I'm not the vulnerable Olivia you guys think I am...or maybe even want me to be."

"We don't want you to be anything other than what you want to be," my mother said.

I looked at her, my eyes widening. "Then trust me. Support me. This is all going to be fine."

.........<br/>

Max put his right hand on my thigh, as his left hand kept the wheel steady. He gave my leg a light but reassuring squeeze. "Sorry."

"I'm just glad to be home." Then I paused. "Home. It feels good to say that."

"You were brilliant," Max said, as I opened the driver's side door of my new car and sat down. He got in the passenger seat.

"It wasn't just me," I said. "It was Lyle's idea."

"Yeah, well, you were still brilliant in talking me into it. But I'm not sure how brilliant it is that we're sitting in your new car with no clothes on."

I looked over at him. "Fuck it. These windows are tinted. Let's go for a ride."

"Naked..."

"Relax," I said, then gave him one of his own lines: "I've got this."

I suppose some of it had to do with having just been around Grace and also hearing Krystal's news, but more of it was coming from the talk I'd had with Max's mom right before Christmas.

I'm talking about the drastic change in my attitude toward what I wanted in life, specifically as it relates to marriage and family.

For the longest time, I rejected the idea out of hand. It wasn't for me. I wanted my career, wanted it badly, so badly in fact that the mere idea of starting a family was the equivalent of throwing up a roadblock on my pathway to being a successful woman in the movie industry.

Now, though, things were starting to look a little different through this new prism provided by Paula, Grace and, strange as it was, Krystal. Who would have ever thought Krystal would be in a position that I found enviable?

My thoughts only intensified the next time Max and I had our friends over for dinner.

It was a week before the Oscars, the first ever that I would be attending. Max wasn't up for any awards, nor was he presenting, so it would be a night of pure stress-free enjoyment and partying afterwards.

As the six of us sat around the dinner table, my head was on a swivel, listening to everyone else trading stories about their first time at the Academy Awards.

"I can understand Carl going, but I still can't believe they let in a reality TV producer," Max teased, glancing at Anthony.

"Hey," Anthony replied, "this is the future of television."

Max held up his beer mug. "Right. Big difference between an Emmy and Oscar gold, my friend."

Anthony laughed. "Neither one is pure gold."

"True," Max said.

"Plus, there's much more work that goes into a reality show than a movie. Just think of the script size differences. You work with a hundred and twenty pages or so. Hell, I shoot that every week."

They were just teasing each other, I knew. Both of them had major respect for the other's work. This was just men being men, I supposed.

"Wait," I said, a little hesitant to ask, but curious enough to do it. "There are scripts for reality shows?"

Monica said, "Not exactly. Anthony stretches the truth a little."

"Okay," Anthony said, "so they're more like outlines. Not really scripts. You've seen who's on those shows. Surely you don't think they're bright enough to memorize lines."

I nodded. "Gotcha."

"And please tell me you were also stretching the truth when you said it's the future of TV," Loralei said.

"God, please say it isn't so," I agreed.

Anthony wiped his mouth with his napkin. "Maybe the short-term future. There's a ton of cash in it, but let's face it, viewers are getting tired of these people. Yes, they work for me and they're raking in ad money hand over fist, but they're talentless bores, if you want to know the truth."

Carl said, "As an attorney who represents some of your, uh, stars, I have to object to that generalization."

"You saying it isn't true?" Max asked with a grin.

Carl put both hands up, surrendering. "I'm just objecting. It's neither my job nor within my capability to pass judgment on what's true and what isn't."

Max and Anthony said, simultaneously: "Lawyer-speak."

.........<br/>

Max kissed me harder, deeper, as if he hadn't seen me in weeks. I actually felt the same way.

Finally, he stopped just long enough to say, "I told him it wasn't for sale."

I smiled, happy that Max would still be controlling the film. "Nice. Way to smack him down before he even makes an offer."

"Oh, he made an offer," Max said, slipping off his coat. "But I turned it down. We're making this movie and I'm directing. I'm not giving this up."

"Well, just out of curiosity, how much did he offer?"

"Ten," he said. "And that's million, not thousand."

"Well, I kind of figured it wasn't ten thousand, but...Ten million? For just some script?"

Max looked at me out of the corner of his eye.

I couldn't keep a straight face any longer.

He made a quick move toward me and I ran, up the stairs, with Max chasing me, saying I was going to pay for that comment.

Not that I minded paying the price he demanded....

"He called me," Max said. "I spoke to him on the drive in from the airport. I guess he couldn't wait for me to get back to him."

Max picked me up in his arms and resumed kissing me hungrily.

"Wait," I said. "So what happened?"

Max shrugged. "He wants to buy the script."

"I know, but what did you say?"

Max kissed me harder, deeper, as if he hadn't seen me in weeks. I actually felt the same way.

Finally, he stopped just long enough to say, "I told him it wasn't for sale."

ELEVEN

Two weeks later, on what was inarguably the biggest Sunday of my life, I found myself being dressed by two stylists Max had surprised me with. I had initially planned to spend most of the morning and early afternoon out, getting my hair and makeup done, but the two women showed up shortly after 10 a.m.

Honestly, it was a bit much. Max had surprised me yet again. I'm not sure why, though. You'd think by now I would have been used to the way he did things - always going all out, over the top, never sparing effort or expense. I can't honestly say that I wanted to come to expect the things he did. It was part of what made life with him so invigorating.

I wasn't exactly nervous about the evening, but I didn't want to let Max down. I had been to that one movie premier in New York City many months ago - another surprise of Max's - and it had the red carpet and the stars and press it warranted. But that was nothing compared to the Academy Awards.

When Max saw me walk out of the bedroom, he eyed me up and down. I had on a white dress, and he wore a tux with the bowtie hanging from his neck.

All that was missing on me was the veil, and I suddenly had a rush of that odd emotion I'd been feeling more and more lately. Is this what it would feel like on my wedding day?

I also briefly regretted the choice of a white dress. It wasn't a wedding gown by any stretch of the imagination, but the coincidence was enough to make me rethink it. Too late.

"You look like a movie star."

"Ha ha," I said, with heavy sarcasm. "Right."

He stepped toward me and put his arm around my waist. "If we had more time - "

"Mr. Dalton?" We heard the voice from outside. It was the limo, ready to take us from Malibu to downtown LA, and The Dolby Theater on Hollywood Boulevard.

When we arrived, there was a line of limos backed up, sort of like you'd see during a delay with airplanes on the runway.

Thankfully, the limo was stocked with wine and beer, cold shrimp and some cheese. I had wine, Max had a beer. He offered me a shrimp, but I declined.

"It'll mess up my lipstick or I'll have a fleck of shrimp meat stuck in my teeth."

Max put the whole thing in his mouth and said, "It's going to be hours before we eat."

I looked at him, having never seen him talk with his mouth full before, and he smiled - luckily with his lips pressed together. I realized he was trying to make me laugh and relax me as much as he could.

He sipped his beer and said, "You're gorgeous, Liv. And if we're lucky, Jennifer Lawrence or Johnny Depp will be right in front or behind us, and we'll only be blurry images in the background of one of their shots." He stroked my knee. "Where's that confident woman who runs my professional life so well?"

He leaned in toward my face.

I stopped him. "Lipstick. Don't. Plus you're all...shrimpy-breath."

Max laughed and reached for another.

Fifteen minutes later, stepping out of the limo, I realized that the flash of paparazzi is something I can't imagine ever getting used to. It had happened at that premier in NYC, even though they were snapping shots of real celebs. This time, though, it seemed like they were photographers getting paid by the picture.

I smiled as Max took my hand and we made our way down the carpet. In no time, the cameras turned to the next limo behind us. Just as Max had predicted, it was a big celebrity - Sandra Bullock - and our five seconds of attention were over.

A loud cheer went up from the people who had gathered in the bleachers to get a glimpse of Hollywood "royalty."

That is, until someone from the rope-line was calling Max's name. It was a reporter from Variety, and Max graciously walked over to her and gave her a few minutes, during which he answered a few questions about the new film and how things were going with him taking over the director's role.

"Fantastic," he said, "and I owe it all to Olivia Rowland." He turned and smiled at me.

The reporter looked at me and tried not to look confused, though I'm sure she was. She asked how to spell my last name, and what my job was.

"R-O-W-L-A-N-D," Max said. "And her job... She runs my life." Tugging my hand, he returned us to the procession toward the doors.

More whoops and screams came from the bleachers. They weren't for us, but I have to admit - for a moment, I pretended they were.

.........<br/>

We talked for a few moments about the winners, and which one of us had picked the correct winner for Best Picture. Max got that one right, while I had managed to win the Best Actor and Best Actress guesses.

The limo hadn't moved. There was obviously a traffic jam due to all of the other limos, and probably more so due to people taking their sweet time getting to their rides.

But soon we were on the way.

"How long is the ride?" I asked.

Max said, "Hungry?"

I laughed. "No. Well, yeah, I kind of am. I'm just wondering if we have a few minutes."

"For?"

I didn't answer verbally. Instead I lowered my head to his lap and pressed my lips against his cock, feeling him grow instantly harder. I lightly nibbled at his erection through his pants.

The privacy shade was up, so the driver had no view of the back of the limo. I wasn't sure if I was going to take full advantage of that, though, and unzip Max's pants and free him into my mouth.

So instead I decided to keep doing what I was doing. With my hand, I squeezed his pants around the bulge of his length and traced the outline of the tip.

I kissed it there, then managed to lift his cock up a little bit, just enough to take the tip into my mouth and breathe hot air through his slacks.

"Tease," he said.

"Mmm hmm," I replied with my mouthful.

By his physiological reaction, I know Max was enjoying my teasing play, but he suddenly put his hand on my head, lightly turning it to face him, and said, "Liv, let's save that for later."

I lifted my head. "What's wrong?"

I felt the limo coming to a stop as I looked out the window and realized that we were not in front of the Beverly Hilton.

"Nothing," he said, pulled me up to his face. "Nothing at all." He kissed me deeply, his tongue sweeping through my mouth, arousing me more than I already had been. "Come with me."

Max opened the door, stepped out and turned around to take my hand as I exited the limo. "Where are we?"

The heels I was wearing weren't the best for trying to stand on the gravel, but I managed as I turned around to discover we were at the top of Mount Lee, where the Hollywood sign overlooks Los Angeles.

The view from the top of the hill was amazing - a million twinkling lights, like looking at a constellation of stars, in more ways than one.

Max held me from behind, squeezing me tightly, kissing my neck. "I haven't been up here in a long time."

"When was the last time?"

He nibbled my earlobe. "Shortly after I first got here. I had to sneak up here, of course, and risk getting arrested, but it was worth it."

"Sneak? You couldn't drive up here then?"

"You could," he said, "but not where we're going." As we started to walk, the driver popped the trunk and Max reached in, pulling out my sneakers. "You'll be more comfortable in these," he said.

I leaned on the car as he changed my shoes for me, then we walked down a short few steps to a gate, where I saw a sign that read: "Restricted Access. No hiking to the Hollywood sign," followed with threats of prosecution, jail time and fines.

A man was standing there, and he greeted Max. "Good night so far?"

"Hey, Todd. Great night so far. Give us maybe thirty minutes," Max said.

"Take your time. I'll be in the truck."

We walked through the gate and I asked Max who that was.

"Someone I know. LAFD guy."

"You have contacts in the Fire Department?" I said, incredulously.

"I hired him as a technical advisor on a movie. I paid him tonight, too, and that cost me more than the fine, but saves us from having to see our mug shots on the Internet."

We ended up sitting on the edge of one of the letter L's.

"If you think I'm going to finish that blowjob on the Hollywood sign," I said, "you have a more active imagination than I thought."

Max laughed and pulled me closer to him. "I'll let you finish it later."

"How generous of you." I looked up at his face, searching for his reaction to my sarcasm, but only saw him gazing out over the city. "What, you didn't like my joke?"

He continued to look out toward the city. "I did."

"You didn't laugh. Didn't even crack a smile. What's up? Something on your mind?"

"Everything we're looking at right now. The thousands of people down there scurrying from one after-party to the next, desperately trying to shoulder their way into a conversation they think will change their lives forever, the glee of the winners, the letdown for others...I love it all. It's what I dreamed of being a part of my whole life."

"And here you are," I said. "You made it."

He nodded. "I did. I mean, I don't have a golden statuette - "

"Yet," I added.

"Right," he said. "Yet. But I'm doing what I always wanted to do. Living the dream. But it's not enough. Not nearly enough. Someday I know people will remember who I was and the work that I did."

"Of course they will," I said, detecting a note of sadness in his tone. "You know, you're a little too young to be worrying about your legacy."

"That's not what I'm worried about. Actually, I'm not worried about anything." He shifted, and at the same time he moved me so we were sitting facing each other. "I'm doing what I always wanted to do, and for the most part I've already done it. I know the game. And that's exactly what it is. A game. One I know how to play."

His eyes were darting back and forth, searching mine. Wherever he was going with this, I was feeling like the point was escaping me.

"Liv," he said, taking my hands in his. "The only important thing to me...is you." He pulled a ringbox out of his pocket and held it in front of me, unopened, as he continued to speak. "I can't imagine the rest of my life without you by my side, and if you give me the chance, I'll prove that to you every day. Marry me."

"I can't imagine the rest of my life without you by my side, and if you give me the chance, I'll prove that to you every day. Marry me."

TWELVE

Max and I drove to his mother's house the next afternoon.

"Let's see how long it takes her to notice the ring," Max said as he drove.

"What? That's not nice. What if she doesn't notice and feels bad?"

"Oh, she'll see it."

It was a gorgeous day, so Max had put the top down on his Porsche. He wore jeans and a black button-down shirt, untucked. Sometimes I couldn't decide if he was sexier in casual clothing or something more formal, but I always came back to the conclusion that anything he wore was sexy, because his delicious body was waiting for me underneath.

I had to snap out of my sexual reverie as we approached his mother's house, and I did so by turning my thoughts to the excitement of telling her we were getting married. Surely it had to go better than the way my parents sounded when I called.

She was waiting on the front porch as Max pulled into the driveway, and came down the steps to meet us as we got out of the car. She kissed and hugged Max first, then turned around for me after I walked over to the driver's side of the car, dodging the dogs as I did so.

When we pulled away from each other, her hair caught on my ring. It was a comical scene for a moment, as she went from surprise and a quick shout of "Ooh!" to a big smile and a few tears while she looked from the ring to me, then to Max and back to the ring again.

"Well, that's one way to surprise her," Max said.

"I swear I didn't plan that, Paula."

She laughed and hugged me again. "I know you didn't, sweetie, but I wouldn't have cared if you did."

Over lunch, Paula insisted on knowing every detail of the proposal, and Max let me tell the story.

"Nice touch," she said to him, when I was finished.

"I thought so, too," he said.

"But there's more," I said. "Remember when Max went to Maine for a location scouting?"

Paula nodded. "Just the one night, right before the Oscars."

"Right," I said. "Well, it turns out he didn't go to Maine after all. He went to Ohio and talked to my parents."

"Wow, Max," Paula said, turning her head in his direction. "Quite the traditionalist."

"Not really," he said. "Olivia's parents haven't been my biggest fan, so that's the only reason I did it."

"It's true." I shifted in my seat. This topic still made me uncomfortable. "They always had this view of my life that was more like theirs. Well, you know what I mean, Paula."

She nodded her head. "I grew up the same way. Listen, I wish I'd had your opportunities and your gumption, Olivia. I admire you."

I felt bad now, watching Paula's face drop to an expressionless mask as she no doubt felt regret about how her life had gone.

Max lifted his hands, palms up. "Wait a minute." He looked at me, then at his mother, a smile spreading across his face. "If you had been able to go off and do...whatever it was you wanted to do, you wouldn't have had me."

Paula reached out and put her hand on his forearm. "I didn't mean it that way."

Max lifted his drink. "Jesus, I might just have to write that script based on our family, after all."

Paula finally went back to looking happy. "You wouldn't dare."

Max put his glass down. "Never."

It was a tense topic, yet they handled it with ease and humor. I wish things with my parents had been like that.

"So your parents," Paula said, looking over to me. "I take it they don't approve."

I shook my head and told her how it went down.

.........<br/>

"Absolutely. As long as you promise we don't talk about any of this anymore. At least until I'm ready."

"Deal."

.........<br/>

"Has she seen him?"

Max shook his head and pressed the fingertips of both hands to his temples. "No."

"Do you believe her?"

He nodded. "I cross-examined her big time on that. Jesus, I can't fucking believe this."

I curled my arm around his. "How did this start? What are they talking about?"

"He called her out of the blue one day. She said they fell right into talking about the past. About me, about their teenage years, their honeymoon. I guess all the good stuff they remember. All the stuff that happened...before."

"Reminiscing," I said.

"And in denial," Max added, sharply.

"Maybe the loneliness will subside and she'll stop talking to him."

He turned to me and took me in his arms, pulling me in close. "I'm sorry I tried to smooth things over with your family."

"What do you mean?"

"It wasn't my place," he said quietly, his chin resting on my shoulder as we sat in an embrace. "Some things are just unfixable."

My eyes welled up. It was the truth. A very sad one.

"You try too hard," I said.

He pulled back from me. "At what?"

"At everything. And most of the time it works out for you. But you can't make people do things in real life like you can make them do on the page. That's why you became a writer in the first place." I shrugged. "So, now this is just more evidence that you can't control what you can't control."

"Profound," he said, cracking a smile for the first time that day. "You're right. Anyway, we have too much work to concentrate on. That's the important thing. But I am having someone keep tabs on all of this. If he shows up or if she goes to him, I'll know about it."

Max told me that he had called Carl, figuring a lawyer could put him in touch with a good private investigator, and by the time Max got home, the deal was already in the works.

"And then what?" I asked. "What are you going to do if that happens?"

He thought about it for a moment. "I don't know. Maybe nothing."

It sounded to me like the only viable option.

TWELVE

Max and I drove to his mother's house the next afternoon.

"Let's see how long it takes her to notice the ring," Max said as he drove.

"What? That's not nice. What if she doesn't notice and feels bad?"

"Oh, she'll see it."

It was a gorgeous day, so Max had put the top down on his Porsche. He wore jeans and a black button-down shirt, untucked. Sometimes I couldn't decide if he was sexier in casual clothing or something more formal, but I always came back to the conclusion that anything he wore was sexy, because his delicious body was waiting for me underneath.

I had to snap out of my sexual reverie as we approached his mother's house, and I did so by turning my thoughts to the excitement of telling her we were getting married. Surely it had to go better than the way my parents sounded when I called.

She was waiting on the front porch as Max pulled into the driveway, and came down the steps to meet us as we got out of the car. She kissed and hugged Max first, then turned around for me after I walked over to the driver's side of the car, dodging the dogs as I did so.

When we pulled away from each other, her hair caught on my ring. It was a comical scene for a moment, as she went from surprise and a quick shout of "Ooh!" to a big smile and a few tears while she looked from the ring to me, then to Max and back to the ring again.

"Well, that's one way to surprise her," Max said.

"I swear I didn't plan that, Paula."

She laughed and hugged me again. "I know you didn't, sweetie, but I wouldn't have cared if you did."

Over lunch, Paula insisted on knowing every detail of the proposal, and Max let me tell the story.

"Nice touch," she said to him, when I was finished.

Paula reached out and put her hand on his forearm. "I didn't mean it that way."

Max lifted his drink. "Jesus, I might just have to write that script based on our family, after all."

Paula finally went back to looking happy. "You wouldn't dare."

Max put his glass down. "Never."

It was a tense topic, yet they handled it with ease and humor. I wish things with my parents had been like that.

"So your parents," Paula said, looking over to me. "I take it they don't approve."

I shook my head and told her how it went down.

.........<br/>

"We can't stop you, Olivia," my mother said, "but we think you're making a mistake. It's too soon."

I didn't say anything.

"We appreciate the fact that he came and spoke to us first," mom said, "but I hope he told you that your father did not give him his blessing."

"His blessing?" I said, incredulous. And then it just poured out of me: "It's 2013, not 1953. The only blessing we need is each other's, okay? It's a different world, you guys, and I'm living in it. This is my life, and I love Max. That alone should be good enough for you."

Was it harsh? Probably. But there was no way I could even pretend to play the part of the approval-seeking daughter. I was a grown woman. Educated. Determined. Successful. I had met a great man who was good to me, and who I loved more than I thought possible. I knew what I wanted and I knew who I wanted it with. The only power they had to hold me back was power that I gave them. And I refused to do so.

"Olivia," my father said, but I cut him off.

"No, wait. I'm not going to drag this out. We don't have a date yet, but if you're not talking to me by the time we set one, I'll let you know when it is. The rest is up to you. I have a busy day ahead. I need to get going. Please think about what you're doing."

There was silence on the other end of the line. Shock, no doubt.

"Goodbye," I said, not in a rude way, but definitely a determined one.

I was feeling strong, but weaker as the call ended. Luckily, as always, Max was there when I needed him. I felt his arms wrap around me from behind and I grabbed onto his forearms, lowered my head and cried softly.

.........<br/>

I found myself glancing around, making sure Max hadn't come back into the house yet. "Ah, Jesus. Hang on." I made my way upstairs, so at least I could hear the door and have time to end the call if I needed to.

I went to the far side of our bedroom, which was entirely glass and provided a complete view of the beach where the steps led up to our backyard - the way Max would surely come home.

"Okay," I said. "Tell me why."

"It's so hard."

"Just tell me."

"It's hard not to talk to him. He was my first love, my only love. He's changed. He's...calmer, low key. Just like he was when we met as teenagers. Something changed him for the worst. But, Olivia, he's had two heart attacks and survived them both. I loved him. I always did. The man I married went away for a while, for some reason. But he's back now. We're both much older... You wouldn't understand this, at least not yet, anyway - "

"Paula," I said, interrupting because she was thinking dangerously. "That may all be true. I have no doubt it's true, actually. But that's not the same man you fled from."

"But - "

I cut her off again. The one word she got out was carried on a tone of weakness and desperation, and it made me sad. "Paula, think of Max."

"I was hoping you would talk to him about it."

Now I was getting frustrated. She wasn't going to budge. That much was clear. "No."

"Please, Olivia, he'll listen to you."

"I'm sure he would," I said, "but I can't support you on this, Paula. I just can't."

"Then please keep this between you and me," she pleaded.

"That's not fair. I tell Max everything. Paula, listen to yourself. Do you really want to go backwards? You're doing so well. Max has made an incredible life for himself. And for you, I might add."

"Now that's none of your business."

"Actually, it is. And I'm sorry I have to be so blunt about this, but remember, you came to me with this. If you're just looking for someone to back you up, I'm sorry, but I can't do that. I know exactly how Max will take it, and so do you. I'm not going to be part of that. And I'm not going to lie to him."

She was silent, and I gave her about thirty seconds to speak, but she said nothing.

"Paula, think long and hard about this. And when you're ready to make the right decision, let me know. But if you need someone to talk to Max, that's going to have to be you. I have to tell him, but I'll give you a week to do it yourself."

And with that closing statement to the conversation, I had dealt with Max's mom just as I had dealt with my own parents - putting the ball in their court.

.........<br/>

"Olivia, I hear things are going well in development."

"Better than well," I said. "Great. Things are going great."

"That's...great."

"Do you need to speak with Max?" I asked. "I know he's in his car, so he should pick up."

"Not necessary. I know he's busy as hell. I wanted to get in touch with you to let you know I'm sending something over to your office."

"Oh yeah? Two-door or four-door?" I closed the browser on my iMac. I'd seen enough of Perez Hilton's site for one day.

Jim chuckled. "Right. Like a car would impress you, with your high-class lifestyle."

I ignored his little jab. "What are you sending, Jim?"

"My god-daughter."

I closed my eyes, knowing what was coming.

"She's great," he said. "And she doesn't need a big part. Just something with a couple of lines. It won't even come out of the budget. I'll pay her."

I leaned back in my chair and kept my eyes closed, concentrating on my breathing. I should have known there would be some catch to his offer to fully finance the movie. Max should have known, too. But neither of us had even considered it.

Jim continued, "I think she'd be great for the part of the hotel receptionist. That scene where the main character loses it in the lobby and the receptionist talks him down is great writing. The dialogue is just brilliant."

"I'll talk to Max," I told him.

Moments later, I had Max on the phone.

When I told him about the call I'd just had with Jim, Max said, "Done."

"What?"

"We'll do it, no problem."

"Max, we already have someone cast for that part."

He said that was true, but that we had other, somewhat smaller roles we could put that actress in, and make way for Jim's god-daughter. "It'll be easy. This happens all the time."

"Yeah, you don't sound surprised."

"I am, a little," Max said. "I'm surprised he waited this long. Must have been a last minute thing. But I knew he'd want some kind of favor. No big deal, Liv. We've got this."

The whole situation made me feel like I was still a little bit of a newbie, but at least I was learning now that favors were the real currency in Hollywood.

.........<br/>

He jiggled the door handle again.

"Still locked," I said. "One second..."

"I'll pee on one, too, if that makes you more comfortable."

I was nervous, for sure, but our conversation brought a little bit of comic relief to the moment.

"Done," I said, pulling my underwear up, my skirt down, and opening the door. "You can watch me wash my hands."

We stood there for a few moments, observing the indicator on the test stick.

When the result finally showed up, we both stared at it for a few moments, and then Max took me in his arms.

.........<br/>

I stood in the shade with my back up against the building, taking deep breaths and feeling a little better with each one.

"What's the matter?"

I opened my eyes and saw Max standing there.

"You were practically running out the door," he said, walking up to me and putting his hands on my arms.

"I just didn't feel well for a minute. But I'm feeling better now."

"What was it?"

"I don't know." I described the symptoms to him, and as I ticked off each one, it hit me. And I think it hit Max, too, judging by the look on his face.

We stared at each other for a moment, until finally he said, "I'll get Liz to run to the drugstore - "

"No, don't." I didn't want an assistant doing that. "I'll go myself."

"I'm going with you."

.........<br/>

"They do follow it," he said, "but they're just trying to kiss ass to get an exclusive."

I noticed that Max was keenly aware of this, and once, when a few true fans of one of his early actions movies spotted him and asked for autographs, Max signed them and spoke to the fans, completely ignoring the questions from the reporter. Who, by the way, was talking over the fans' questions, and Max got him to quiet down and back off. He knew who to give his attention to.

At Dan Tana's that night, Max let it slip that I was pregnant.

I got looks of shock all around the table.

"Nice going." I rolled my eyes.

We were several weeks in at that point, and everything was looking good so far from a medical perspective. So we were getting close to the point where we would start telling people anyway. I just hadn't planned on it at that time.

Our table got a little loud for a few minutes after Max's premature revelation - the guys congratulating Max, the girls smiling and tearing up along with me, glasses were raised, hugs and handshakes all around.

"I wondered why you were drinking sparkling water," Loralei said to me.

"Yeah, I kind of thought that would give it away."

Monica said, "Okay, so we need to start planning the first shower, like now. Oh, I can't wait. You and Max are going to have the most beautiful baby."

"Don't let our kids hear that," Anthony said. "They'd be crushed."

"If they took out their earbuds long enough to hear us," Monica said.

"It's not that bad, is it?" Carl asked.

Monica rolled her eyes. "Not quite, but almost."

"There's an idea for a reality TV show," Anthony said. "Put a bunch of kids in a house - sort of like Big Brother - and the one who can hold out the longest without using their phone or tablet gets a million bucks." His mind was always working, like Max's, looking for new ideas, so while we all laughed we also all knew he was only half-joking.

"Why kids?" Max said. "We're all addicted to those things."

"Not me," Loralei said.

Carl huffed. "Right. Your hands are on your iPhone more than they're on me." He looked around at all of us. "Why do you think we don't have kids?"

We all laughed.

Loralei was smiling, but she said, "Don't expect any action tonight."

Max and Anthony both groaned.

Max ordered everyone another round of drinks, and a soda for me. Not diet, either. I wasn't denying myself those simple pleasures. In fact, as the night progressed, my focus gradually shifted from the company of friends to the enticing dessert menu, and when the waiter asked if we wanted dessert, I ordered a chocolate and vanilla parfait topped off with strawberries. For two. And I ate the whole thing. Screw it.

Later, just before we left, Steven Spielberg and his wife approached our table to say hello to Max. Minutes after that, Max introduced me to Russell Crowe, who said he and Max needed to get together and talk about a project.

I'd long since ceased becoming star-struck. Not that it wasn't a thrill to mix and mingle with the biggest names in Hollywood. But rather I was starting to feel like I really belonged.

FOURTEEN

I was running on the beach one morning when the music stopped pumping through my earbuds because I was getting a call. It was Grace.

"Krystal had a girl."

"That's great."

"Why are you out of breath?"

"I was running," I said. "How's Krystal's baby?"

"She's fine. No sign of any trouble."

It went unspoken, but we were referring to the possibility of Krystal's baby having problems related to Krystal's drug use. The timing told us everything would probably be okay, but you never know.

I had slowed down to a walk and when I got back to the steps that lead from the beach up to our house, I sat down on the first one and stretched. "So what's the name?"

"Ginger. I'll send you a picture of her. Wait until you see this red hair."

Off in the distance, a guy worked a kite in the wind. A few people were surfing, but having little luck due to the unusually calm waves. Gulls skittered where the waves broke, looking for lunch, and oddly reminding me I needed to do the same.

As I sat on the wooden steps leading up from the beach to our house, there was a heaviness in my gut that had nothing to do with being pregnant. It was guilt. I was keeping some of the biggest developments in my life from Grace, probably the one person on the planet - other than Max, of course - who I wanted to know about this. But I had good reason to keep it to myself as long as I could. It was the same situation as the marriage - I knew what I wanted in life and I knew I was strong enough to have it; but there were a few unfortunate but temporary casualties along the way.

We exchanged some small talk for a few minutes before I told her I needed to get ready, grab something to eat, and get to the office.

Later, I showed the picture of Krystal's baby to Max.

"Beautiful," he said.

"She really is. She looks just like Krystal."

We were at the offices of OliviMax, watching dailies from the shoot. It was a part of the movie industry that I found fascinating, mostly because of how raw the footage was. I looked forward to watching it go from that to a highly-produced and stylized final version, complete with different angles edited in the shot and whatever background music we selected for the various scenes.

"Do you want a girl or a boy?" I asked him.

He looked at me with a straight face. "Why? Can you control that?"

"Yes, actually I can," I joked back.

He took my hand, lifted it to his face, kissed it and said, "Surprise me."

.........<br/>

"They do follow it," he said, "but they're just trying to kiss ass to get an exclusive."

I noticed that Max was keenly aware of this, and once, when a few true fans of one of his early actions movies spotted him and asked for autographs, Max signed them and spoke to the fans, completely ignoring the questions from the reporter.

I'd long since ceased becoming star-struck. Not that it wasn't a thrill to mix and mingle with the biggest names in Hollywood. But rather I was starting to feel like I really belonged.

FIFTEEN

About halfway through my second trimester, I was really starting to show and was becoming a little obsessed with it.

I was spending almost as much time buying new clothes as I was doing my job on the film. Max had no problem with me doing whatever I wanted, and since a lot of my work could be handled over the phone - problem solving and such - it didn't matter if I was on the set or browsing in a store somewhere trying to find the perfect shirt that would hide my growing baby-bump.

More troubling, though, was the sex between Max and I. There was something decidedly different about it. For one thing it had decreased in frequency. But when we did have sex, he didn't seem as into it as much as he always was - especially when compared with how he had been in the months before we found out I was pregnant.

I had noticed it with increasing clarity over the last couple of weeks, and it coincided with the time my body was noticeably changing.

At first, I decided to stop feeling sorry for myself. But then that resolve to just deal with it turned to a little bit of anger. Frustration, at least.

And that's how I was feeling one day when I was trying on some new clothes in front of the tri-fold mirror in my large walk-in closet. I had gone through a few skirts and pairs of slacks, along with a few shirts, and I didn't like any of them.

I was between outfits, trying to decide which to try next, standing there in my bra and panties, when I started to cry. Not sobbing, but just feeling a little overwhelmed by all of this. And I'm sure the hormonal changes had something to do with it, as well.

"What's wrong?"

I was startled by Max's voice and as I turned toward the door to see him, I reflexively threw one arm up across my bra and dropped my other hand down in front of my panties.

Max looked simultaneously worried and amused by my reaction.

"Olivia," he said, moving toward me. "What's the matter?"

He wrapped his arms around me and drew me in close to him.

My forehead fell to his chest and I continued to sob lightly.

"Talk to me," he said.

He put a finger under my chin and lifted my face, looking into my eyes.

"Are you not attracted to me?" I asked.

His brow furrowed and his head tilted to the side. "What? Why would you think that?"

"You're not...it's not the same."

Max put his hand on the side of my face and with his thumb he wiped away a tear rolling down my cheek. "What's not?"

I exhaled heavily. "When we make love."

He slowly shook his head. "No, no. That's not it at all. I just want to be gentle with you." He smiled. His hand drifted down the front of my body, finally coming to a stop as his palm rested on my belly. "You're as gorgeous as always."

I raised up on my tiptoes for a kiss.

Max wrapped his arms around me again and held me close, not letting our lips separate. Then he lifted me off the ground, and a few steps later, out in the bedroom, he was laying me on my back.

"I don't want you to be different with this," I said, looking up at the ceiling.

Max was kissing my neck, then the upper part of my chest. I looked down and watched as his tongue traced the edge of my bra over my plump breast.

He looked up at me. "I lust for every inch of your body, and I'm going show you."

I arched my back so he could unclasp my bra, and he tossed it off the bed. He lowered his head, and traced circles around my left nipple, then my right, then back to the left one where he opened his mouth wide and sealed his lips around it, sucking it into his mouth.

Since becoming pregnant, my nipples were hypersensitive, and Max was clearly picking up on that fact, giving them more time and attention than he ever had. I squirmed beneath him as the sensation radiated from my breasts to all of my extremities.

I could have stayed there for hours as the tortuous pleasure engulfed me, but Max had other ideas.

Gently, he turned me onto my side, his tongue never leaving my skin, sliding along my side, then to my back as he positioned me onto my stomach.

I felt his soft, warm kisses on the middle of my back. Then higher, between my shoulder blades, and higher still, to the back of my neck as he swept my hair off to the side.

As he made a trail of soft kisses down my spine, he hooked his fingers inside the waistband of my panties.

Moving his mouth down lower to the small of my back, then to the curve of my ass, he slipped the underwear down my legs, following down the back of my right leg, kissing and licking along the way.

Then to my left ankle, and back up my left leg, slowing as he neared the top, then surprising me by biting me lightly on the cheek of my ass.

Max turned me onto my side, facing him. His head was still near my waist. He lifted my leg and brought it to his face, kissing the inside of my thigh, then moving farther up.

Rolling me over onto my back, he said, "I'll never get enough of you, Liv."

His tongue dragged up my thigh, just passing by my sex, and coming to a stop on my inner hip, where he kissed it and looked up at me.

A few quick, teasing licks of my clit. My hips rocked upward, reacting to his tongue. With one hand on each of my thighs, he spread my legs wider.

I thought he was about to make me come with his mouth, but he moved. He knelt between my legs and swiftly pulled his shirt off.

He then unbuckled his belt, lowered his zipper and let his pants fall to his knees, then pushed his underwear down.

I watched his fully erect cock spring free of the constraint of his boxer briefs, and his hand was immediately wrapped around his shaft.

He stroked himself, from base to tip, letting his thumb glide over the swell of the head, picking up the little bubble of moisture that had gathered there. He spread the silky precome around the head of his cock, and I could see it glistening from the lamplight.

Even after countless times being with Max, I still marveled at the sight of him naked - the way his muscles flexed and rippled under his taut skin.

"You're gorgeous, Liv, and it's been a while since I've fucked you like I should."

His voice was deep and like a breathy rumble, and the way he matter-of-factly announced what he was going to do to me almost made me beg for it.

But I didn't have to.

I felt the weight of his cock resting just above my sex as he leaned down to kiss me on the lips. His erection seemed to be radiating heat as it lay against my clit.

One slight shift, and the head of his cock penetrated me. Then another push, and he was inside.

"You're so wet," he said, tilting his hips left, then right, settling himself deep inside me.

He was going slow now. With each thrust in, he did that squeezing thing, making his thick erection swell even more.

I wanted this badly, and he was deliberately drawing it out to a tease. I tried to shift my weight and roll him over so I could ride him.

The corner of his mouth curled up into a half-grin as he grabbed my wrist, holding me firmly on my back.

"Trying to get on offense?"

"Yes. I need it," I said.

He shook his head, adding a frown for effect. "Sorry, but you're on defense from now on. No more offense for you."

Max was tonguing my nipples again and doing that light biting thing that always drove me wild.

"You don't think I can get on offense?" I said.

Without moving his head, he shifted his gaze to meet my eyes. "No."

"Really?"

"Yes," he said, and thrust his cock harder into me. "Really."

God, he was tempting me. Testing me.

I locked a leg around his and tried to flip over once more.

"No dice," he said, his hips now moving in a rolling motion - side to side and back and forth - as he fucked me harder.

His eyes bore a hole through mine. The intense, possessive, controlling stare only made me want to ride him more.

I tried again.

"You want this," he said.

"I want to be on offense."

My breath hitched as his cock penetrated me all the way to the hilt. I was wet and warm, but I could feel how hot his cock was, like steel sheathed in satin against my aching core.

"Fine," he said, "but I'm still calling the plays."

And he flipped us over, his erection staying inside me.

He raised his knees slightly.

"Lock your legs with mine," he breathed.

I did just as he said.

I was bent over slightly and in his gravelly, low voice he told me to sit straight up. "I want to watch as much as I can while you ride it."

I sat up as he told me to and he placed his hands on my thighs.

Once again I felt impaled on his length.

I started to slide up along his cock by pushing up with my legs.

With his hands on my legs, though, he stopped me.

I looked down at his stone cold expression.

He said, "You'll get to do it your way in a minute. But now you do it how I want it."

Fuck. He was teasing me again, and testing me. And I loved every second of it.

"Roll your hips like I was," he said.

I moved them in a gyrating motion, and felt his cock burying deeper as I did so. Around and around in a circular motion, then switching direction.

I put my hands on his firm stomach to steady myself. I threw my head back.

Then I felt his thumb on my clit, moving in its own circular motion.

I wasn't going to last long, and as it became obvious - through my breathing and the way my hip movements were starting to jerk - Max's thumb retreated.

I had been on the verge of coming, and he had stopped it.

"Not cool," I said.

His eyebrows rose and fell quickly. "This is how I want you to come."

"This isn't exactly offense," I said.

"You need to come."

"Yes."

"Tell me, Liv. Beg me."

"I want to come so bad. Please." I don't think I'd ever begged for anything this much in my life, and it left me feeling totally at his mercy, which only made me want it more.

"How do you want to come?" he asked. "You want to ride it? Bounce on it?"

"Yes, yes..."

His hands had been on my thighs again, preventing me from moving up and down, allowing only that gyration movement.

But then he lifted his hands, freeing me.

I almost didn't wait, but it was only a second before he said, "Do it, Olivia. Come all over my cock."

I slid up his cock, then back down fast, bumping against him...and then I couldn't stop.

Max was kneading my breasts and rolling my nipples between his thumbs and forefingers, pulling on them.

His hips bucked me up and down harder and I felt the head of his penis strike me deeper than ever before as I clenched around his shaft.

I exhaled heavily, not even having realized I had been holding my breath. All of my concentration was on our movements and the way he was fucking me from underneath.

"I can't get enough of you, Liv."

"I can't get enough of your cock. Fuck me, fuck me..." I blurted.

Max's upward thrusts grew stronger as I moved my hips up and down, riding him as fast as my body could take it.

"Come on my cock," he repeated, and it was all the urging I needed.

I cried out a yelp, took in a deep breath, and started to come just as I felt his silken release inside me.

FIFTEEN

About halfway through my second trimester, I was really starting to show and was becoming a little obsessed with it.

I was spending almost as much time buying new clothes as I was doing my job on the film. Max had no problem with me doing whatever I wanted, and since a lot of my work could be handled over the phone - problem solving and such - it didn't matter if I was on the set or browsing in a store somewhere trying to find the perfect shirt that would hide my growing baby-bump.

More troubling, though, was the sex between Max and I. There was something decidedly different about it. For one thing it had decreased in frequency. But when we did have sex, he didn't seem as into it as much as he always was - especially when compared with how he had been in the months before we found out I was pregnant.

I had noticed it with increasing clarity over the last couple of weeks, and it coincided with the time my body was noticeably changing.

At first, I decided to stop feeling sorry for myself. But then that resolve to just deal with it turned to a little bit of anger. Frustration, at least.

And that's how I was feeling one day when I was trying on some new clothes in front of the tri-fold mirror in my large walk-in closet. I had gone through a few skirts and pairs of slacks, along with a few shirts, and I didn't like any of them.

I was between outfits, trying to decide which to try next, standing there in my bra and panties, when I started to cry. Not sobbing, but just feeling a little overwhelmed by all of this. And I'm sure the hormonal changes had something to do with it, as well.

"What's wrong?"

I was startled by Max's voice and as I turned toward the door to see him, I reflexively threw one arm up across my bra and dropped my other hand down in front of my panties.

Max looked simultaneously worried and amused by my reaction.

"Olivia," he said, moving toward me. "What's the matter?"

He wrapped his arms around me and drew me in close to him.

My forehead fell to his chest and I continued to sob lightly.

"Talk to me," he said.

He put a finger under my chin and lifted my face, looking into my eyes.

"Are you not attracted to me?" I asked.

His brow furrowed and his head tilted to the side. "What? Why would you think that?"

"You're not...it's not the same."

Max put his hand on the side of my face and with his thumb he wiped away a tear rolling down my cheek. "What's not?"

I exhaled heavily. "When we make love."

He slowly shook his head. "No, no. That's not it at all. I just want to be gentle with you." He smiled. His hand drifted down the front of my body, finally coming to a stop as his palm rested on my belly. "You're as gorgeous as always."

I raised up on my tiptoes for a kiss.

Max wrapped his arms around me again and held me close, not letting our lips separate. Then he lifted me off the ground, and a few steps later, out in the bedroom, he was laying me on my back.

"I don't want you to be different with this," I said, looking up at the ceiling.

Max was kissing my neck, then the upper part of my chest. I looked down and watched as his tongue traced the edge of my bra over my plump breast.

He looked up at me. "I lust for every inch of your body, and I'm going show you."

I arched my back so he could unclasp my bra, and he tossed it off the bed. He lowered his head, and traced circles around my left nipple, then my right, then back to the left one where he opened his mouth wide and sealed his lips around it, sucking it into his mouth.

Since becoming pregnant, my nipples were hypersensitive, and Max was clearly picking up on that fact, giving them more time and attention than he ever had. I squirmed beneath him as the sensation radiated from my breasts to all of my extremities.

I could have stayed there for hours as the tortuous pleasure engulfed me, but Max had other ideas.

Gently, he turned me onto my side, his tongue never leaving my skin, sliding along my side, then to my back as he positioned me onto my stomach.

I felt his soft, warm kisses on the middle of my back. Then higher, between my shoulder blades, and higher still, to the back of my neck as he swept my hair off to the side.

As he made a trail of soft kisses down my spine, he hooked his fingers inside the waistband of my panties.

Moving his mouth down lower to the small of my back, then to the curve of my ass, he slipped the underwear down my legs, following down the back of my right leg, kissing and licking along the way.

Then to my left ankle, and back up my left leg, slowing as he neared the top, then surprising me by biting me lightly on the cheek of my ass.

Max turned me onto my side, facing him. His head was still near my waist. He lifted my leg and brought it to his face, kissing the inside of my thigh, then moving farther up.

Rolling me over onto my back, he said, "I'll never get enough of you, Liv."

His tongue dragged up my thigh, just passing by my sex, and coming to a stop on my inner hip, where he kissed it and looked up at me.

A few quick, teasing licks of my clit. My hips rocked upward, reacting to his tongue. With one hand on each of my thighs, he spread my legs wider.

I thought he was about to make me come with his mouth, but he moved. He knelt between my legs and swiftly pulled his shirt off.

He then unbuckled his belt, lowered his zipper and let his pants fall to his knees, then pushed his underwear down.

I watched his fully erect cock spring free of the constraint of his boxer briefs, and his hand was immediately wrapped around his shaft.

He stroked himself, from base to tip, letting his thumb glide over the swell of the head, picking up the little bubble of moisture that had gathered there. He spread the silky precome around the head of his cock, and I could see it glistening from the lamplight.

Even after countless times being with Max, I still marveled at the sight of him naked - the way his muscles flexed and rippled under his taut skin.

"You're gorgeous, Liv, and it's been a while since I've fucked you like I should."

His voice was deep and like a breathy rumble, and the way he matter-of-factly announced what he was going to do to me almost made me beg for it.

But I didn't have to.

I felt the weight of his cock resting just above my sex as he leaned down to kiss me on the lips. His erection seemed to be radiating heat as it lay against my clit.

One slight shift, and the head of his cock penetrated me. Then another push, and he was inside.

"You're so wet," he said, tilting his hips left, then right, settling himself deep inside me.

He was going slow now. With each thrust in, he did that squeezing thing, making his thick erection swell even more.

I wanted this badly, and he was deliberately drawing it out to a tease. I tried to shift my weight and roll him over so I could ride him.

The corner of his mouth curled up into a half-grin as he grabbed my wrist, holding me firmly on my back.

"Trying to get on offense?"

"Yes. I need it," I said.

He shook his head, adding a frown for effect. "Sorry, but you're on defense from now on. No more offense for you."

Max was tonguing my nipples again and doing that light biting thing that always drove me wild.

"You don't think I can get on offense?" I said.

Without moving his head, he shifted his gaze to meet my eyes. "No."

"Really?"

"Yes," he said, and thrust his cock harder into me. "Really."

God, he was tempting me. Testing me.

I locked a leg around his and tried to flip over once more.

"No dice," he said, his hips now moving in a rolling motion - side to side and back and forth - as he fucked me harder.

SIXTEEN

Max's agent, Lyle, called one afternoon when I was shopping in Beverly Hills.

"How's little Max doing?" he asked.

"We're not going to find out the gender, but he or she is doing just fine. Thanks for asking. How are things with you? Signed that kid from the boy band yet?"

"Don't get me started," he said. "His music agent has him thinking he can do it all himself."

"Oh, big mistake. They're going to need your magic."

"No shit. The thing that pisses me off is that they'll give it a go and this music agent will fall flat on his face, and they'll probably end up signing with someone else just so they don't have to come crawling back to me."

"That sucks."

"And the thing is, I don't even care. I won't rub it in their faces. At least not directly. Anyway, are you in the office?"

"No," I said, flipping through some shirts on a rack. "I'm looking for clothes that fit a pregnant woman, but are comfortable and also don't scream 'I'm pregnant!' to the world."

Lyle didn't miss a beat. "Well, can't help you there. Sorry."

"I know. What's up?"

"How's 'Disputed' coming along?"

That's what we'd started calling the movie. "Disputed" instead of the full title, "A Disputed Life."

"On schedule and rolling right along," I said. "Budget's a little tight, though. Are you calling to pitch in?"

He laughed. "Nice try."

"I'm kidding anyway."

"Listen, I need to know if this thing's gonna be done in time for Sundance."

"Absolutely," I said, even though I had no idea if that was true.

"Great. So we're in."

"We are? What about the submission process?"

"Leave that to me," Lyle said.

"Oh, no."

"Oh, yes. I'm cashing in a favor. A big one. 'Disputed' is in Sundance. Done deal. How's that for agent magic?"

.........<br/>

"Okay," I said, choking back tears of happiness. "Yes."

.........<br/>

"Max, how long are we going to wait? I know I was the one who said we had to wait a while, but everything's good now. Every single doctor visit - "

"I know, I've been there for all of them."

I reached out and put my hand on his chest. "I know you have. I'm just saying that there's no reason to wait anymore. My parents aren't happy about us getting married, and I know for damn sure they're going to freak about the baby. And what are you going to do? Keep it from your mom? Forever?" I shook my head. "Max, we just have to let them know. Getting married is one thing, but the baby...that changes it all."

"Does it?"

I cocked my head to the side, not understanding why he didn't get it. "Yes, it does. It really does."

His eyes had been locked on mine as we spoke, but after my last comment he looked away. First to his right, then to his left, then finally settling on the ocean and the sunset just over my shoulder.

I didn't want to say anything. I'd already said enough. I wanted to hear what he said after processing it, something I knew he was doing intensely because he moved his hand up toward his face, putting his thumb on his chin and rubbed it. It wasn't what I'd call a nervous tic, but more like one of those involuntary things people do when they're in deep thought and don't even realize what they're doing.

Long seconds passed, but I kept my gaze trained on his face. Watching him think. Observing him working it out for himself.

He finally spoke: "I want to marry you tomorrow."

Max looked at me, waiting for me to respond, but I didn't have a coherent thought beyond the word: "What?"

He sat forward, getting closer to me. He put his hand on the side of my face and brushed my hair off my cheek, tucking it behind my ear.

There was something in his eyes - not lust, like I was used to seeing in moments like this, but a deeply longing look. It was something I'd heard people say, and knew what it meant, but never really knew what it looked like until that moment.

"I love you, Liv. Nothing, and nobody, is going to stand in the way of us. I don't care who they are. I know you want and deserve a huge wedding - "

I shook my head rapidly. "No, I don't want that. I never did."

"You can have whatever you want," he said. "I'll give it to you. I'll make your dream wedding come true. But think about hopping on a plane with me tomorrow, or tonight...yes, tonight...and it'll be just the two of us. No worries about anything or anyone else."

"This is crazy," I said.

"It is."

I shook my head slowly and saw the expression on his face change. He probably thought I was going to say no. But I reached my arms out and lunged for him, holding him tight.

"Okay," I said, choking back tears of happiness. "Yes."

.........<br/>

.........<br/>

.........<br/>

"You don't have to be ashamed, Paula. I'm just glad you came over and told me. You should talk to Max as soon as possible." I was thinking it would be great for the two of them to smooth things over, but also I was thinking about my pregnancy and the fact that all of this secrecy was getting ridiculous. "Call him, please?"

"Will you let him know I'm calling, and why? I doubt he'll answer his phone."

"He'll answer your call," I said. "He always would have and always will."

.........<br/>

I resented being put in this position, and certainly didn't need the pressure.

"Paula, just like I said last time, I can't keep anything you say from Max."

"I know, honey," she said. She'd never called me that, and I wondered if it was an honest outpouring of affection or if she was trying to get on my good side before she broke some even worse news than what she'd told me before.

"Maybe it's not a good idea at all," I said.

"I really need to talk. Are you home?"

"Yes."

"I'm in the driveway."

Shit!

So much for keeping the pregnancy from her. I ran through all my alternatives, and none of them were good.

I suppose I could have been firm and told her that it wasn't a good idea for her to be at the house until she talked to Max, but I would still need to do that face to face. Telling her over the phone or through the intercom speaker at the front door would have raised all kinds of new weirdness.

I could have called Max and asked him what he thought I should do, but he was busy, deep into the shooting of the movie, and there was no way I was going to add this to his to-do list.

"You're here?" I asked, for no other reason than to stall for time.

"Yes, can I please come in? Or could we talk on the front porch, at least? This is really important. I took a chance just stopping by. I wasn't even sure you were home but I see your car. Why are you home, anyway?"

This was my chance to get out of revealing the fact that I was pregnant, and somehow - pure luck, I suppose - the answer came to me.

"I sprained my ankle."

"Oh, no. Is it bad?"

"Yeah," I said, making my way to the front door, unlocking it and heading quickly to the kitchen. As quietly as I could, I put a bunch of ice cubes in a plastic bag, wrapped it in a towel, then made my way to the couch. I reclined, putting my leg up, with the towel-covered bag of ice draped over it. Then I bunched up a blanket, put it over my belly, then added a throw pillow for more bulk, and rested my hand on it. It must have looked ridiculous, but it was the only thing I could come up with on the spot.

"Do you need anything?" she asked.

I sighed. "Just come on in. The door's unlocked."

Then I remembered the wedding ring, and slipped it off, placing it under a pile of scripts on the coffee table.

"You leave your door unlocked when Max isn't here?"

"No, I just unlocked it for you and had to get back to the couch."

A couple of minutes later, she was standing in front of me, eyeing my wrapped ankle and insisting that I let her make me lunch.

"It's fine, really," I said. I hated being deceptive with her, but I really had no choice. I couldn't go behind Max's back and let his mother know that she was about to be a grandmother. That was up to Max, on his terms, on his own timing.

It was uncomfortable seeing her again, and I know she felt the same way toward me. I wanted this to be over with as quickly as possible, so I told her I was waiting on an important phone call and that I'd probably be tied up for the better part of an hour once the call came in.

"Okay," she said, "I understand. I know you two are very busy. Max is probably lost without you on the set."

"I'm sure he's fine."

She fidgeted for a moment, then said directly: "I told Max's father I couldn't speak with him anymore."

Now, that I was not expecting. I had been sure she was going to try to get me to talk to Max, soften him up, and help her get him to understand. But this was a much welcome turn of events.

I almost moved enough to dislodge the blanket and pillow covering my baby bump, but I managed to control myself. "Really," I said flatly, almost shocked.

She nodded. "I think what happened was..." She began to tear up, but I couldn't move toward her to comfort her. "Sorry," she said, regaining her composure. "I think I wanted normalcy in my life again, and for a long time that's what he was for me. But that longing for nostalgia wore off. It's actually been several weeks. It was just now that I decided to eat crow and come over here."

"You don't have to be ashamed, Paula. I'm just glad you came over and told me. You should talk to Max as soon as possible." I was thinking it would be great for the two of them to smooth things over, but also I was thinking about my pregnancy and the fact that all of this secrecy was getting ridiculous. "Call him, please?"

"Will you let him know I'm calling, and why? I doubt he'll answer his phone."

"He'll answer your call," I said. "He always would have and always will."

.........<br/>

"I didn't ask her anything about my father," he said. "I don't care and I don't want to know. And most of all, I don't want him to ever have anything to do with our children. I won't let that happen."

There was an anger in his eyes, but it quickly receded when I placed my hand on his head and combed my fingers through his hair, comforting him.

And he certainly didn't say anything to Paula about the pregnancy.

"I think we should tell her together," he said.

"That would be great. I would say give it as much time as you want, but we're kind of on a schedule here that I can't control."

Max smiled. "Good to know you have a normal human gestation period."

We lay together in silence for a few moments until I said, "Max, how are we going to handle all of this?"

That's when he told me his plan.

EIGHTEEN

Max and I had decided not to tell my parents over the phone. Instead, we waited until the last week before the due date, and I called and told my parents that I wanted them to come to LA, along with Grace, and that it was important.

My thinking was that it would be better to tell them face to face, and there was no way I was going to travel this close to my due date.

At first they demanded to know why I needed them to come out to LA so urgently, and I reassured them that it wasn't an emergency, that I was fine, and it was just something I would rather talk to them about in person.

Max offered to send the plane and have them flown out here, but something about that didn't sit right with me. I feared that my parents would see it as a power-play, especially since I wouldn't tell them why I wanted them to visit - only that it was good news.

Things had been more than rocky, to say the least, but parents are parents and when a child calls, the good ones run to them. Despite the recent fall-out, I knew my parents were good people and they would come to be by my side.

So they came by commercial flight, and Max and I met them at the airport.

I deliberately wore something that would show off my belly, just for the purpose of making the words easier to say, if I had to say them at all. Which I didn't, because the second Grace saw me, she happily screamed, "Oh, my God!"

My parents were undoubtedly floored when they saw me, but since Max was there, we ran very little risk of getting into a huge dust-up over my revelation.

Maybe it also had something to do with the fact that the doctors were going to induce labor in two days and there was very little time for them to coordinate an offensive against my life choice. What was done was done, and there was no going back now.

Mom, Dad and I had a sincere heart-to-heart talk that evening before they went to their hotel. They didn't want to stay at our house, and I hadn't expected them to anyway.

"I know you guys aren't happy about this," I said. "But it's going to happen, and I want you to be a part of my baby's life just like you're part of Grace's kids' lives."

"That'll mean you come home more often?" Dad asked.

"I'll work on that," I said.

Dad looked skeptical. So did Mom.

"I promise I'll try," I said.

The three of us group-hugged and I was grateful that I had at least some kind of sign that my family wouldn't be broken.

Surprisingly, it took a while to get to the topic of marriage, and it was my father who brought it up.

I had rehearsed my answer and explained to them that Max and I were indeed going to get married.

"When?" Mom asked.

"Soon."

"Here or home?" Dad said.

"Dad, this is my home."

I of course wore the engagement ring, but both of our wedding rings were in my jewelry box.

Step One of Max's master plan: complete.

.........<br/>

I thought the idea of a phony wedding ceremony was crazy, but Max told me to go with it, that it would make our friends and family happy. "Relax, Liv. We'll pull this off, Hollywood style," he had said at one point.

It was a modest wedding, one that my parents and Max's mother were very happy with. Max and I were simply placating our old-fashioned Midwestern parents.

Grace was my matron of honor, while Krystal, Monica and Loralei served as bridesmaids. Carl was Max's best man, and his other two groomsmen were Anthony and, strange as it may sound, my father. It was a touching moment for me, having him walk me down the aisle, hand me off to Max, and then take his place.

Even though families usually sit on different sides of the aisle, ours broke from tradition and sat together. This was mostly so our moms could each hold Gabriel during the ceremony.

Our vows were toned down from our real ceremony. Max and I decided that they were the most meaningful part of our actual wedding, and they were too important to include in the fake one.

The kiss, however, was as real as the one at our actual ceremony. When the kiss was over, Max whispered into my ear, "I'd marry you every day of my life if I could."

Later, at the reception in a small ballroom at a hotel not far from the park, Max pointed out something interesting: "You know, this is the only part of the whole thing that's genuine."

We were having our first dance as husband and wife.

"True," I said. "But the whole thing is genuine to everyone else here."

"Yeah, almost everyone."

He was referring to Carl, Anthony, Monica and Loralei, who were standing beside each other as everyone watched us dance.

Carl had a smirk on his face, and Anthony was shaking his head. Loralei and Monica were alternating between laughing between them and tearing up when they looked at us.

I knew them well enough by now to know that they weren't being critical - they were marveling at this stunt we'd just pulled off. A major production. All written and directed by Max.
