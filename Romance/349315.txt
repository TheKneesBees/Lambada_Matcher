GONE



November 10th 

Penelope—
am
Someone once said we’re born alone and we die alone. You died alone. Gone. It rests on my brain like a rock. I am alone, without you, and I want to be gone, too. Maybe my physical parts will fade until I disappear. I stare at your house. I don’t know how not to so I keep doing it. It’s my latest obsession. I look and look and nothing. All I see is dark, macabre. No lights. No life. There is the nothing you left behind. It is real, palpable. I could chew on it. No more life. Empty—I wear it like skin; the pumpkins carved and rotting right where we left them a few weeks ago on the front steps.  And your body, too, rotting, DNA smeared across the orange mush. I can’t stop remembering. It was like yesterday. I helped you carry out the big one, the heaviest. I can do it, you insisted. The stem broke. It fell on your foot. You laughed, hysterically: I’m going to pee my pants you screeched tears streaming down your face. Your hair tossed like soft silk. I wanted to touch it. I never told you that, how I wanted to touch it. Penelope, your house is so utterly dark, so utterly dark. I want to scream. Right across the street, just steps from my bedroom. I could get there in minutes if I wanted to. I always felt safe knowing that.  I could see you moving in your bedroom. No movement now. I imagine you breaking out of your shell, a stream of energy zooming off. What is it like? Tell me. Please return and tell me. I know you can hear me.

pm
Can’t sleep…I want to confess. A few times, I saw you getting dressed. I could tell by the way you moved your arms, up, over your head. I wanted to see you naked. I’m a monster. I imagined you and me, together. I did that a few times.  I imagined it all. But I could never admit it. Maybe I did it? Maybe I wanted to be with you so bad that I did it…I raped you and killed you. No, I can’t even think it. I would never hurt you. Penelope, I’m waiting for you. Remember we promised that if one of us dies, we’d let the other know what it’s like? I never imagined it could actually happen. You better come back and tell me! you had said. It was just two weeks ago:  we were eating chocolate chip cookies at the kitchen table.  You had chocolate crumbs in the corner of your mouth. You were alive, breathing. We talked about death and life in one moment, one split second:  I hate people that dip their cookies in milk. I hate that so much. I don’t get it at all! You elbowed me. My cookie bumped the side of the glass and it tipped over. The milk spilled on the kitchen table. Your Mom walked in. She smiled. She has your smile. “Okay, what’d you do this time, Seth Price?” You were laughing, laughing so hard, pulling paper towels and laughing and laughing and walking towards me and the whole roll trailed behind you. You loved to laugh.
Less than two weeks later, you’re murdered. I still can’t believe it. Where are you? Please, Penelope. I’m going to try to sleep. Please come see me tonight. I’m waiting. I know you will return to me, somehow. I know you can hear me. I need you.
Seth

2cents: man you’re in bad shape dude. Don’t let it get away from you, reality I mean. I’ve been there. Live in FL now but I knew Neal. He was a punk.
@2cents  I can’t imagine you’ve “been there” and how did you know Neal? 
2cents his mom and mine belonged to some book club. So his family came over Christmas Eve. He stole my mom’s ring out of her jewelry box. We know he did it. But we can’t prove it. We lived in Hartford. My family moved Florida last year.

THE VIRUS
November 11th
Penelope—
Hi. It’s me, and I’m sick and weak with some unidentified illness. I can barely move; my whole body aches, inside and out. I am bedridden and could stay this way indefinitely. I should go to your house, visit, and tell your parents how sorry I am for their loss. I can’t.  I can’t be there without you. Dorrie said I should. Ben chimed in with “why don’t you?’ I wanted to scream. Instead, I just said no; I said it real calm, too.  I think they are waiting for me to cry. I caught Dorrie crying. One time she was in Benny boy’s arms and he was rocking her back and forth saying “It’s okay” like she was a small child. It disgusted me. Mothers are not supposed to be rocked. Mothers are not babies. You would agree, Penelope. I never cry. When I told her I was writing a blog she said "That’s a great idea, Seth." she said it in this perky tone. It made me mad. I don’t understand how she can be perky now. Ben was grinning like he understands how I feel. Remember Ben, the reporter guy? You thought he was cute and said Whoa not bad for an old dude.  Well, since you died, he is here all the time. I think they are a real couple. I pretty much like him. He doesn’t cry. But he holds Dorrie. And he kisses her and I think he’s most likely been with her. And that grosses me out. And he's not really mine. He’s not mine at all. Dorrie has him. I have no one now that I think of it. Francis is gone. Now you’re gone. I have no one. I am utterly alone. School tomorrow and I’m already failing math and it’s a waste of time for me. I know enough. I know something sinister. Dorian’s damn equations pale in comparison. I know real life. I know darkness, real evil, more than a shadow or monster lurking in my closet that used to make me cower underneath my comforter. I know darkness like a best friend. I could eat it for breakfast, lunch dinner. I thrive on it now. It is somewhere inside me, latched on like a virus. I can’t let it eat me. Save me, Penelope. Please, save me.

anonymous  sad blog dude. Get some help. 
2cents  reality is slowly slipping, dude. I can’t stress enough that you need some booze, weed, meds, something to get you back on the right track.

THE SIGN
November 12th
Penelope—
I feel small.  I swear I’m shrinking. Remember that short story The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka? Well, I can relate. I can so relate now. I feel like Gregor, the pathetic salesman who transformed into an insect. I think my limbs are becoming immobile. Why is it that I can barely move? I want to be you with you. What happened to you? I’m waiting for a sign. You had gobs and gobs of positive energy. I don’t think it was squelched so easily. No way. So, I’m waiting for a sign, energy, a charge, something. Do you hear me? I think if I write you can hear me. I suspect Neal murdered you.  Only you know.  They adopted him. Did you know that? His biological parents were abusive, left him in the car for hours while they gambled and drank. It makes sense. Abusive kids grow up and abuse. But what if it's not and there are all those energies getting displaced. I’m trying to make sense. I’m left behind trying to make sense. It’s not your fault Penelope. I know. I miss you horribly. You are vivid, alive in my head. I have a running script of you Penelope, always.

THE NEWS
November 12th 
Penelope—
I can’t tell anyone that I’m blogging to you. It’s not normal. They might commit me. I’m on my laptop right now, blogging in the living room. Dorrie is sitting on the loveseat reading. Ben is working late. She asked what I was doing. I told her it was an essay for school. Then the whistle blew for her hot water. Just as she left the room, the news came on. I’m watching now. there are reporters and cameras in front of 9 Maple Hill Ave, interviewing Neal’s adopted parents; microphones, wind, wild, blustery, the works; the mother is Nancy; she looks like her name—Nancy neat and prim. You would agree, Penelope. She is leaning into her husband, Jack.  Wind blows Nancy’s hair across her face. She doesn’t care. It blows her hair across her face and into her mouth and into her eyes. She is wearing a dark wool blazer and a white blouse. I can’t tell if it’s silk or cotton. Nancy is listing to the side, crying; her voice is shaky: “Neal could not have done this. Not the Neal we know and love. Not our Neal.” I wonder why parents always say that, not our child as if they are immune to the tragedy that only befalls other people. “I can’t fathom it.” she adds.  Jack is at least two or three inches taller than his wife. He is wearing a long camel hair coat, his eyebrows are furrowed: “I can’t imagine the horror that the Rutherfords are experiencing right now. Nancy and I, we are both so sorry for their loss.”  He speaks in a low even tone, guarded, neutral. Landau called me that “guarded.” Nancy and Jack look at each other and then back to the reporters. Jack bows his head and then shakes it back and forth. Nancy’s hair is still loose around her face, strands blow on her mouth. It reminds me of a UNICEF advertisement, how a fly buzzes around a sad boy’s face, crawls on his lips, and he never swats it away. Maybe it’s for affect. “It’s a nightmare,” Jack says. Behind them, detectives are carrying computers and boxes out of the Lourdes’s home. They seem indifferent, talking to the back and forth to each other. “I keep waiting to wake up,” Nancy says. Jack reaches over and moves her hair to the side.  I don’t know what she’s thinking at this point. She is like a marionette puppet.  I can recall vivid memories and images but can’t tell what someone is thinking. I’m drowning in confusion. If confusion were water I’d drown. Dorrie sauntered back into the room embracing a mug of tea. Her expression was blank. I could have told her about the news. The old Seth would. I didn’t say anything. Why should I waste my time?  People are merely stick figures to me, or animated robots moving in and out of spaces. I see them down to their smallest parts, down to the molecules, the atoms, the energy and vibrations.
Seth
COMMENTS
2cents yep, I think it was him. Neal Lourdes is a criminal. I know it was him. I know it. I caught him in my parent’s bedroom. He claimed he was using the bathroom. He pawned that ring. It was worth a few grand.
@2cents Who are you? Where do you live? Do you live in town?
2cents Like I said (previous post) we moved Florida ten years ago. Neal was a punk then. I’m sure he hasn’t changed much. He used to hit me hard as hell for no reason and the say “just playin dude” I hate that. I hate when some punk like Neal messes with you and then says “just playin.” 

SCHOOL DAY
November 13th
Penelope—
I hate waking up. It hurts. I can barely eat. I despise school. I force myself to move, to get there. I arrive in body only. I just move from class to class, zoned out.  I’ve been thinking that Neal could have done it. Neal was a brute, a bully. He definitely bullied you. I know that. Undoubtedly, he was a complete ass.  But I never thought murder was in the cards. Maybe it was an accident. Maybe he had rage and it just blew out like a negative blast. I mean it does happen—not that I would know. I keep my anger in check. But I’ve read about it enough times.  You know the student who suddenly goes postal and fires rounds in the cafeteria. School, today, was a horror. It was utter horror. I had to pretend to be human, normal. No focus. I can't think straight.  I am assaulted, utterly assaulted by students begging to hear about it, to be near me, talk to me. There’s Jack Drowler with his noxious cologne, and even busty Tina Rainer suddenly wants to chat. She’s lurking like a stray cat. I tried to get rid of her by staring directly at her chest when she talked. She didn’t care. You know me Penelope better than anyone.  I don’t want those kids near me, touching me. It makes me want to scream.  I want you, Penelope. Do you hear me? Please give me a sign. I’m waiting. I thought I smelled you this morning. I really did. Can you breathe now? If so, I’d take a breeze or a sigh—anything.
Seth
COMMENTS
Susanne Seth, I can’t believe I found this blog! I was searching news articles. I talked to detectives yesterday. They took my computer after I told them about emails from Pen. But I printed off most of the emails first. I want to keep them. This one was written the day before the dance. It is so unbearable, I know. I can’t stop crying.
 Suz!
I can't tell you how mad I am at ykw. I can’t even say his name I’m so mad. He is the biggest loser that ever breathed. He said he would go to the dance and now is refusing. I thought maybe I’d give him one more chance to act normal. I'm so done with him. I mean it this time. I have no time for such nonsense!!! It's as if he's too cool to be seen with me at a Halloween dance? Or maybe he has other plans with the other ykw. I can't stand her. She will just use him. I know it. She is total emo trash!!! I guess they belong to each other!
PLEASE call me!! You need to come by tomorrow after school. I really want you to go to the dance with me. I do not want to go alone. I really need to stay away from him. He is so toxic. Maybe I'll talk to Seth! He may go with us! I think I can convince him. 
See ya
Pen
@susanne thanks. 


THE DESIRE

November 14th
Penelope—
It’s sickening, the thought of returning to school, the assault, the noise. I begged Dorrie to let me take a few extra days. Thank god she agreed. Chase keeps calling. What’s his deal? Regret, blame…call it what you want. All I know is that if I didn't go with him to the dance, I would have gone with you. Maybe you'd be alive now. I don’t want to blame him. And you wouldn’t like it. I can hear you Seth, come on. He’s a good kid. I know it's not his fault, but it's too complicated. I can't explain. I can't.  I can’t talk. Words are useless. And anyway Chase has always been a convenient friend not a real friend like you. I never told you that, but he wasn’t really my friend. Friends are overrated. You were my real friend. Now, I loathe the word friend. At this point, I hate most people. I just want you, Penelope. I don’t want anyone or anything else. You know the song you always liked by Bread “All I need is the air that I breathe and to love you.” Well I don’t even need the air. Just you would be enough. Just you, Pen.
Btw:  I found a jelly bean on the living room floor. It was a black jelly bean, your favorite, just sitting there right in the middle of the carpet. It’s you. I know it.

2cents drugs work but you have to find the right ones. I know what you mean tho about friends. Keep your so called friends close but your enemies closer. 


CONNECTED

November 15th
Penelope—
I really do hear you. It’s a sign. You’re communicating to me. I knew you would. That or I’m crazy. I hear your voice: Chin up!  I hear it in my head all the time. It’s weird. At first, it was soothing. But now, I’m hearing it too much and I wonder if I’m going insane. Maybe I’m losing my grip. Maybe it’s your voice, a good sign from you. Or, maybe it’s the other, that I’m losing my mind. Should I tell? Anyone reading my blog will know. But, I think Dorrie would hospitalize me. The docs would convince her. Yes, I know she would.  No way. Not happening. I figure I must be mourning. I’m entitled to mourn. It’s the most normal human emotion. So maybe I’m normal. I woke up to your voice; you said Seth and then I smelled burned toast. Ben burned toast; the smoke wafted all the way upstairs. I heard them laughing like idiots. I walked downstairs and saw them at each other. They don’t care how my life is meaningless, they don’t care.  They need to grow up. No, they just kept laughing, groping. Now I know they are naked together. I even asked Ben “so, are you spending the night now?” His mouth hung open. He was speechless. Dorrie gave me the evil eye. You know, Penelope. If you could see them you'd give me that look. I liked how squinted your eyes and scrunched your nose. Penelope you were my best friend. But I wonder if you loved me? I think I loved you. Maybe I did. Maybe I should have told you. Why didn't I? What's wrong with me?  I think you hear me now. If you do, I’ll admit that I loved you, Penelope Rutherford. I know. It is too late. But, maybe not so I’ll say it. God I wish you were here NOW! WHERE ARE YOU?  I LOVE YOU PENELOPE RUTHERFORD!!!!

Susanne: Seth, If you need to talk contact me I pm'd my phone and email.
It’s so incredibly hard without her. I think she is still here!!! She was my best friend too. She really loved you, Seth. She talked about you all the time. This blog is so sad. I don’t know if I can keep reading. I’ll try. Please call me. I have more emails, I’ll post soon.
Heather OMG this blog is so depressing. What is it? Is it like a memorial for Penelope? Do you think she can hear you? I’ve never read a blog like this before. I knew Penelope too!! She was in two of my classes this year. I just moved here from Vermont so I didn’t know her that well. She was hilarious. She used to look back at me and cross her eyes when Mr. D. was lecturing.  I loved how she crossed her eyes! Seth, I really like how you’re writing this blog. I think it’s so cool. I can’t wait to read more. I feel so sad for you though. : (   I do think you could use some help.
@heather thanks but I’m fine. I don’t need your help. If you think you’re going to cheer me up, you’re not. Life isn’t that simple. It’s not all about root beer lip gloss and the ski team. I think you are grossly misinformed about me. I despise most people and am writing this for myself and Penelope and no one else. I don’t want any diatribe about how pitiful I am and how sad it must be. All that wasted jargon; all those niceties make me want to vomit. 
Heather fyi I don’t wear lip gloss and am petrified of skiing and I forgive you honey.
@heather  don’t call me honey.


THE RETURN
November 16th
Penelope—
I saw you. I swear it was real. You were right next to me. I smelled your hair— lilac and lemon.  You were sitting on the foot of my bed. You looked right at me. You smiled. You moved in closer. I reached out. I touched your hair, ran my fingers through it. I put my head up close to it and smelled it. I almost kissed you; our mouths were so damn close but then a sharp wretched sound, penetrating my ears:  “TIME TO GET UP, SETH!” It’s unbearable pain, the real world I mean, without you, Penelope. I don’t know if I want to stay here with you. Why? Who did those things to you? Who? I’m supposed to go back to school. I can’t imagine. You loved school, told me to study hard: Study hard, Seth! I hear you. I feel it; your energy is here with me. Okay. I’ll go for you. Just for you, Penelope. If I keep writing to you then you may hear me and return. You did last night. But then waking is torture. I can’t wait to come home, to sleep. I’ll try to study hard. I’ll try for you Penelope. I don’t want to lose this part of you that’s still living in my head. I keep thinking about your eyes. They looked almost sad. I can’t bear it anymore. Were you sad for yourself or me? 
Seth

2cents  you’re in denial dude. Get some help, some meds, something. When I lost my dog, I was the same damn way. Get a grip.
Heather I’ll look for you today, Seth. What do you look like? Who are your teachers? PM me a pic of yourself so I can find you! You won’t scare me away. I know you’re sad, but I can cheer you up!
@heather  no thanks.
@2cents I don’t need your asinine advice. Losing a dog and a human are two entirely separate items. You’re a buffoon.
2cents I loved that dog like a brother. Yeah you need to get a grip bro

DISSASSOCIATED AMENISA
November 17th
Penelope—
Ok, I did it. It was painful, like jumping into a tub of ice; but I went to school, faked it. The kids are distant. Focus is impossible. I’m trying to listen to dull teachers like you told me. But they are monotone and their voices drone on like an annoying hum. One part of me knows I need to care but the other part is lost. It’s as if my brain is split in two. One side is for you and the other half is on pause. Who killed you? Who? Who could do that to you? Was it Neal Lourdes or someone else?  Maybe it was me. Maybe I blacked out. Could I do something like that? Could I have some freaky psychotic break? I think it’s called Disassociated Amnesia. I remember it on CSI. This guy seemed normal enough and then murdered his family, kids too. His last memory was of scrambling eggs. He didn’t remember a thing. No trigger. No signs. No. I couldn’t do that. The detective came to our house, didn’t make me feel any better. Joe, detective Joe, came to our door, said he wants to speak to me. Dorrie made an arrangement because I have missed so much school. So, I have to go tomorrow. I know it’s not me. I know that Penelope. But what if I seem suspicious, too nervous? I could be a prime suspect. What should I say? How much should I tell?  It's torture not knowing. Neal never said he would kill you. I don't know. Wouldn't he have said it at some point? Maybe he did to you. I never heard him. Maybe he was careful not to let anyone else hear. Sociopaths can have high intelligence. I read that somewhere and I thought I was one. Maybe I am. How would I know?
Seth
COMMENTS
Susanne I found email which proves Neal was abusive. I’m sure detectives will consider it as solid evidence. I can’t believe he’s not arrested yet.
Suz,
Neal actually pushed me so hard I fell backwards and hit my head on the fence!  I hate him. The owner of the miniature golf range insisted on calling the police. They talked to us both. I said I didn’t want to press charges that it was not intentional and we were joking around. Still, they took all our info and made me go in the ambulance to the hospital!!! Now my parents are involved. It's a nightmare!! It's just a small cut!! But it bled everywhere. And I did get dizzy. 4 staples!! My parents told me I have to stay home for a couple days and they don't want me anywhere near Neal. I guess it is for the best. He really is a loon. I don’t know why I’ve stayed with him anyway. He never leaves me alone!  I'm trapped.  Going to Seth's.  At least I’m allowed over there and my cutie Francis is deploying in a few weeks or so!!! He is so hot. Call me or come over!!! I miss you!!
See ya 
Pen
@susanne I remember the staples. She showed me but she never told me the truth. She said she fell. I could kill that jerk.

TOXIC EM FIELDS AND THE IMPOSTERS

November 17th
Penelope—
I walked the neighborhood. I don’t know why. I looked out the window at your house and I got an urge to walk, be there, and smell the night air. The wind wrapped around me like coat. I ended up avoiding your house. I went outside in bare feet, short sleeves and shorts. The night air felt cool and nice so I imagined it was your arms. I’m stuck in a bizarre dream zone lately and it scares the crap out of me. I stayed away from your house. I can’t go near it. It’s too lonely, and there’s too much melancholy, too much damn melancholy, I thought of that word, it just popped in my head and it’s one of your words, and I knew it was you, feeding me, guiding me, egging me on from house to house. It’s unlike me, to knock on doors and talk to people, neighbors I don’t really know or care to know. So, it must have been you working inside me, imbibing positive currents, adrenaline. Unfortunately, I disappointed you again, Penelope. The only thing I found was emotional intensity possibly from an overload of electromagnetic fields. There are five or six transformers in our neighborhood. Remember we counted them? It doesn’t make sense. It doesn’t make any damn sense at all. We are being poisoned!  I should call the electric company. It’s disgusting. People are being poisoned. I just can’t think about it right now. The old Seth would have been on the phone. The old one is gone now. Anyway, I wasn’t spared the idiocies of an old lady blubbering over her lost cat, a kid screaming, a kid spitting, three dogs growling, a rude man and not one person saw you that night. Not one!  What's wrong with these people! I’m suspicious, paranoid. Call it what you want, but maybe they are all imposters conspiring to keep the truth from me. I saw you.  I saw you walking with Susanne and I should have yelled to you said hi, gone outside, but I was feeling strange, mad, jealous I don't know. I hate feelings. I don’t know what I’m feeling most of the time. If I did, I would have talked to you, explained. You were with Neal after school and when I waved you didn't wave back. I decided I hated you. I decided I'd never forgive you for not waving back. Now you're dead. And maybe I was so enraged, I did it. I can’t think that. Your flesh is ash. You were incinerated. But your energy is here. I forgive you Penelope. I do. But it's too damn late. Maybe these words are reaching you in that place where you are now, somehow. Maybe the energy particles are flowing upward. I feel it. I have to believe it or I might as well die too. This blog is my only hope of reaching you.
COMMENTS
Susanne Seth do NOT blame yourself. Your blog makes me cry. It’s not hard to do these days. But I can’t stop reading it. Penelope forgives you. I know she does. She really loved you, Seth. But she is gone. We need to move on. Please call me. I see you need help.
@susanne I got your number. But, sorry to say, I won’t call. I hate the phone. I don’t like wasting words— unless they are for Penelope. No, I don’t need help from you or anyone. And as for moving on, speak for yourself. I can’t abandon Penelope right now. We are connected.

THE SUSPECT
November 18th

Penelope—
I saw him. I saw Neal Lourdes walk by your house last night. It was dark, but I know it was him. I could tell by his dumb, lumbering gait. He had a cigarette in his hand. I saw the tip glowing, watched him bring it to his mouth. I hid behind the curtain in my bedroom. He just stood there smoking, like some buffoon, staring at the house. And then he walked past my house, up towards the cul-de-sac. He got into his truck. It was parked right in front of Trudy Markus’s house. I think it was her, standing next to the truck. But it was too dark to tell.  10 minutes passed and then he drove away.  I’m surprised there isn’t a restraining order. Maybe he doesn’t care.  If he murdered you, Penelope, maybe he feels guilty. Or maybe he misses you? Or maybe he never killed you and it was someone else? I mean Neal said he’d kill me. But I don’t think he really meant it. People say things they don’t really mean. He loved saying I’ll kill you wimp boy, remember Penelope? But he never did it. And I was never afraid, never thought he would do it. Wouldn’t I have been more leery if he really was a psychopath? Penelope I’m confused, so I did what you always did. I made a list. Here are reasons Neal could be wrongly accused:
1.Murder cases are often not open and shut cases
2.According to a study an estimated 10,000 are wrongfully convicted in the US (that’s a conservative estimate)
3.All evidence pointing to Neal Lourdes could be a misdirection of the waves
4.Trial is getting delayed repeatedly 
I’m going to Trudy’s. I feel renewed hope, Penelope. Is this coming from you? Maybe you are instilling me with your positive energy waves. I feel a charge. I feel it. I have to hope. You are my oxygen, Penelope, my motivation to move, to breathe.

Heather I’m happy to see you are feeling hopeful! : )  
Susanne Yes, I agree it’s odd how Neal is hanging out with Trudy Markus. I wonder if she knows mething

TRUDY MARKUS

November 19th
Penelope—
I did it. I went to Trudy’s. You were with me, Penelope. I was so brazen. That’s your word, brazen. You always had good ones. You’re feeding me words, confidence. I feel you. Here’s what happened: First, I heard the Sex Pistols blaring. Second, Emilio Markus the grandfather answered the door. He smelled like booze (no surprise), looked disheveled, unshaven, a dour expression.  I asked if Trudy was home and she appeared, suddenly, from around the corner: “What do you want with her?” she asked me. Penelope she was wild. But then again I always liked her. I’m realizing this now, as I write: she was like a wild trout (don’t ask me why I said that). I felt an urge to catch her. She was wearing black lace gloves, a red velvet scarf and her hair was dark with one purple streak. Her lips matched the scarf.  She moved in closer, and I noticed her fishnet stockings and black combat boots. Grandpa Emilio grumbled and walked away.  “So, I’ll ask again, what do you want from me, lad?”   She really said that, lad, and it made me pause and I liked her even more. Let’s just say, I was intrigued. She didn’t’ say dude, she said lad. I got right to the point and asked her if she was home the night you were murdered. I took a deep breath, kept my voice calm. You would have been impressed. “Who wants to know?” she asked.    
  	“Me,” I said. I was so unbelievably composed, Penelope. I surprised myself. She told me she had already been through the “inquisition” that’s what she called it, and she was irritated. I could tell. I was focused, kept at her, asked if she recalled seeing you on your bike between 5:30 and 6:00, if she was home. She kept saying no, no, no, but I had a hunch she was holding back. I don’t know why. It was you, Pen. I bet it was you. I swear you were feeding me positive waves, confidence. I drove the ball home: “Do you believe Neal Lourdes killed her?” She didn’t bat an eye. She called me stupid. “Neal could get 40 years in prison unless he has an alibi” and then I added “10,000 criminal are wrongly accused in the US. I mean, it would be on your conscience.” 
 	“That's crap! That’s crap! You are such an idiot! Neal Lourdes could not have done it!”
She was vicious, pit bull-vicious, shouting, foaming at the mouth. I told her he was abusive, and he used to hit you and that I saw him. I told her how Neal had a motive because he was obsessed with you, Penelope, and how you wanted to leave but he wouldn’t let you. She called me crazy, freak, all kinds of names. Then (this is the part that made me flip) she said she was with him the entire night so that he couldn’t have done it. Penelope, I tried to stay calm but my damn body failed me, and I started shaking. I couldn’t breathe. Penelope, why? It was as if you burst out of me and left me hollow, breathless, shaking. “What?”  I managed. My voice quivered. I felt my lip twitch. “You know you are Neal’s alibi? Do you know that? Do you know you’re his ticket to freedom?  Did you tell anyone, yet?”  She said no and that she was not going to the police. I mentioned perjury, how she could be charged with it if she withheld important information. She looked at me strangely first, like she was confused, and then she smirked.
“Neal told me it’s all good,” she said.	
My heart was pounding out of my chest. I paced, Penelope, I started pacing like a freak. I was mad at myself, for my weakness, at her, at Neal, at you, even, for leaving me there empty and shaking. “What do you mean all good?  How? How is it all good?”  I asked.  (It gets more bizarre). She confessed that she was a lesbian and was in a relationship and she didn’t want her girlfriend to find out about Neal. Penelope, I was dumfounded, fuming. I didn’t care what Trudy thought now. I kept pacing, shook my hands. I must have looked psychotic. “Listen, I don’t care about your lesbianism, but you could be Neal’s only chance!”  I was a maniac. I couldn’t help myself. I thought maybe it would make a difference. It didn’t.
“You weird jerk,” she threatened, “do not even think about going to the police or my cousin Manny will kick your little freaky butt. I mean it.” She put her finger right in my face. I wanted to bite it. I swear I wanted to bite it off.  I could actually feel my teeth sinking into her flesh. It would be so easy, I considered. 
“Get off my damn porch before I call the cops, freak!” she yelled and slammed the door.
Here’s the thing.  It was all me, Penelope. It was my rage. It was raw. I owned it and it felt good.
pm
I can’t eat. Dorrie keeps staring at me oddly. She must be worried.  I don’t have time for her. I keep thinking about Trudy Markus. And I have these questions, big ones, pricking my brain like needles. How could Neal NOT use Trudy as an alibi? What’s going on? If Neal is wrongly accused then your real murderer will rape and kill again. Penelope, who killed you? Why would Trudy be with your boyfriend? Susanne’s email mentioned that you did know about Trudy and Neal. You never told me. Did you know Trudy was a lesbian too? I guess that would make her bisexual. I’m utterly confused. I know you are with me, Penelope. I hope you hear these words.  I feel as if I’m becoming tangled and pulled down into a murky pond by roots and grass where Manny is waiting to pull me down deeper.  Rage was my power. Rage was gone.  I was weak, deflated, like a popped balloon. I could barely walk home. Please help me, Penelope. What now?

2cents interesting twist. If she actually is his alibi, I mean
Susanne omg. She must be lying. What do you think? She has to go to the police. And now you know. So, you have to tell! She confessed to you. This may be important or nothing. But don’t sit on it, Seth.
@susanne I’m taking a break. I need to think.

LOST
November 20th
Penelope—
I hate loss. I’m drowning in a pool of it. I need a boost, a positive charge. Every day I look out at your house. Every day I see the rotting pumpkins and melancholy, lots of melancholy. Then, inside my house, Dorrie and Ben are pawing and gushing over each other. I can tell they are trying hard not to for my sake. That’s almost as bad. So I took Dr. Landau’s advice (for the first time) and tried to switch channels, tune off Trudy’s odd love triangle and perjury and Manny and I logged onto Facebook. First I tried to access your account and realized it had been shut down. So I logged onto my own for the first time in weeks. I deleted all the sentiments from fake friends who are more nosy than loyal and went right to my album labeled White Sands. I found the pic that you posted, the one of us standing in front of the beach store. I was wearing my favorite shirt. Remember my blue shirt that said White Sands Beach across the front in darker blue letters? You were with me the day I bought it. I was nine. I never wanted to wear anything else. You always said not that dang shirt again! You said dang because you hated swearing. I remember the day as if it were yesterday. You were visiting for the weekend. You were eleven at the time, and I was jealous because you and Francis kept laughing and hitting each other. “What’s so funny? What’s so funny?” I kept asking. Francis bought punks, sparklers, black snakes and glow sticks. You bought a mood ring. I had $10.00—birthday money. I had a crush on you. I didn’t really know it at the time. The shirt was on sale for $9.99. I needed tax. You paid the rest. It’s too big, you said. Francis agreed. I saw your nose scrunch up like it does. You swished past me. Your back was sunburned over tan. You smelled like Coppertone. The shirt was too big for me.  I wore it anyway. In fact, I wore it all the time. I wouldn’t go to school if it wasn’t clean. Then one day I lost it. Each day I was convinced I’d find it. You asked where’s your blue beach shirt.  I’ll find it, I told you. But I never did. My favorite shirt was gone. That's how I feel about you, Penelope—you are like my lost blue shirt I can't wear anymore. I know it sounds strange, but I thought of last night and I needed to tell you that. Where did that blue shirt go?  Where did you go, Penelope Rutherford? If you can tell me, please, please do it. Do it now.  I’m waiting. I know the shirt can’t give me a sign. A shirt has no spirit. When it is gone, it’s gone. But I know you hear me. I have to believe it.
Seth

Susanne I remember that shirt too. You were such a cutie. You had the biggest curls all over your head. You wore that shirt all the time. Where do you think it went? Can you buy another one? Maybe you might want to do that. Post the pic too (love to see it)
@susanne it wouldn’t be the same. I posted a link to the pic. Don’t call me cutie.
Anonymous I had a favorite green Celtics shirt. I wore all the time too. Then one day, at recess, during a soccer game some jerk grabbed me from behind and yanked. The shirt ripped. I know what you mean. I missed that shirt bad. I have a new one now though. Buy another one. Get over it.
@anonymous what do you mean by “get over it?” You don’t get it. And I loathe that expression. I think you need to say what you mean which I think is to buy a new blue shirt and it will make me forget all about Penelope Rutherford. Not happening.

SHRINKING

November 21st
Penelope—
I meet with Joe the detective today. I don’t want to. I don’t care about him, or anyone. I’m utterly alone. I’m Gregor the salesman transforming into an insect. I can feel myself changing in ways I can’t control. My voice is stifled. My limbs are mostly frozen. In order to move them, it takes concerted effort. I am utterly drained.  I wonder if sadness can dissolve your spine. Even with the good news about Trudy being a possible alibi, it just makes me feel more alone, more confused.  Should I tell the police? Joe will grill me. What will he ask? Now I know it might not be Neal. That is unless Trudy is lying. My confusion will look like guilt. Joe will misconstrue it and think I did it. Motive is easy. Best friend, social outcast, rejected. You did reject me, Penelope. I mean, Neal was your real boyfriend. And you never did ask me to the dance. And many times you said you’d be over and then you wouldn’t show up or call. But I know that you trusted me more than Neal. I was a real friend.  You would tell me to go to the police. You would tell me to do the right thing. And I should do the right thing. But maybe Trudy will go to the police before I go talk to the detective today at 3:00. Then I won’t have to get involved. I don’t want to think about it I wish I never talked to her. Manny may kill me. Maybe I don’t care. Maybe I deserve to die. If I murdered you, I deserve it. If I can be with you, I don’t care. What if Trudy already called him? Penelope, you know I’m a coward. If Manny tries to kick my freaky butt, he’ll do it. I only want to find your murderer. I’m willing to die for the cause. If Neal is convicted, he could spend his life in prison. 
And then if all this stress wasn’t enough, there’s Emmet Price and Thanksgiving looming. He always haunts me on the holidays. I wonder what he’s doing. I wonder if he misses me. I don’t know why these times I crave him. I don’t know my father. I never did. I know he’s an artist. That’s all. Artists are strange and suicidal. Maybe that’s why I’m that way too. I guess you would say I was depressed, Penelope. But, really I’m not. You were always smiling and happy. You made me happy. Nothing makes me happy now. Dorrie tries but it doesn’t work anymore. She stares at me too much. She is not uplifting. Her voice grates on my nerves. She is happy, in love with Benny boy, the opposite of me. I am empty, small, shrinking, a spineless freak, a bug.

THE INQUISITION

November 21st
Penelope—
I met with Joe. He shook my hand, told me to call him Joe. He was short and spunky with heavy brows and a Danny DeVito mannerism. But he didn’t smile and smacked his lips too much.  He smelled like garlic. He asked questions. I answered, weirdly. Now, I think he suspects. He paused too much, gave sideway glances. Dorrie asked to come in the room with me. I said no because I felt stupid. Then when he asked about our relationship I felt strange, wanted to plead the 5th, ask for a lawyer. “You mean with Penelope Rutherford?” I asked, stupidly.  I said you and I were friends and then I added “best friends.” I said too much, overstated. I know because then Joe asked if I had ever had a sexual relationship with you. I was mortified. “Sexual? No. I said no.” But I almost screamed it, and I squirmed. Not good. Joe didn’t seem the least bit affected. He kept at it, asked me if I was attracted to you. I wanted to confess. I wanted to say, yes, because I really was attracted to you. Not in the beginning, no, but later. But I never said anything. I just sat there on pause. I know he was waiting. So, I was honest. I figured if I was partly honest, the words would come out better. I told him “Yes, we were best friends” and that “yeah she was pretty so of course, so maybe, maybe now that I think of it I was partly attracted. Who wouldn’t be?” My voice cracked and the words trailed off in an odd way. And then Joe smacked his lips, I hate the way he did that, and asked me to give him an example. I explained how you would sit next to me and touch my hand or my leg and I would feel “sort of excited” that’s how I said it. AH!  I cringe when I think of it. Sort of excited? What’s wrong with me? That’s all I told him. He stared at me, waiting for more, one arm outstretched, tapping his fingers. Then he agreed, said you were a pretty girl for sure. No doubt about that. It was disgusting when he said this, the way his fingers circled the rim of his coffee cup and his eyebrows lifted. Next, he asked about the last time I saw you. I told him how I was getting ready for the dance in my bedroom, and I heard you and your friend, Susanne, outside, laughing. Susanne was smoking. And then an hour later, I looked across the street and noticed that Susanne’s car was gone and you were on your bike riding away. I watched you until you were a spec. I didn’t say that. And I didn’t tell him how I was mad at you because when I walked by you after school you were standing next to Neal’s truck and you ignored me. And how the day before you told me you wanted to get rid of Neal but he just kept texting you. And then you were with him, clearly enjoying yourself, standing so close to him, touching him. And I assumed that you were probably going to the dance with him and so I decided I wouldn’t tell you I was going to the dance. I didn’t tell Joe about my plan to go to the dance and ignore you, how I imagined you’d see me dancing, having fun, flirting, and realize, finally, that I was the one you wanted. I didn’t tell Joe any of that. And I didn’t say anything about Trudy Markus.  
Joe couldn’t read minds…good thing. He smiled for the first time, a wide Cheshire cat grin, handed me his card and asked that I call him right away with any new information. That was that. I walked outside and Dorrie was sitting slumped in the chair, waiting. She looked pathetic. I can’t say why.  I don’t want her sympathy. I know that much. She thinks she understands, but she doesn’t. I wanted to be alone. I asked her if I could have some bus fare. She glanced back and forth between Joe and me. Finally, she blew out some air and dug into her pocketbook. It was the first time I’d ever taken a city bus to my house from the center, and so it took me two hours to get home. First, I got on the wrong bus. And then I missed the right bus. I didn’t mind. I just sat and thought about you Penelope. I remembered the last time I was on a city bus. It was a week of hot, 100 degree heat. I was eleven or so. You were thirteen. You wanted candy. It was too hot to ride our bikes to the store. Let’s go to the mall, you said. It was our project for the day. We scraped up enough change and took the bus. It was a heat wave. It was an adventure. I thought about the ride home, you sitting across from me, clutching your bag of candy, how your leg kept swinging back and forth, brown sandals, grimy toes, the way your hair stuck to the side of your face, your flushed cheeks sticky from candy.
I saw the world in the windows behind you, watched it speed past your head and it was perfect. And now I’m small, shrinking, please hear me, help me find him.

Help!!! Told Neal it was over. He flipped. Said he was going to kill himself and made me get out of the truck at a traffic light in the center!! Then he sped off like a maniac. I walked home; I have no idea where he is. For all I know he's dead. Call me immediately!!!

Susanne he wasn’t dead btw. He did this all the time. 
@susanne please stop posting this crap. For all I know, you wrote these emails to get attention.

CHANNELED ENERGY

November 22nd
Penelope—
 I’m addicted. Blogging brings me closer to you, Penelope. I guess you could say then it’s my purpose, and I was meant to do this. Some people are born to build houses or bridges. I was born to build sentences for you.  Bur really, I have this crazy energy and if I don’t do something my waves will build up, explode outward in one tremendous negative blast. And isn’t that what we are here for, to create? All energy is waves that are internalized and channeled. I’m convinced that if we fail to use the energies properly, we become stagnant or displaced, and these currents build up and create a dysfunctional static in the environment—hence, my desire to channel my waves and write, and write to you, Penelope. Maybe that’s the beauty.  You would agree. I know you would.  I know you hear me too.
Seth

Heather I love love love that pic of you. What a sweet heart. Thanks for sharing. I think I saw you walking home the other day. Do you walk? I can give you a ride if you want. Let me know. You have an amazing way with words. Penelope did too. I remember when she shared her journal entry “How I Spent My Summer” and it was incredible.
@heather I remember reading some of it. I was the first one. She shared everything with me. She never, ever mentioned you. Are you a troll?
Heather NO! LOL 

THE SAD HOUSE
November 22nd
Penelope—
Your house is depressed. I never told you this, but I used to like looking at your house, knowing you were in there. It was the last thing I saw before I went to bed and the first thing I’d see before I got dressed.  I remember it vividly, how it was always brightly lit. I could peek into the downstairs bay window and see bodies moving; the television flashing; the tall dark stained book shelves; the GIANT Toulouse-Lautrec; the gold framed mirror.  No more, Penelope. No more. The blinds are drawn. The garage, where you keep your bike, is always closed. I want to go in there, see your bike, touch it, hop on and ride it. The house is dark ALL the time. You would hate it. I remember peering up into your bedroom and I could look inside and see you moving, sitting at your computer. Sometimes, it was just your shadow, the hint of you that made me feel safe. You used to yell out the window at me. One time, I threw pebbles at your window and you yelled down what is this some damn movie.  I couldn’t believe you swore. It was the one time you did. Now, the blinds are drawn. I keep looking, waiting, walk by just to see if there’s any change. It’s eerie—a house stuck in Halloween: three pumpkins are on the front stairs; a scarecrow and corn stalks are propped up against the lamp post; a witch on a broom is nailed to the oak tree; tiny ghosts dangle from the branches of the cherry tree.  It’s just the way you left it. I think it’s mourning, Penelope. It misses you. I don’t know why I’m telling you this. It is so sad I can barely breathe. A sad house—the ordinary things make it more torturous. It’s like an Edgar Allen Poe prop. You would agree. It really is depressing. Maybe you could return somehow and make it better, turn some lights on? Maybe I am losing my mind. I posted a pic so you can see what I mean. I can’t go near it…too much sadness and negative charges.

CORAL CASTLE
November 23th’
Penelope—
No word from Joe. Maybe he didn’t suspect me after all. Maybe I blame myself. Maybe I’m paranoid. I can’t get a thought straight in my head. Very few people understand me. You called me eccentric. That’s a nice way to refer to a loner, reject, maniac.You understood me, liked when I talked about electromagnetic fields and buying a gauss meter. Try not to talk so much, you would tell me. What if your voice disappears? I couldn’t bear it.  I tried hard for you, Penelope. You would give me that look or hit my arm and I knew to shut up. You helped me so much. I keep thinking, now what? I rarely talk. So today I surprised myself in history class. I talked about Edward Leedskalnin, remember him? My guy, the one from Latvia who tapped into an energy field and carved a coral castle and discovered the mystery of Stonehedge and the Egyptian pyramids and the secrets of the universe, remember?  I thought of him. It was today, during class, Daglio went on about some war and how soldiers had increased stamina to survive the elements. And out of nowhere, I felt a surge inside me (maybe it was you) and I didn’t even raise my hand. I blurted out how Ed Leedskalnin had more than stamina than any soldier, how he moved 120 tons of rock all by himself, how he worked at night so no one could watch. “I think he was private or paranoid or maybe a bit of both,” I said.  Everyone stared at me. I could feel their eyes boring holes into me. I just kept going:  “Ed was engaged to be married to his 16-year old girlfriend in Latvia. But she changed her mind, so he never got over it and he built the castle to honor her. People say he immortalized his love in coral.” (Complete and utter quiet) “Ed said we studied positive electricity but not enough of the negative.  He theorized that positive streams come from the North Pole individual magnets and negative streams from the South Pole individual magnets.” The quiet was so powerful, so profound, so blatantly pandemic you could have heard a staple hit the floor. No one cares. No one cares about Ed the way you did, Penelope.  Not Mr. Daglio, not the students, not anyone. I proved it. You were the only one that cared about Ed. I think he’s prophetic. You said that. We were on the floor, counting change for a movie. We were always scraping change. I was convinced I had $20.00. I was wrong. It was only $14.53. I decided you and I were on the same channel. I never said it though. Now I’m alone. I wish I had said it. I wish I had said lots of things. So I’m saying them now. I’m blogging to you, Penelope. 
BTW, after my blog, I was skimming some older e-mails and found the one you wrote about Ed, the time you went to Miami and visited his castle. It must be a sign. How could it be that I would find this one email after talking about Ed? We are still on the same channel. I’m convinced!  I’m euphoric!!!!
Hi, Seth!
I miss you and wish you were here! OMG.  You’ve got to come with us next time. It was so cool being right in the spot where Edward Leedskalnin manipulated gravity. I swear I could feel his energy. The rocks were so incredible! I can’t imagine him lifting these by himself! I can’t even describe it. I had prickles all over my skin. I felt this electrical charge right away when I walked into the castle. No one believed me. You would understand, Seth. Only you would get it. My parents looked at me all worried like I was losing it. I wish you were here with me. The guide was obnoxious. He kept snorting and it was ruining the moment. And when he talked it took him like 10 minutes to finish a sentence. He seemed so distraught. Maybe the energy waves were too much for him. LOL. I took lots of pics for you.  We come home in a few days.  Tell Francis I said HI! See you soon. : ) love, P

FIRST SNOW
 
November 24th
Penelope—
The first snow of the season…English, room 118—me, invisible, eyes fixed on the window; Moran’s voice droning about parts of an essay; trivial compared to you.  You are my essay.  It was last December: Francis is in Afghanistan. We build a snowman, tall, six feet high. I can’t believe how tall she is you said. We use a carrot for a nose and two Queen Olives for the eyes: “Queenie!” We are giddy, crazy, circling Queenie like a Goddess.  I tie my scarf around Queenie’s neck. Francis calls from Afghanistan. You dance over to Dorrie, take the phone from her. Your eyes are bright. I remember that; how your eyes were always bright, full of sunlight:  Hello? How are you? What’s it like there?  Then, it’s my turn. I talk to him and tell him about the snow, ask about the weather in Afghanistan. Dorrie takes the phone back, and I’m still thinking about him, how his voice sounded delayed when he talked, how I should have said I love you or I miss you. I worry it could be the last time I ever hear his voice. After, we eat jelly beans with turkey sandwiches; we sit on the cherry wood chairs in the dining room where the bay window overlooks Queenie. You break the silence: I hope she’s not melted by tomorrow.
 “I miss Francis,” I admit. “I hope he doesn’t get hurt.”
I know…weird that he is so far away in an actual war, you say. I stare at you. I would do that, stare at you and you didn’t stare back. It always made me want to stare more. Most people stare back. I was worried about Francis getting blown up. I never imagined it was you that was in danger. I was busy worrying about Francis and never considered you could get murdered. How is it that you can have energies saturated into one hub and so easily, tune out, miss the other more important vibes? Maybe I could have prevented it. I think I have survivor’s guilt.  I feel utterly alone. I’m the only one in the world in a classroom of 25 kids, Penelope. I’m watching the snow falling almost a year later and thinking how weird that this same snow fell on us, in that one moment.  And Moran keeps talking about a thesis statement, how all the parts have to relate to the whole:  “The essay can’t stand on its own. It needs the framework; it needs the thesis to hold it up.” You are my thesis, Penelope. You are my framework.  I’m dissolving. The snow falls fast, hits the ground and sticks. I’m falling, too, inside Charles Pond High, in room 118 and three hours later, in my bedroom, typing on this computer, I’m still falling. I think I will dissolve and disappear and that will be okay. Then, at least, I can be closer to you. Let me dissolve. Let me go.

BEN’S WINK

November 25th
Penelope—
Happy Thanksgiving, Penelope. I’m not happy. I’m not thankful.  I was standing in the kitchen noticing that nothing was happening when Benny boy and Dorrie burst through the kitchen door. They were breathless, sweaty, hanging onto each other. It’s all so gross. They keep asking me to run with them. I keep saying no. Honestly, I don’t trust myself and think I might throw myself in front of a car. I don’t say this. Dorrie just stares at me, waiting. I think she can read my mind. I expected to smell a turkey cooking and ground celery and onions and giblets simmering. Instead, it was ice and fruit in a blender and talk about going out to eat on Thanksgiving (imagine?) and I was mad that they could be so happy so I said “That smells gross. Is the fruit rotten?” They just stood there, both of them, like coconspirators, staring me down. Dorrie smiled at me, smugly, and then went upstairs to take a shower, glass in hand. I wondered why she would carry the glass upstairs. She doesn’t make any sense at all. Ben sat right down next to me. Part of me was angry that he did it. But he’s like that, Penelope. He always makes time for me, always goes that extra mile. I don’t think I could ever be that selfless. In fact, I don’t deserve someone like Ben. You knew how to be selfless, Penelope. So, Benny boy sat there, waiting. It was awkward. So I brought up perjury, if a person has information that could change the outcome of a murder case, do they have to tell. He said, yes. “What if they don’t tell?” I asked. “They could be charged with obstructing justice and could do time in prison or pay a fine,” he said. He looked at me suspiciously (no surprise) and made me EXTREMELY nervous and I started to heat up, felt my face burn. I made up some excuse about needing to talk to Trudy Markus. I said she knew Penelope and wanted to tell me something. He asked if it might be something about the case. you know me, Penelope. I can’t lie. I don’t know why. It’s some defect built into my system. I said yes. He told me to let him know right away what happens. I told him I think she has important information.
 “Let me know right away, Seth, okay?”
“Okay. I will,” I told him. Then he sat there staring at me some more and it was awkward again. I decided to change the subject: “Do you think we will go out to eat for Thanksgiving?” 
 “I think so. Does that sound okay to you?”
“We’ve never done that.”
“First time for everything…that’s okay, right?
“I suppose.” Then Benny boy winked.  The guy likes to wink. I’ll confess, it’s not so bad when he winks at me. Ben’s winks are inspirational, hopeful, sum up life in one clean shot. I never knew a wink could do that. But with Benny boy it does. He gulped down the rest of his smoothie. I watched his adam apple move up and down. I felt his hand on my shoulder. He was sweaty, but I didn’t care. Most times, I cringe around sweaty people. You know me, Penelope. But Ben is different. I’ve gotten used to him. I’d say he’s like a comfortable pair of shoes. I think I should have felt more confused and freaked out but, instead, after our talk, I was feeling better somehow. I am looking forward to this day, to something spectacular.

TRUDY’S SUICIDE
November 26th
Penelope—
Winks lie. Trudy Markus tried to commit suicide. I was hopeful. But it didn’t last. It never does. We ate our Thanksgiving dinner at Trattoria’s. We had ravioli instead of turkey, and it was different and almost bearable—that is until we got home. We turned down our street. Ben was laughing at one of Dorrie’s corny jokes, and I was trying hard not to, but then it became silent and you could see the flashing lights. The police and ambulance and even the fire department were at the Markus’s house. It was surreal. I thought about it later, the irony, while we were eating pasta and pumpkin pie and laughing, Trudy was trying to die. You told me I shouldn’t trust her: she’s strange you said. But, she was my friend. I really liked her before she changed. While you were hanging out with Susanne and a few older kids from the neighborhood, ignoring me, I hung out with Trudy. We rode bikes around the cul-de-sac. She had a basketball hoop and we played H.O.R.S.E. Her mom invited me in a few times for brownies. The brownies were always warm and we’d eat them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. I loved the way it melted. Trudy’s mom was nice and smiled all the time. I only saw Trudy’s dad a couple of times and he was really tall and quiet like Abe Lincoln. Trudy looked just like her mom. It was after her parents were killed in the accident that Trudy changed. Death can do that. I know that now. She stopped riding her bike. I never saw her outside. Remember, Penelope, we would ride our bike up to Trudy’s house and hang around because you wanted to witness drama, hear some swearing and yelling? I never admitted it, but I didn’t like doing that. It made me feel creepy to spy on her. And, I didn’t tell you Penelope, but one time I went to the door.  I thought maybe she missed me and could use some company. I stood there for like five minutes ringing the bell. When she answered she looked tall and mean. She was wearing a black Tee-shirt with a skull on the front and she had dark make up under her eyes. “What the hell do you want?” she asked.  I didn’t say anything. I just ran away. What could I say?   
So, yesterday she tried to take some pills or hang herself. I’m not sure exactly. Ben told me all he knows. She’s alive. I might try to visit her.  I don’t know how she could WANT to kill herself. Penelope, you never wanted to die and you did. Trudy wanted to and she didn’t. I wonder if she’ll try again. If she does die, I hate to say it…but then Neal won’t have an alibi at all. Penelope, help me. I’m losing it. Winks suck.

Susanne we were way too hard on Trudy. I know. I’m guilty of it too.
Heather she gives me the creeps.  Maybe she was nice when she was young. But now she’s not very friendly.
@ heather you shouldn’t prejudge someone before you know them. Do you know Trudy? I do and I know she’s decent.

COWARD:  me


December 1st
Penelope—
I never did go to Trudy’s house. I couldn’t.  She took pills, according to Ben. I don’t know what kind. I should have gone to her house. But I didn’t. I’m an official coward, Penelope. You would tell me to go. I know you would. Chin up, Seth. I can’t get you out of my head. But now I have Trudy too, and she is different, she’s here, alive, right up the street, and I’m still thinking about her, and I’m wondering how she’s doing. I feel guilty for thinking about her so much. I think you are inside me, that you can read my thoughts. I’m sorry if you can. But I can’t stop.  I remember Trudy’s tangerine lip gloss, the way her puffy lips shimmered. I wonder how she is now. Maybe I made her want to die. I could have been the one to push her over the edge. I know if it were me, I’d have jumped off a cliff. No, I really don’t know how I’d do it. I’ve thought about it, killing myself, especially lately so I can be with you, Penelope. But I’m a coward. I’m too scared to even do that. Man I’m a coward.

MIXED ENERGY SIGNALS
December 2nd
Penelope--
I watch Trudy. I watch her walk by the house on her way to school. I hide in my usual spot, behind the curtain.  I know if she saw me she’d think I was a real psychopath. She’s not like you, Penelope. But there is something about her. I want to talk to her. I wish I wasn’t so scared all the time. I wish I had more courage like you, Pen. You would talk to anyone. Not me. I get shaky. I can’t breathe and then I walk away. It’s anxiety. I have way too much of it. People stare at me like I’m a lunatic. I don’t want to be crazy. I don’t know how to be normal.  Sometimes, I really do despise myself. I am the way I am. I can’t explain why. And really, it’s not like I hate myself like Trudy. I would never try to kill myself. I’m too scared. You used to say breath Seth, just breathe in and out. And Landau, he said it too but he told me to count to ten and all that crap. It worked for you because your voice made me calm. But I don’t believe a shrink. I think he makes money off people like me who are vulnerable. If he makes me better, I don’t need him, so what’s the incentive? I mean he needs a job. He’s not my friend. I think of Francis and how he has to dodge bombs and jump from airplanes. That makes me less afraid.  The thing is (like you told me) if I get mixed energy singles, I get overloaded and I can’t read the real message and I get confused. Remember Penelope when we read that article about the connection between stress and illness? Your immune system can be sabotaged from too many squiggly signals. Penelope, I need you. Please give a sign. I know if you were here, I could breathe okay. I think I’m dying inadvertently. I’m not ready. Not yet!  I want to live (I think).

THE FADED FUSCHIA
December 10th
Penelope—
I feel off. The weather is freaky, eerie. I didn’t see Trudy this morning. I need to see her. But it’s the weekend, so I won’t see her. I’m stuck on her. She is my latest obsession. You know me, Pen. I get fixated. I have to wait until Monday. And the weather is weird for December. The meteorologist reported an average temperature of 50 degrees for December. Today it was 65!  Ben and Dorrie convinced me to take a walk around Elizabeth Park. She caught me at the tail end of a contrived laugh (that’s all I can muster). “It will be good for you,” she and Benny said. They were begging. I thought to myself how would they know what is good for me? How would anyone but you know, Penelope? But I decided to go. I don’t know why. I guess I really wanted to be there—in the spot where you took your last breath. Morbid, I know. I wasn’t feeling scared, or sad, interestingly. I felt neutral, numb, like I was disconnected.  It was warm; the sun was shining and melting small patches of snow. We walked through the back entrance, off Prospect Avenue. Last winter was a record breaker. If it was last winter, we wouldn’t have a path to walk on.  I was thinking about all this stuff. But, I tried not to block the energy waves too much. I wanted to free up space to allow you in, Penelope. You were here just two months ago. You breathed your last breath a few feet from where I stood. You died violently. Your waves would be more concentrated in the place where you died.  Ben and Dorrie walked ahead of me, holding hands. Then we get closer to it, the spot, and I started to feel an increased numbness. I couldn’t move. I started to feel a tingling like an itch, a chill…something. Then I saw Trudy Markus, moving towards me, smoke lingering like a fog above her head. “What are you doing here?” I asked her when she was a few feet away. 
“Same thing you as you I guess.
 “You’re okay,” I said. 
 “What do you mean?” She looked perturbed.
“I mean, you didn’t die.”  I was so satirical, like you Penelope. I felt you inside me, imbibing energy, confidence.
“I’m here, right?”
“I don’t know. One can never know. Maybe you’re not really Trudy. Maybe you’re a ghost or an alien that has invaded Trudy Markus’s body.”  I was on a roll, Penelope. I never felt so confident.
 “Maybe,” she said.
“Penelope was murdered here, you know.” (I don’t know why I said it).
 “I know. I know. What about it?” she asked.
 “Residual energy pools in areas where there was a violent crime,” I said to her. I don’t know why I was saying these things to Trudy Markus.
 “I think you’re losing it, dude,” she said.
 “I don’t feel anything. I’m not sure why,” I confessed. 
 “Like I said, you’re losing it. There’s nothing to feel. It’s Elizabeth Park. It was Elizabeth Park before Penelope was murdered and it’s the same Elizabeth Park now that she’s dead.”
 “I don’t know about that. The energies remain behind and alter the atmosphere permanently,” I said.  
Trudy stared at me like I was a lunatic. She took a drag. Her cigarette looked like a thin cigar. She blew the smoke circles into the air. I watched the circles dissipate. And then you returned like a paused movie clip that resumed:
August—
The air is ripe with roses. We ride our bikes under an arch of reds and pinks and stop midway: You place your palm over the tops of the roses hanging off the arches: Oh my God! I LOVE this color! you shout. You were so excited. That was you, Penelope, always happy about small things.
 “It’s fuchsia.” I say. I watch you bend into the roses and inhale; your shirt lifts and I see your tanned back. I want to touch it. I feel a flutter of excitement which turns into a jarring like an electrical charge. I switch to facts. 
 “Did you know there are 800 types of roses in this park? 800 imagine?”
	 Wow!  No, I didn’t know that…the fuchsias are definitely my favorite.
 “Elizabeth Park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.”
	 Oh, yeah?
 “Yes.  There are 1500 plants and 102 acres. In 1894, Charles M. Pond bequeathed his estate to the city of Hartford but he requested it be named after his deceased wife, Elizabeth.” (I knew you would appreciate that. No one else would).
	Neat! I like that story. How do you know?
 “It’s on a plaque at the entrance. And we studied it in a community unit in fourth grade.”  
Oh, geez. I can’t remember that far back!           
 “You know our school is named after Charles Pond, right?”
	Yes! I know that much, brat!  
You throw a handful of fuchsia petals in my direction; the wind catches them and they float downward, slowly; you smile and ride off ahead of me, through the arch. I watch as you move further away from me, along the grass, standing as you pedal, your body moving up and down, your dark pony tail flipping side to side, framed in an arch of green and fuschia. I imagine wrapping my arms around your waist.  
I LOVE the fuschia! you shout again.
 I wonder what it means to love a color, or a rose. I want to love like you, Penelope. 
“Are you zoning out or what?” Trudy asked
 “I was just thinking about Penelope. It was vivid,” I admitted. It felt good telling Trudy. I’m not sure why.
“Well, time for reality, Mr. Seth Price”
I watched Trudy take another drag. Hang her head back and exhale slow and it was sensual. I thought that. I don’t know why. She walked away. I said “Bye” and she waved without turning back. I am intrigued by Trudy Markus. 
Today, after the fuschia fades, when the day has cooled and breath hangs like smoke in the air, and the roses wilt from too many frosts, I think of you, Penelope, how you will return to Elizabeth Park against your will. That was my last thought before I left Elizabeth Park. I love you, Penelope Rutherford. I know now. I know the electrical jolt, that jarring, was you, but I can’t do anything about it. I can only wait for more signs. Btw: You are my muse.
Seth

Jabberwocky9 HI! Cool blog, I know you were expecting something to happen at the park, but I agree with Trudy; it doesn’t always work that way. Chin up like Penelope used to say. Glad you saw Trudy. But you need to really TALK to her about YKW!!! The perjury issue is majorly important wouldn’t you say? I think you are digging Trudy. I think that’s cool too.
Heather Aw!  Thanks for sharing. And I’m not mad at you, even if you are rude to me.  I love Elizabeth Park. Maybe we can meet there one day? I agree with jabberwock9. You really should do something about that information. I saw you today at your locker. You seemed so lost. You looked frozen! You’ve missed so much school lately.  Sorry about calling you that name. I love your hair, btw.


ROCK:  me
December 11th
Penelope—
Trudy smokes thin brown cigarettes. I don’t think they are cigars. They have a nice cherry smell. If my window is open, I can smell her before I see her. I watch her every day now walking past. I think I will try to talk to her tomorrow. The problem is when I think of it, I start to shake. I’m a freak who can’t walk or talk. I’m a rock. Only you made me move, Penelope. I need you to charge me up. I’ve been staying home from school so much that Dorrie hired a tutor, Don Banks. He’s old and British sounding. He called me bewildering. I guess because I don’t talk. Why should I talk? Words are for the living.

STALKER:   me

December 13th
Penelope—
I think I’m a stalker.  Today, I went to the grocery store with Ben to buy brownie mix and whipped cream—Dorrie's request. I actually planted the seed because I had been thinking about Trudy’s mom and her warm brownies.  Well, point being, guess who was at the checkout?  TRUDY!  It must be fate that or she is sending me signals. She has been stuck in my head. Penelope. I don’t know if it’s because of the perjury or the attempted suicide or something else. I walked past Trudy and she was wearing a gold tee-shirt with the Shopping Bag logo on the left side and a name tag on her right side.   But she was looking down and didn't see me and then I heard your voice chin up, Seth and then go so I did. I said she looked bright in her gold shirt. Honestly, it was a putridly gaudy color and you’d agree, Penelope (I didn’t say that). She looked up and made a weird face at me and raised her eyebrows as if she didn't hear me.  
 “I didn't know you worked at Shopping Bag,” I said.	
 “Well I didn't exactly broadcast it.”
	“Do you like this job?” I asked her.
	“Love it. It's my dream, you know, to be head cashier, move up to management so I can wear the purple shirt,” she answered in her smug-Trudy manner.
	“You’ll do it.” After I said this she laughed and shook her head.  
 “Listen, I'm busy dude can't talk now,” she said, and I sensed she was done with me, but it didn’t matter. I was relentless, Penelope. 
“I was just wondering why you were with Neal that night? Do you really like Neal?”
	“I gotta work now.”
	“I’m your only customer.”
	“Then buy something and I’ll ring you up.”
	“You’re not busy.”
	“That's a matter of perspective.”
	“So in your perspective, you are busy?”	
“I think I am so I am. And stalkers who aren’t buying anything need to go away.”
 That was my cue. I walked away from the checkout, towards the center of the store. I stood in front of displays of Black Diamond tuna on sale for $1.29 a can and apple juice, store brand for $ 1.99 and waited for Benny boy to rescue me. Penelope, I don’t know if I ever told you this, but when I was little I used to like to walk up and down the aisles and touch the rows of cans and jars and boxes. I'd blink my eyes till the images blurred into a stream of light and colors. I felt a surge of vibrations from the fluorescent lights. I really did.  Now, I needed to stand and wait because I lost Ben and I wasn’t sure what else to do. I can't do the things I want to do like touch the buttons on the coffee bean grinder or scan items on the self-checkout.  Besides, Trudy called me a freak and a stalker. I felt weird after that. Maybe I am a freak.  I mean who spends time blogging to a dead person? (sorry Penelope) I figured if I stood very still and didn’t move no one would notice me. I decided I'd look up stalker when I got home. Trudy is smart. She talks fast, mutters, uses language in weird ways. It confuses me when people do that. It takes time for me to process what people say and what they really mean. I hate that about me. It was so easy with you, Penelope. I looked up stalker. Yes, I like to know the precise definition and it always drove you crazy, Pen. 
Stalker: 
a.A stem or main axis of a herbaceous plant
b.A stem or similar structure that supports a plant par such as a flower…
Source:  Free Online Dictionary
Then right underneath I found Psycho stalker and the legal definition:
	Criminal activity consisting of the repeated following and harassing of another person.
Obviously, Trudy meant the second definition. Maybe I am a stalker. I do spy on her. Maybe she knows I do it! Penelope, I’m finding myself fixated on a real person. I don’t see a problem fixating on the inanimate or the deceased (sorry) but, I mean, Trudy is real. I wish you were still real, Pen.  I wish you were somewhere else besides in my head. I wish I could touch you. I would do it.  I would touch you and kiss you and press you against me and tell you I loved you.  I don’t think that makes me a stalker.

MY DESIRE
December 16th
Penelope—
I saw Trudy outside this morning @ 7:03 A.M..  I was unusually brave. I’ve been getting a ride to school, so I had to come up with an excuse for Dorrie. She’s always on me lately.  I said I needed to get information from a friend. Of course she asked, who, and I had to tell her WHO!  And then she looked at me mistrustfully and I got mad because she’s a hypocrite and it's not fair that anyone should be judged based on appearances. So I told her to take her own advice for once, not to judge a book by its cover, and she said fine, just be careful. And that was that. I love it when Dorrie is resigned. Honestly, I don't think I could be so easy going and that's why I might never have kids. I like being right too much. So I ran outside and had to catch up with Trudy. I shouted to her but she kept walking. But after the second shout, she stopped and turned.      
 “What do you want?” she asked in a not-you-again tone.
“I have a question” I said. I wasn’t caving.
	“What else is new?”
	“What do you mean?”
	 “Forget it!  What is your question?
	“Do you know Neal is going to be convicted?” I got right to the point. 
	 “Highly doubtful,” she said.
	“Do you know he has no alibi and he's the prime suspect?”
“He has a good lawyer. He'll get off,” she insisted.
 	 “Get off?”
	 “Be acquitted. He'll be acquitted, found not guilty? In fact, it probably won't go to trial.” 
	 “I think it could. Then what will you do?”
“I talked to Neal and he's not concerned. So, I’m not either.” She was so damn smug. But I liked it.
 “That's crazy! How could he not be concerned?  Does he want to go to prison?  Or maybe he really did it and feels guilty. That's it. He must be guilty! I think you’re lying.” I was shaking at this point.
	“You're a complete dolt.  Of course he didn't murder anyone. Neal is definitely not a murderer.”
	“How do you know?” I was shaking and excited from the intensity. 
	 “I know, believe me. He was with me like I said.”
	 “Why don’t you tell? Why? I don’t understand how you could keep this a secret and then expect me to do the same?”	
“Ok. That’s it. I’m done talking.”
Trudy reached into her pocket and took out one of her brown cigarettes. She flicked a Zippo lighter with a Pac Man design and lit it. I never saw a lighter with a Pac Man design. The smoke blew right up my nose and burned. I liked it. I really wanted to hold the lighter, check out the design. You know me, Penelope. I get easily distracted by these things. But when I asked, she rolled her eyes and slipped it into her pocket. Then she started walking quicker. I switched back to the topic of Neal and she told me to get the hell away so I crossed the street and walked on the other side. 
I am not sure how she could think Neal will get off.  But it bothered me all day. I kept thinking about Trudy smoking her brown cigarettes, her head thrown back, blowing smoke rings up into the air, that Pac Man lighter. I decided that I definitely needed to see her again. That's how I am. I mean I know I don’t like to be wrong and I do get stuck on a thing.  But I hope I’m not a stalker. I really hope I’m not. I wonder if stalkers know it. Penelope, please help me. I don’t want to be a criminal. I’m waiting for a sign. I’m sorry if you think I’m crazy, but I suddenly feel a tremendous need to be with Trudy. I think she is pulling me away from you. And this makes me feel guilty and slightly off kilter.

THE VISIT

December 16th
Penelope—
Benny boy wants to talk. He comes into my room and stands by the window. He does this every morning lately. He just stands there. What a buffoon. He asks how I’m doing, talks about the sun setting, the bad weather or some other trivial matter like how he wants to get the book shelf finished for Dorrie as a Christmas gift, and would I consider helping him. Today, he came in and talked about your house, Penelope. “Looks like the Rutherford’s finally put their Halloween decorations away and got some lights on their tree,” he said to me. I didn’t mention the Nativity scene because he wouldn’t have remembered it.  He wouldn’t know how we used to set it up together. I wasn’t going to mention it either. What’s the point?  He just stood there waiting for me to say something. Then he said “You might want to consider visiting the Rutherfords. I’m sure they’d love to see you, Seth.” I didn’t say a word. I could tell he was being careful. He looked at me with this stupid dreamy expression. I couldn’t discern. I’m tired of trying to figure out what someone is feeling, thinking, wanting from me. 
But when he walked out of the room, I started thinking about the Nativity scene. And then I thought about what would make you happy, Penelope. Benny boy’s ploy worked.
 I went to your house. I was numb when I walked up to your door. I don’t recall most of it. It’s the only way I could do it.  I rang the bell. I imagined your footsteps, your voice yelling COME IN!  Instead, it was your mom. She was old looking, older than I remember, Penelope, as if she forgot to wash her face, or put on makeup, or whatever it is old people do to look decent. At first I wanted to run.  She was staring at me with this strange look on her face.  Her eyes were wide and her mouth was open; she looked the same but different. I’m sorry to say these things Penelope. But it’s the truth. Here’s the gist of the conversation (after the initial small talk):
“I was wondering about the Nativity scene,” I said.
“Oh, well, I guess we just didn't get to it this year, Seth.” Her voice cracked when she said this, and I felt like I wanted to turn and run. I sensed she was going to break down right in front of me.
	 “I thought I could help you with it.”
	“Help with what?”
	“I could help with the Nativity scene.  I helped Penelope set it up last year and the year before.”
	 “Yes...that's right. Penelope was the one to remind us about it. She loved it.” 
	“I could set it up.” 
	“You could set it up?” she asked in a foggy way as if she were disconnecting.	
 “Yes. I could do it for you.”
	“Oh, I see. Well that is a nice gesture, Seth. And I think Penelope would want that.  I think she would. So, why don't you come by on Saturday? We won’t be home but I'll leave the shed unlocked for you. Do you know where it's kept?”
	“Yes. I know. I helped Penelope a couple of times.”
 “I guess you did. I don't doubt it. Penelope was so fond of you, Seth.” 
I wasn't sure what else to say then so I said goodbye and left her standing at the doorway. I just left her there, Penelope. I left your mom alone like I left you, that night you rode off by yourself to the dance. I should have been with you. I watched you go, alone. I shouldn’t have let you go alone. She was still there when I turned back. She was frozen or something. I decided it was an overload of negativity associated with loss that made her shut down. She would never be the same. Nothing would ever be normal for me or your family. I decided I would help with the Nativity scene, but I never wanted to go back there again. I hope you forgive me, Penelope.

Susanne I thought you’d appreciate this one from Pen.
Hi, Suz!
I feel so weird. Seth and I set up the Nativity and it was making me so sad for some reason. I didn’t tell Seth. But it was a weird feeling. I felt as if it was our last time. I don’t know why!  After he left, I was bawling. What is the matter with me, Suz? Do you think I’m depressed? I just love Seth. I think of him as a brother. I hate that I’m an only child. After he left, I felt so incredibly lonely! Come over tonight. Please!!! We can make rice crispy treats.  I need some company.  Neal has been so annoying. I don’t want him anywhere near me. And Suz if you don’t come over I might be tempted to text him. Seth isn’t picking up his phone!!! I think he’s out somewhere.
Hugs,  Pen
@susanne she had a premonition. I’m not surprised. I wish I was there for her.

BROKEN 
December 17th
am
Penelope—
I’m a failure. I broke down on your front lawn. After attempting to eat a bowl of cereal, and enduring Ben and Dorrie’s assault of praise for my “good deed” I walked over to 19 Bretton Road—your house. I kept thinking about the email, how you felt the last time we set it up, how you needed me that night and I didn’t pick up my phone. I was feeling off right from the start. In fact if someone was home, I might have said I was sick. But I had to stay, to stick it out. I opened the shed in the backyard. I found the pieces exactly where you and I left them last year in the corner of the shed, covered with a green wool blanket. You refused to use a plastic tarp. Instead, you went inside and brought out a wool blanket from the closet. I said you were nutty. I took off the blanket remembering that you were the last one to touch it. I folded it nicely and placed it down next to the pieces. I carried each piece out to the front of the yard, next to the spotlight.  I wanted to make sure each one got special treatment. That’s what you told me to do. I heard your voice in my head:  my Aunt Julia made these and she’s very religious and had each sculpture blessed and everything. God knows what would happen if one were to break, you had said.  I brought out the Manger and saved the Baby Jesus for last like we always did.  I lifted him up and (here’s where it gets weird) I noticed his left hand was broken off. My heart pounded. My head was spinning. I had to find the hand. The air turned into spots and I could barely focus. And then I found it concealed under a piece of the wool blanket. I bent down and picked it up. My thoughts raced. I needed to get out of the shed. I couldn’t breathe. I was convinced I made you die. The broken hand was an omen. Penelope, I had a freak out right there in your yard. I ran, and I mean ran, to the front yard. I collapsed down next to the Nativity scene. A sharp piece of the broken hand pierced my palm. I pressed harder. I liked it, Penelope. I liked the pain. I deserved the pain. I deserved to bleed. I wanted to die. I wanted to be with you, Penelope. That’s exactly what I was thinking. I would have cut my wrist but I didn’t know how to do it.  I thought I should be dead. It was a major brain glitch, an overload; I rocked back and forth like an idiot, holding the Baby Jesus, the broken hand stuck in my palm, and I knew I couldn’t fix it so I just sat there frozen. And at some point, the sky turned grey and sleet pricked my cheeks like pins, and I felt a presence. I was convinced it was you. I even smelled you. I could sense you standing next to me. I called to you “Penelope?” And then I felt your hand on my shoulder and I looked up and I saw you standing over me. I would have bet my life on it being you. But then it was someone else. “Come on, dude. What are you doing? It’s cold out here.  Let’s go.” I looked up then and saw Trudy Markus.
 “NO! I can’t! It’s broken! See? Don’t you see?” I held out the broken hand like some sacrifice, smeared with my blood. Part of me was, I guess, mad the other was…I don’t know. I can’t explain.
 “It’s okay. It’s okay.  I have some glue, Seth. Chill dude. We can fix it. Let’s go get some glue, Seth.”
 “No, I broke it. You don’t understand. I can’t fix it. Penelope told me not to break it! But I grabbed it… I didn’t care…I grabbed it quick before she could get it… I must have broken it. I did it! Why did I do that?  It’s broken because of ME!  It’s all because of ME!  I KILLED HER! IT WAS ME!  I HATE ME!  I HATE ME! I WANT TO DIE! KILL ME! PLEASE KILL ME!” I screamed. I pounded the ground with my fists.  I couldn’t stop, Penelope. It was as if another person had crawled inside me. I had no control over what happened next. And Trudy Markus stood there, befuddled, watching me and I didn’t care what I did or said. Then, she crouched down next to me. She sat there with me. She didn’t talk. She didn’t move. She didn’t touch me. Her arms were crossed. She just sat there next to me. She was present, in that place with me, and I thought of the riddle you taught me: do you know how to find something that can’t be found?  Answer: get yourself lost.  Trudy Markus got lost to find me. I was in there, somewhere. And she knew how to do it, to bring me back the way you did, Penelope. 
Then I heard another voice behind me. Trudy stood and moved behind me. They talked in hushed tones. I knew it was about me. It was your dad, Mr. Rutherford. They kept talking. I waited for an ambulance. Instead, he walked over to me. He put his hand on my shoulder, told me “Come on now, get up.” I followed. I did it because he sounded like a father, one I never had. He took me into the bathroom. He washed my cut and then and covered it with a Band-Aid. We fixed the Baby Jesus’s hand with cement glue. I sat at the kitchen table with the yellow and purple flowered cloth and the wooden bowl filled with plastic grapes and apples and bananas. It was all the same, Penelope, all the same.  Except this time your dad sat in your chair and we drank hot chocolate with whipped cream (not marshmallows), and I talked about my electromagnetic wave theory and Leedskalnin’s Coral Castle Museum in Homestead Florida. And then your mom walked in and she smiled (you know the way she does) and thanked me and she looked like she used to before, when you were alive, with lipstick and everything. I told them both I miss you, and that it is weird that you are not here anymore. They agreed. And then I walked home.  
pm
I always settle for ordinary. I hate that about me. But dinner saved me--the ordinary, the predictable. After dinner, I walked to your house to see the Nativity scene in the spot light. It was the same, Penelope. I felt you there, standing right beside me, looking.  I’m so sorry I broke it, but really, Penelope, no one will know. So, I happen to look up the street towards Trudy Markus’s home. I can’t help it. I wonder what she is doing. I hope she’s not taking pills.  I think of how she helped me. You know what I think Penelope? Trudy is a kind person. Beneath all of it, she has a good heart. She is the Trudy I once knew. I like Trudy Markus more than I can say. I want to thank her, hug her, and tell her she is a good friend to be so nice. I have to be honest, Penelope. These are my real thoughts. Then I think of how she might hate me now. How ridiculous I must have looked—crying like a baby. I wonder if she will report me to the authorities, say I am unstable. It is the way it is with me. I was born this way. I have accepted it. I move forward because the alternative is too dark to imagine. So, I walked back home and back to the ordinary parts of my life:  a conversation with good old Benny boy, dessert, me poking at brownie crumbs with my fork, Dorrie making coffee—these are my places now Penelope. 
Tonight Ben talked about Neal Lourdes, and it felt good because facts are safe. He told me that Neal Lourdes was disturbed and was a foster kid before he was adopted. I figure foster kids must feel broken all the time. I told him that you didn’t want to be with Neal anymore. I remember how you said I don’t know how to get rid of him just a week before it happened. I remember it clearly: we were sitting on the couch eating jelly beans and drinking Dr. Pepper. I don’t remember if I told detective Joe that. Neal was texting you and you didn’t want to respond. He’s a lunatic you said and you refused to text back. He could easily be understood as guilty. But now I know. I know but I don’t tell. I should tell, but then the ordinary will disappear.

Heather  so sad. I can relate, Seth. I have had my own share of freak outs. Miss you!  I  pm’d you a poem

@heather please keep your poetry. Thanks but no thanks. I don’t have time for sappy poetry.

WAVES


December 18th
 Penelope—
I saw you this morning. You were standing next to the Nativity scene.  I know it was you. You turned and looked up at me. I waved to you. But you didn’t wave back. My heart raced. I felt my body move outward. I looked away, rubbed my eyes. When I looked back you were gone. Maybe I’m hallucinating. I don’t think so. I believe it is you. According to my wave theory, we are all ephemeral in the physical sense. But our waves remain behind. Waves can be one of three:  positive, negative or neutral. Positive waves are no more intensely felt than negative. Penelope, you died on the day you were born, October 30th which was a powerful positive. You were murdered. The negative waves from the murder were overridden by the positive waves—one is negated by the other.  But the waves are present even after your death:  that chill at the base of my neck is you. The other day when I misplaced my sweatshirt and found it on the front step—you.  Another thing, Penelope, you always played tricks on me. Your favorite candy was jelly beans, especially the black ones. Ever since you died, I find black jelly beans everywhere—under the couch, on the kitchen floor, on the rug in my bedroom. I keep them in a jar on my desk. I know your energy is with me. So for the first time, today, after a session with Don Banks, I walked to St. Benedict’s Cemetery, and I stood by your marker, ran my hands over the inscription. Your marker is pink granite like the jetty at the beach. You would like it. It says: 
CHERISHED
MEMORIES OF
PENELOPE RUTHERFORD
BORN 30TH OF OCTOBER, 1994
DIED 30TH OF OCTOBER 
Blossomed On Earth To Bloom in Heaven.

I waited for you. But you never came. So, I read the inscription a few times. I said it like a prayer. I wondered how you could get any better than you were on earth.  Then again, the inscription is simple and true. You always preferred simple. It’s so unfair. Your murder was anything but simple. It was complex. You were tricked, deceived, consumed. You were swallowed by the darkness. For a moment you felt it, pure unadulterated evil. I walked back home. Then I felt you. I know you are here with me. I’m convinced of it now.  I’m euphoric with the feel of you.

Heather so nice. That gave me shivers.

BODY
December 19th
Penelope—
I’m going to tell you. I can do it now. You are with me. I’m convinced you hear me and will lead me to your murderer. I need to give you the clues. I can do it now. I am your portal; I imbibe your energy which gives me the confidence, and the strength to do it. I’m ready to tell. Here are the events that occurred the morning your body was found:
Mrs. Green walks her dog Lilly, a small grey schnauzer @ 6:45 Saturday morning in Elizabeth Park. Meanwhile, no one was looking for you because you were never reported missing. Your parents believed you spent the night at Susanne’s. And Susanne, on the other hand, thought you hooked up with Neal and decided not to go to the dance. She ignored the unanswered texts she sent to you because, as she was quoted saying: “Penelope would always do this to me when she went back to Neal. She didn’t want me to know, because I’d yell at her.”Mrs. Green walks Lilly every morning at 6:45 and has been doing it for five years without any strange occurrences. This would change for her on October 31st   at 7:05 a.m. (approximately) Mrs. Green sees the bike first. She spots the gleam of the chrome fender shining in the sun.  Maybe Lilly barks. Something seems off, so she moves in closer, glances down the side of the bank. And that’s when she finds you. Your body is mud-caked. Your arms are spread with palms turned upwards. And your legs are slightly bent, partially submerged in the brook. You’re wearing your red converse sneakers. One sneaker is untied, the lace undulating in the brook like the string we used for crabbing. Your sweatshirt is pulled up revealing your stomach. Your jeans are unzipped. When interviewed, Mrs. Green said:  “Horrible…I saw her bike. It didn’t look right…I mean it looked as if it were tossed…then I saw the body…her face…that poor girl…. …unimaginable...I walk my dog this same route every morning…never a roblem…never….lived in this neighborhood all my life.  She was such a pretty girl. Her face was like an angel. I’ll never forget that face, never.” The police collect evidence—Your body, bike, backpack with a Dr. Pepper, unopened, that you would never drink, and your costume you would never wear—a hippy wig with John Lenin glasses, a peace sign and a vest. You liked peace signs. You had a couple tee-shirts with peace signs. You sewed peace signs onto your jeans like they did in the 70’s. Why someone who loved peace so much could die so violently I don’t know. Help me Penelope. Help me find your murderer.

Susanne  too painful to even read. Why do you torture yourself, Seth? Please contact me. Pen would want you to. I know she would.
@susanne you don’t know her anymore.  She is with me. 


RECEPTIVE
December 20th
Penelope—
I thought of this today:  ingesting energy happens every day. Each time you interact with an energy source, you ingest some of it.  But you have to be receptive. I have received you, Penelope and you are with me now. That makes me feel a sense of peace. Christmas is supposed to be joy and peace. But, really, it makes me empty; I fixate on Emmet, the dad I don’t know. I don’t remember Emmet. I have one photograph. We are standing by the jetty at White Sands. He is holding me in his arms. I have studied this one photo down to the minutest of details; I know every shadow, every crease. We all look healthy, tanned, sun bleached hair. Dorrie and Emmet are leaning into each other. They are so close, they could be one person. Emmet is handsome. He has no shirt on. He is trim and athletic. Dorrie is smiling. But Emmet is not. His mouth is partly open just like mine. Our expressions are identical. Francis is not in the photo. He is hiding underneath the cottage because he has a fever. I suppose I don’t mind at all if I never know Emmet Price. Still, I think I am part of him and he is part of me, because I came from him.  I know this because when I see an image that could be art (stones, water, trees, people), I think I could paint it, and I think it is sent from him. I am the recipient. I am open to it. I believe he is looking at the same image at precisely the same time.  I don’t know what he paints. I don’t know why he paints.  I don’t know where he is.  
But as I was saying, Penelope, I know you are with me. People (your average person) would think I was a lunatic if I talked about ingesting people, or my wave theory, so I don’t say anything, especially to Dr. Landau. He already questions my sanity. I can tell by the way he studies me, jots down my words. I tried once to talk to him about the waves. He changed the subject. Some people like Landau have a block; it’s like a wall. Landau was trained to keep his thoughts on select channels and anything outside of those channels is rejected. All unseen particles of energy, in these cases, are explained away as earthly dust or atoms or gases.  People with firewalls are asleep. They block any energy that could affect them in either positive or negative ways; they fear vulnerability. They like to be powerful so they feed off false energy—an inflated sense of self that they are convinced was formed entirely separate from their environment and the people around them. But I know my inner core is altered and evolving repeatedly by external waves. It’s an important concept to first know and second to accept if you want to evolve and improve awareness. After I considered all this, I went downstairs.  Dorrie was not her usual perky. She seemed concerned, said she talked to Dr. Landau and he would like me to start on some medication. “He thinks you’re depressed,” she told me. Has he mentioned it to you?” I told her I didn’t recall. Then I left her standing there in the kitchen, holding a fruit smoothie. She is in a bad place lately. Mothers worry far too much as far as I’m concerned. I would say, if anyone, she needs the medication.
pm
I’m going to try to walk to school with Trudy tomorrow. Only a few more days left before break. Then I won’t see her for a week. I want to thank her and tell her that she needs to talk to the police. I thought of that this morning. It was you, Penelope. You are trying to keep me safe. Thank you, Penelope. Thank you for looking out for me. No one else would do that.

COMMENTS
Susanne Seth, please call me. I left my number. I wanted to talk to you. I feel badly that we haven’t connected. Please call. We can have lunch on Saturday.
@susanne  busy sorry.
Heather Wow! I do believe we are all interconnected, Seth. But I’m still trying to grasp your wave concept.  Do think there is no higher power like God or the other guy (ykw) that influences what we think and what we do?  Is it all about this energy that emanates off objects and people? Also, I’m not sure what you mean by Penelope being with you. Please explain.
Jabberwocky9 My girlfriend and I always complete each other’s sentences. I can tell when she is going to call before she calls because I get a sense. My sense now is that you need to listen to your mom and your dr.
Anonymous CHILL you are headed for a stay in a psych ward. 
@heather  of course there is a grand design that exists, some mysterious and divine origin. So, yes, I believe in God. Better to err on the side of caution when it comes to matters of God.

THE TALK
December 23rd
 
am

Penelope—

I barely slept. I skipped breakfast. I don’t eat much anymore. Food is superfluous. You are giving me words. I feed off your words. I can go without food. Ghandi did it. I can too. I looked out saw you in your bedroom window. I know it was you. The blinds were open. You were looking out at me. I waved. I think you were giving me the thumbs up to talk to Trudy.  In fact, I know it. Here’s why:  I saw Trudy at 7:05 a.m., the same time Mrs. Green found your body. I think it’s significant. She looked over at me and sped up. I walked faster. She was smoking her brown sticks. 
“Is that a cigar,” I shouted after her.
	“Pardon?”
	“Are you smoking cigars?”
	“No, it’s a cigarette.”
	 “Why do you smoke that kind?”	
 “I like the flavor and it's cheaper.”
	 “What is the flavor?”	
 “Cherry. Richmond.”
 “Yummy…but really you should quit.”
 “But really you should stop harassing me.”	
 “I’m not a stalker. Why did you call me a stalker?”
 “I didn’t call you a stalker. I said you were harassing me.” 
 “Not now but before you did. At the grocery store, remember?”
 “No, I can’t say I do. I don’t even remember what I said this morning let alone a couple days ago.”  
 “Okay, okay. Hey, I really just wanted to say thanks for helping me at the Rutherfords.”
 “Sure. No problem, dude. You were wacked out a bit there. What happened? Did you swallow the wrong meds?”
 “Ha, funny, but for real do you think you will go to the police soon?”
“Christ, you really know how to turn a nice conversation into shit.”
“Well, are you going to go or not?”
“Hold on there, dude. You’re not gonna freak out on me are you? I just can’t take it right now, please, not this early in the morning.”
 “No. I’m not. I just need to know that’s all.”
“Well, I don’t know. So how’s that?”
She turned away. I wanted to ask her about Neal. But she was too fast. I yelled, goodbye. She raised her arm up without turning around. That’s the way she does it. Her Richmonds hung in the air, cherry, a nice burnt cherry smell. I liked it. 
I really think I’m drawn to Trudy Markus. She is so different from you, Penelope. Trudy gets to the point and she’s what one might refer to as blunt. She doesn’t like small talk. I don’t either. I don’t think she likes too many people, especially fake ones.  I'm not a big fan of people either. I tend to like people more if they have something to offer me. Otherwise, I don’t feel the need to be with my peers. I'm thinking I could hang out with Trudy. It gets my mind off you, Pen. And I think she can help us find your murderer. 
pm

I saw you again, Penelope. You were standing by the shed. You had on your green sweatshirt, the one you wore on the day of the dance. But, I didn't see Trudy It was 3:15 and I waited to see her walking home. I was feeling good, and now I’m feeling strange like something is missing or gone awry. My moods are unpredictable. But, it’s Christmas break and that means I have to wait to see Trudy. I’m tired of waiting. I don’t care about Christmas and presents and all the crap that goes with it. I want to see Trudy. I don’t even care if I’m a stalker! Next time I see you, Pen, I hope I can touch you. I need to touch you. If I could touch Trudy, that might suffice.

NORMAL
December 24nd
Penelope—
It’s Christmas Eve, and I haven’t seen Trudy, and I’m probably a stalker and I’m failing most of my classes. Don Banks is no help. He keeps telling me stories about Viet Nam and the time he lived in London. I just pretend to listen. I didn’t see you today. I need you, your advice. Like I said, I’m failing my classes. I’m waiting for the talk from Dorrie. Ben may chime in too. It hasn’t happened yet. But it will. I’m smart. I know that. I can easily be a straight A student, if I tried. It’s not that I’m weird like outcasts who are rebelling. It’s not like that. You know me, Penelope. All I know is that I think I’m fairly normal and never needed a therapist or help in school—that is, before you died. I never needed a therapist. But after you were gone Penelope and Francis left, I crashed. I couldn’t focus—all that stuff you need to do in school. I’m not depressed, really. Well, maybe I am in a normal way. But I’m not in the clinical way. I mean who wouldn’t be depressed after losing a best friend? So, Landau said he will give me coping strategies. I told him about my blog. He warned me to be careful. Not sure what he meant by that. Anyway, I agreed to consider medication. It will placate Dorrie. Actually, I don’t think I’m defective or suffering from any disorder. And everything has been going okay. I didn’t tell him the times I see you Penelope. It’s our secret, k?

Jabberwocky9 It can’t hurt, Seth. I love my therapist--she rocks.  She's a vegan and really open minded, even though she wears leather shoes. We go to the movies. It can work you have to shop around!!!  I don’t take any medication now but I’ve taken Ritalin when I was younger. 
Heather I think Landau means you are blogging to a dead person and this can become dangerous. Are you really seeing Penelope?  You do realize you can’t be actually seeing her if she’s dead, right?
@heather yes, I do see her. She is not gone. She visits me. You need to open your mind.

MEDICATION


December 23rd
Penelope—
So I agreed to start medication. It is my first day. I’m waiting for something momentous to occur. I don’t feel anything. I just feel tired. I want to sleep and sleep. But that could be from being up most of the night. I wrote out a list of things I could say to Trudy. I know you were helping me Penelope. I felt you beside me, guiding me. I think I need to say the right things. She can help me. I’m sure of it. Don Banks will be here in a few minutes. (ttly)

THE ARREST

December 25th


Penelope—
Merry Christmas, Pen. My head feels heavy. Dorrie said it’s definitely not the meds. They don’t work that fast. How does she know? How does anyone know for sure? Nothing is absolute. I used to trust her. Now, I’m skeptical. Neal Lourdes was arrested. Ben told me this morning. It was before I came downstairs, before I saw you sitting on the edge of my bed. You were there. You smiled at me. It was just as I was waking. I sat up quick. I grabbed your hand. It was warm. You kept smiling but your eyes seemed sad like before. You rubbed my hand. Then you were gone. Why did you leave? Why are you sad?  We are getting closer to the truth, Penelope. Neal’s alibi fell through. Neal insisted he was at home. But, his alibi aka parents were at a Broadway show in New York City. The neighbors were questioned, claimed that Neal’s Harley Davidson and Ford pick-up truck were not in their usual spots in the driveway. He claims the truck was at the shop and the bike was parked in back. He may be able to post bail (depending on the judge). Ben told me that if he is considered a risk to the community, he will have to remain in jail until his trial.  Here’s what we discussed, after the facts:
“Will he be in jail for Christmas?”
 “Yes, most likely.”
 “They don’t wait until after the holidays?”
 “It doesn’t work that way, Seth.”
 “How long will they keep in jail?”
 “It depends on the judge.”
 “What type of judge denies bail?”
 “One that decides Neal Lourdes is a high risk for not returning to court, and a danger to the community.”
 “But what type?”
 “A conservative type, I suppose.”
“What if the judge is liberal?”
“Then maybe Neal will be allowed to post bail but will probably be on house arrest with electronic monitoring.”
 Some part of me hopes the judge is a liberal type. I don’t know why. What do I care? Penelope you were my best friend. I should want the murderer, if it is Neal, to suffer. The thing is, I don’t know for sure it’s him. And, Penelope, you wouldn’t want him to suffer. So I don’t either. 
I can’t find Trudy. Now, I really need her. I really really really need to talk to her. I need you too, Penelope. Please come back. I need to see you. Just one hit of you will charge me up.
Seth
COMMENTS
2cents Hey, they got him, dude. What else do you want?   If he murdered someone, he shouldn’t be released back into the community. That’s total BS. I knew Neal. Believe me. He most likely did it. And Trudy is lying for attention. I know her type. Btw:  those meds could be making you hallucinate.
Heather I understand why you’re conflicted, Seth It’s hard to imagine. Try to enjoy your Christmas. Life is inexplicable. The reasons for good and evil are not always so clear. 
@heather you don’t know a thing about me. NO one does. Only Penelope knows me, really knows me.
@2cents no, I’m not.

MEETING MANNY


December 26th
am
Penelope—
I woke up gasping for air. I don’t remember any nightmare. I’m convinced it’s the meds. Dorrie said no. I told her I’m calling Dr. Landau. Neal was arrested. I can’t get it out of my head. I may go to Trudy’s. It’s 8:00 at night. I know that sounds insane. But my skin is burning. Maybe it’s the meds. Maybe it’s my anxiety.  I need air. I knew it. I knew his alibi would fall through. I want to talk to Trudy. I can’t stop thinking about it. What if he goes to prison? She knows he’s not guilty. How could she do that?  How could I? I’m not sure what to do now. I have so many squiggly lines. I see them everywhere. The air is fuzzy, filled with lines. And I want to know why does my skin feel so hot? I’m sure it is this medication.  I think I could die from the confusion. The news doesn’t help: shootings, murders, kidnappings, terrorist threats and home invasions. I’m off today. My mind is prickly if that’s even possible.
pm
So, I met Manny. He’s tall and skinny. He has dark hair pulled back in a ponytail and tattoos on any exposed flesh, one crawling up his neck. I heard them, laughing, coughing, smelled the smoke. He was with Trudy, in front of my house. I bolted out the door. I was manic. Even if I wanted to change my mind, it would have been too late.  Initially, I thought Trudy heard the news and was afraid I’d go to the police tell, so she invited Manny over to intimidate me. He looked ominous. Even so, I had to confront him. Go you said. I heard you, Penelope. So I did.  
“Hey!”  I shouted.
 “Hey dude,” Trudy said.
 “Who are you?”  I looked right at him.
 “Manny. Who are you?”
 “This is Seth Price. He’s a friend of mine. He’s cool.”
 “Oh, I see. Well now…does Sethy poo like to party?” Manny asked. 
I wanted to punch him. I wanted to get out of there. I hated him. I hated Trudy, how she betrayed me, standing there, smugly, staring down at me like I was an idiot.
 “Why don’t you shut up, Manny because if you don’t, you can get the hell outta here, and buy your own shit.”
 “Ok, ok. Chill,sweetie pie.” He grabbed Trudy’s shoulders, looked over at me: “She’s a live wire, huh?” 
Trudy shook him off of her. “Let go of me you dolt.”  
 “Hey, I’m just playing with you. I appreciate my Christmas present, I do. I do.  You know me, right?” 
I wanted to ask about his Christmas present, but I didn’t. I figured it was drugs. I told Trudy I needed talk to her, but that it could wait. I got out of there. I didn’t want to witness a doped-up ex-con get violent. When I walked away, I heard them laughing. I heard Trudy say shut up. I heard Manny say what the hell is wrong with him? I don’t know if they were laughing at me or something else. I don’t care anymore. Manny is insignificant. Manny is irrelevant. I did what you told me to, Penelope. And I was fearless, numb. Besides, I need to ask Trudy about Neal. I wonder if she knows. If Manny wants to kill me, I guess he’ll just have to do it. I can’t take much more of this. I think Trudy hates me. I don’t know for sure. I saw you one last time tonight. You were in your window staring back at me. I blew you a kiss. Did you see it?  Why are you so far away? Good night Penelope. 
Seth

Susanne . Stay home. Be with your family. That’s all I’ll say. You are better than those people. I think you should stay clear of Trudy and her cousin. If you need to go to the police, then do it by yourself. You don’t need Trudy or that jerk to tell you what you know you need to do. 
Heather Ditto. : ) 
Jabberwocky9 You are a wise soul, Seth. I love this blog. Give the meds more time. I think you are confused right now. Just go with your heart. You have real friends. Take a look. They are here for you.  Happy Holidays!

CHRISTMAS MEMORY

January 3
Penelope—
My head has cleared somewhat. But I’m still heavy with something inexplicable. Neal Lourdes was released on bail. I guess it was a liberal judge. I read that he’s released on these conditions. First, the Lourdes had to post their home as surety on bail (in case he doesn’t show up for court or flees the country) and here are the other parts:
1.Neal will be on home electronic monitoring
2.Neal must stay home at all times and cannot attend school
3.Neal must have a parent or adult over the age of twenty-five must be with him at all times
4.Neal must not leave the state
It doesn’t sound so bad for a person like me. But I think for Neal, it will be hell. I don’t know why I should care. He probably did murder you. I feel saturated, confused. Penelope where are you? I didn’t see you yet today.  Emmet is somewhere out there. Or, maybe he’s dead. You would think either way he’d let me know.  Francis could be dodging bombs. Or, maybe he’s dead too. There is a void like some deep chasm in the spaces where energy flows. I am heavy with it. I had a vivid dream and I woke up thinking it was real. Then I realized it really did happen, and it was a memory from last Christmas:  
You come over to decorate the tree.  It's warm and misty. Francis is home. We are helping Dorrie and Seth bring the boxes up from storage. The basement is musty. I hate the basement. I am thinking about spiders crawling on me but don’t say anything. When I was younger, I would never go near the basement. Next, we decorate the tree. Penelope keeps elbowing Francis. They talk in soft tones. I can’t hear. You hold up a Baby’s First Christmas ornament—I love this one! It’s a photo of me framed inside a snowflake—This is you? She hits my arm. I knew it! I can tell because of those big round eyes!  Francis looks like Dorrie. I was told I look more like Emmet, my dad.  In the few photos I have, I can't see it. Although, I guess maybe we do have the same color hair and pointy chin. Sweet, you say, hanging my photo next to a green and silver striped glass ball. Where's yours, Francis? I am glad the attention is off me. 
 I begin to imagine Emmet in Paris and wonder if he has a tree, or if he’s alone or with friends or a family. “What's the temperature in Paris?” I’m invisible. No one responds.  I feel empty. I ask again. I keep asking. Dorrie finds Francis's Baby’s First Christmas, shows it to you, Penelope. You take it from her. Here he is! And then the lights and you shout—-Close your eyes Seth! You place your hands over my eyes; they are hot and smell like lavender. The tree lights up—a kaleidoscope of colors. The colors blend. The voices fade.  I can see the waves emitting specks of positive charge like Ed Leedskalnin’s beads of light shooting out, creating a larger current encircling us. Next, I see the positive charges flowing outwards and beyond the walls, our street, our town, carried by the heavy mist, creating a stream of goodness like a tributary cutting through the air, only to empty into the bigger river of waves. I feel safe. When I wake, I feel heavy and lost.
I looked up the temperature in Paris—44.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Why do I bother? Emmet Price is merely a figment of my imagination.

EMMET’S LETTER

January 5th
Penelope—
I passed on Christmas this year. I didn’t go to Trudy’s. I have presents sitting under the tree that I refuse to open. I stay in my room. I stare out my window. I wait for you, Penelope. I try to sleep so I can find you. I even take Benadryl and it knocks me out. Then every so often, I wake to Dorrie BEGGING me to come down. If she persists, I stomp my feet or slam my door. That usually works. She stays away. At one point, I heard your voice: write a letter, you told me.  Your voice was refreshing. Thank you, Pen. I thought I’d never hear it again. So, I did. I wrote a letter to Emmet Price. I don’t have his address, and I’m scared to ask Dorrie. Not really scared, but I don’t want her to know. I miss you so much, Penelope.  It is so strange that you are gone but still here in my head. I worry that you can read all my thoughts and I’m thinking about Trudy so much.  I know you helped me write the letter. We wrote it together. 
Dear Emmet:
Seeing that I am your son, Seth Price,  I thought I should write to you, ask how you're doing.  I know you are an artist but I haven't been able to find your paintings. I wonder if you use a different name.  I would love to see your paintings.  I remember a little about you but not much.  I have a couple photographs; in one of my favorites you are holding me next to the jetty at White Sands Beach. Our hair is the same color--light brown with blonde streaks-- and we are both tan. Dorrie has dark hair and fair skin like Francis. Dorrie says I look like you. I don’t know you well, but sometimes I feel you in the air (I know that sounds weird). But, I have some theories about electrically charged waves and how we are able to send signals, just like computers and radio waves; we can transmit our charges to each other. Do you know anything about Electromagnetic Waves?  If you do, we could talk about it.
I’m a freshman at Charles Pond High School (if you can believe that).  It’s been hard this year because 1. Francis left for Afghanistan in September and 2. My best friend Penelope Rutherford was murdered in October. But I see her and she talks to me. Maybe you read about the murder in the news, or on the computer?  Do you have a computer? I have a Mac Notebook, and I use it all the time. In fact, I have a blog www.ablogforPenelope. com, so if you can visit and leave a note that would be great. I don’t think I’ll be able to visit you in Paris any time soon.  But, if you wanted to pay for plane fare, I think I could convince Dorrie to let me go. If you want to mail me a letter, plane fare, or a card here’s my address:

Seth Price
22 Bretton Road
West Hartford, CT  06117. 

I hope you write back. I have so much to tell you. Besides, I am lonely lately. I could use a father.
Yours,
Seth

COMMENTS

Heather I like your letter so much. I think that your Dad will appreciate you writing to him. Don’t be afraid to ask your mother for the address. I think she will be okay with it. 
Anonymous Yes, mail the letter. Your dad would appreciate it. And even if you don’t hear back, at least you tried.
Susanne I’m in tears right now, Seth. I love your blog and your theories on waves are intriguing too!  I always thought you were SO smart. Penelope did too. She really loved you Seth. I mean that. She would always stick up for you when Neal said sh*t about you (I think he was jealous). He was so vicious to her. I just wish I had driven Penelope to the dance. I told her I wanted to go home to get dressed, and so she said she’d meet me there. She never made it. I should have waited for her!! Mail the letter.
@ Susanne—No, it was not your fault. Feel free to comment and follow my blog. Penelope loved you too.
@all—thanks…I will ask for the address tomorrow. 

TRUDY’S TOUCH AND RED WINE
February 1st
Penelope—
Updates are in order. I actually returned to school for half a day. Don Banks was getting on my nerves. Maybe it’s the medication working, but I feel lighter. My head is less clogged. Grades are slightly better. Teachers are working with me. We had the round table conference and the threat of retention was brought up. I said no way. Agreed to write my Of Mice and Men essay on the theme of…already forgot. I’ll think of it. I’m studying for math with a tutor in the library at school; his name is Brian and he’s a college student. He chews gum loudly and texts constantly. I walk with Trudy every day to school. After school, we sit on her porch, drink red wine.  And this helps too. We have become close friends. I keep thinking about Manny. She said he won’t really kick my butt, but I can’t be sure. So, I guess I’ll just stay quiet. I don’t want to go to jail for obstruction of justice. In fact, if anyone finds this blog, I’m in trouble. I don’t even want to talk about it anymore. Also, I need to confess (sorry Penelope) but I’m really enjoying Trudy. She makes me forget about you, or maybe it’s the wine I can’t tell. I keep waiting for her every morning. We walk to school and then walk home. I think our signals are definitely aligned. I don’t care if she is a lesbian. Oh, BTW, she told me the person she’s seeing is a girl. I think she could like me too. I think she does like me. She keeps touching me, and I let her. She even gave me a back massage. I felt my whole body go limp. It’s hard to believe she’s a lesbian. What’s it called when you like both boys and girls…is it bi-curious? I think that’s what she is.  I don’t care. I really like her, regardless.
COMMENTS
Heather It’s okay for Trudy and you to be friends. But be careful. If she is seeing someone else, you don’t want to cause a problem. Or get in the middle.
 2 cents Go for it!  Enjoy the moment. Sounds like the meds are working, dude.

TRAITORS
February 3rd
Penelope—
I couldn’t sleep last night. I had a horrible nightmare. I was trapped in a cell. It was sort of like jail but more like a cave. It was so dark and I could barely breathe. I woke up at 3 in the morning gasping for air, and I haven’t been able to sleep. I was hoping I’d see you, Penelope. I looked for you in your bedroom, by the shed. Where are you? I still need to see you. I walked with Trudy to school. She was quiet. She told me her Grandpa was sick. Here’s what she said:
 “It sucks. My Grandpa is really sick.”
 “Is he going to die?”
 “Jesus Christ. You really know what to say.”
 “I’m sorry.” I’d had enough of death, honestly, but I didn’t tell her that.
 “Shut up. Will ya?”
 “I mean it. I really am.” Then it was quiet for a while so I added “I think I may get in trouble for not telling.”
 “Not telling what?”
 “You know what.”
“No, I don’t.”
 “About you and Neal… remember?”
“What is wrong with you? No more talking.”  
I watched her pull out her Zippo lighter and light up. She blew the smoke out angrily. She didn’t make me feel better. I knew to shut up. At school Dorian was giving me dirty looks. He called me over after class, said I was not productive, and that I was slacking off again. I wanted to say go to hell. I really did. I’m sorry Penelope, I can’t study hard. Brian the tutor could care less and spends most of our time texting his girlfriend. I don’t have time for these things anymore. I am overloaded with negativity. Maybe it’s fear. I know I am a coward. I know I’m not like Francis. He would never be afraid of Manny or going to prison. I think he would tell. He’s wise that way. You are too.  I don’t feel wise. I never know what to do. 
Trudy didn’t walk home with me after school. I was standing at the window and I saw her walk by with Lacy. She has dark clothes and hair like Trudy except she’s really pale with platinum blonde hair. They were laughing and smoking, holding hands and grabbing each other. I felt unbridled rage. I wanted to scream, put my fist through the window, something. I hate to feel that way. So I tried to shift gears; I know I should study for math; write an essay on a theme from Of Mice and Men (I barely understood any of it). I guess I could write about how being me sucks. How you can’t trust anyone. Look at Lennie, that poor dope. He never saw it coming, that shot to the back of the head. How could he? I mean damn, it was from his protector, his best friend. Who will shoot me? Maybe it will come from Manny. You never expected Neal would murder you (if he even did which I now doubt). You tried to get away from him, but he didn’t let you. Who will get me? Maybe Trudy or her girlfriend, Lacy. Bring it on. I could die today. I’m not afraid of death because of you, Penelope. I know I can be with you and it’s safe.
pm
Where are you Penelope? I can’t see you anymore. I can’t trust anyone. Even these blog followers, honestly, I don’t REALLY know you either. Let’s face it. You are my virtual friends. How do I know you are who you are?  I don’t. I need some wine. I need anything. I’ll take vodka, beer, something. Dorrie and Ben are at a party. They have a life. I have none. That’s just the way it is. I have this blog. And I have some fake friends. I have no real father and a brother who never acknowledges me. Why would he? I’ve caused him too much pain. He always had to cover for me. I was such an ass, always messing up, throwing tantrums. No wonder my real dad left. I just screamed nonstop. I didn’t talk until I was five-years old. I was trapped inside myself. I couldn’t get out even if I wanted to. It was horror. So I screamed on the top of my lungs. I would have left too. What’s wrong with me? Why do I send everyone away? I’m sorry. This may be my last blog. I deserve whatever fate brings me. If I get arrested, that’s fine too. I live in a cell anyway. My own cell I’ve constructed. I can live in another cell too. It won’t make a difference. These meds aren’t working. I feel like I might want to take the whole bottle. Maybe after I drink the wine, I’ll have enough courage to do it. Then we can be together forever, Penelope. That’s what I want. That’s what I really want. I’m not afraid. I’m more afraid to be here all alone.
Seth

Heather  No, Seth. You don’t know me. I try to talk to you at school but you ignore me. But you can trust me. I swear. Please cheer up. I am your real friend. I promise. I need you. I pm’d you my phone number. PLEASE call me right now. I’m really worried about you.
2cents I’ll say it again, get some help dude.  You’re never alone. Trust yourself.
Jabberwock9  Bad day Seth. It will get better. I pm’d you my number so call me. Don’t do anything stupid. I like what 2cents said about trusting yourself. You have lots of time, lots to offer. Besides I like this blog so you better not quit.
Susanne OMG, Seth. Penelope would NOT want you to kill yourself. Please, call me right now. If you don’t call soon, within the next 15 minutes, I’m calling 911. 

THE KISS
February 10th
Penelope—
The ambulance came last night. I was mortified. Thanks a lot, Suz.  I told them I was fine and they believed me. I couldn’t find any booze. Good thing. They might have taken me if they smelled alcohol. I wasn’t wasted. And I don’t look like a depressed kid. So that was that. Plus, now I’m feeling better. Trudy and I kissed. We walked home together. She was excited about Neal, told me he talked to her and that they don’t have enough evidence to charge him. It felt like such a load was taken off my shoulders. “He sounds really good, confident.” I was quiet. I didn’t know what to say. I hope she’s right. But I didn’t care so much anymore. I just wanted her and her wine. We went to her house and she brought out wine and plastic cups. We sat on the porch step. She was singing lyrics from the Sex Pistols. I watched her mouth move. I kept thinking I wanted to kiss her. Then she stopped singing and looked at me as if she could read my mind. I felt the wine move down my throat, felt it warming me. She leaned over and kissed me on the lips. She kept her lips there for a few seconds. It was warmer than any wine. I felt a pit in my stomach. My head was light. I didn’t know what to make of it. I was getting aroused. I hate that word. I despise it because of health class. If it weren’t for health class, it wouldn’t be so bad a word. Then I kissed the sides of her mouth, and her neck, and I even put my tongue inside her mouth, and I started to move my hands over her body, and asked if this was okay. She started laughing. I don’t know why. It wasn’t funny. She just kept laughing. I was hoping she’d put her hands on certain parts, but she just kept laughing.  “What is so funny?”  I asked her. And she told me I was a goof. That was it. I told her I was going home. And she just said “Later.” 
 I never imagined a first kiss would be like that, end so abruptly. I’m sure it’s not love. I’m thinking I like the wine better than I like Trudy Markus. I won’t tell her that though. I mean the wine made me feel better than her kiss. And her breath smelled and tasted like smoke so it wasn’t so romantic. I don’t’ think this is the real thing. I hope there is more to it. I think if I had kissed you, Penelope, it would have been 300 times better. I know it.  I know you wouldn’t call me a goof either.
Seth

COMMENTS

2 cents LOL. Yep, it’s the wine that you want. 
Susanne I’m sorry about calling 911. But I would do it again. It doesn’t sound like Trudy is right for you. Be careful. I really do care about you, Seth. 
Heather sorry it wasn’t what you expected. I can help you. : )

A REAL KISS
February 11th
Penelope—
It was better. You made it all okay. It was so real. Maybe it wasn’t a dream. I can’t distinguish anymore. You rubbed my cheeks with the back of your hand. You pulled my head inwards, to your mouth. We kissed and it was long and amazing. You put your tongue inside my mouth and it was incredibly soft and warm and it tasted so good. I wanted to keep kissing, to feel every part of you. We were naked. I felt you against me, we were almost one, and I imagined Dorrie and Emmet in the photo, their bodies clamped together. That was us too. But then I woke up. I woke up to nothing. All I’m left with is Trudy. Maybe it will get better. I saw you in the morning. I was awake so I know it was real. You were standing at the front door. You looked up at me and waved. I blew you a kiss. I feel euphoric. I think you are teaching me how to kiss. Thank you. Maybe it will work better next time. 
Seth

Heather hmmmm. Careful, seth.
February 12th
Penelope—
Trudy didn’t go to school today. It’s been a day since we kissed. I feel so odd about it almost like I did something wrong. But really, she kissed me. I moved my hands over her back but never touched the other parts. I mean I asked first. Maybe I shouldn’t have asked? What do you think, Penelope? I’m waiting for the okay. I talked to Dorrie about Trudy. She said Trudy has lots of problems and I should be careful. So, I think I will take a break from Trudy. But I do still like her. I just feel so much intensity, so overwhelmed. I know you are with me, Penelope, but you are part of another world that I can’t always access.  Please help me. I need you one more time. I know you hear me when I write these words. I know it. No one could tell me otherwise.
Seth
COMMENTS
Heather I’ll admit it now if you haven’t guessed, Seth. I have the biggest crush on you! : ) If you want to kiss, I’m ready and waiting! I promise it won’t end abruptly either. I pm’d you a pic of me and my dog, Tip.
@heather  cute, thx
Anonymous love that name, Tip. 

POSITIVE CHARGES 

February 14th
Penelope—
I can only think of you today.  I am filled with positive charges. I was remembering your bike, the day your dad bought you that cool vintage bike at a tag sale for $25.00. He loved you so much. I can see why. He asked you “what color, Penny?” and you said teal so he painted it teal. He would do anything for you. I’ll admit. I was jealous. I wished I had a father like that. Your bike had a basket in the front. You always had a couple books in there. I loved how Emily Dickinson was your favorite poet and that you had her photograph taped inside your notebook. I thought her eyes looked like yours. I never told you that. One day Neal grabbed your book and started peeling off the picture. You yelled stop it and tried to get your book back.  That ass, he ignored you and kept doing it. Then he stopped when you became really angry: “Why do you like that old lady anyway? She looks like a prude,” he said to you. Then he threw the book down on the ground. It made a thud when it hit the ground. I wanted to scream. My internal thermometer was ready to burst. But I was quiet.  I think Neal couldn’t stand for you to like something more than him, even a dead poet. Neal was always mad. 
Penelope, I think you were drawn to the wrong source, misdirected to his energy because it was the exact opposite of yours. Opposites do attract when they are emitting at the same consistency. The opposition is no longer considered when the degree is equal. This scares me.
Edward Leedskalnin said that both positive and negative charges were of equal importance when it came to magnetic currents. Ed disputed contemporary science and stated that “All matter consists of magnets which can produce measurable phenomena and electricity.” Ed claimed to see “beads of light” and he explained how these were the physical presence of nature’s magnetism and life force otherwise known as Chi. 
I’m trying to remain positive. I’ve been avoiding Trudy. I got an A+ on my Steinbeck essay. McDermott wrote Beautiful essay, Seth. You are a gifted writer. I really think the blog has helped me. I’ve never been called gifted before by anyone! Dorrie writes poems and children’s books, so I guess it’s genetic. But I’ve never really taken a shine to writing until this blog. Maybe it’s the meds.
Seth
Comments
Heather Congrat’s on your essay!!! I’m not surprised in the least bit. Glad you liked my pic! Btw:  I once had a boyfriend who was a creep. He used to abuse me. One day my best friend told me she wouldn’t be my friend anymore if I kept this guy. So, I decided to dump him. I couldn’t see how bad he was until I was away from him!!!  
Susanne Seth, you made me cry. That memory was so vivid. I felt like Penelope was back. I loved her bike. Neal was so cruel to Penelope. I remember, too, when he would make fun of her poetry. He didn’t like me because I was a threat like you. I love your blog, but it is painful. Why haven’t you called me? Please don’t be angry about 911. I care about you!


GENETICS AND TRANSMISSION OF THOUGHTS

February 25th
Penelope—
am
I don’t know if it’s the medication, but I’ve been having real vivid memories lately. Here is my sledding memory:  
It’s February. We are sledding on the Rockledge Country Club hill. Francis is home and we ride down the hill together on your toboggan. Your legs and arms are wrapped around me. I am embarrassed because your boot is between my legs and pressing in that area and making me feel (ok one more time) aroused. The wind chill makes it ten below. We stay for two and one half hours. When we get home, my toes and fingers ache as they thaw. I pull my socks and put them up against the radiator. I notice they are bright red. It hurts so bad I want to cry. But instead I moan and Francis gives me that cut it out look. He makes hot chocolate on the stove. It’s your idea to put Marshmallow Fluff in our cocoa.  Francis seems quiet. You keep giggling and elbowing Francis, and he grins.  I think you like him the way I like you.  I don’t realize it until later on. Francis leaves for Afghanistan the next day. I cry all the time because I miss him so much. I don’t tell anyone how much. You don’t come around for at least three months. But at least you were alive.  
pm
A year later…it’s foggy with no snow. It is a white day, white like a canvas, so white I have to squint, and I can feel an odd sort of moisture in the air. Dorrie and I walked to the bookstore. We are here now. I’m blogging to you. It’s been a long time since we’ve done that, Dorrie and I going for a walk. I have to admit, it felt nice. It was peaceful. She didn’t ask me any questions. There were no expectations. When I passed St. Benedict’s Cemetery, I didn’t feel an urge to visit you or see you or feel you. I’m not sure why.  And I’m not sure if I like it. But maybe it’s significant. Up until this point, whenever I passed the cemetery, I felt compelled to go inside, stand by your marker, talk to you, wait for you to talk back, visit me. I don’t want to think your waves are dissipating. I can’t live without you, Penelope. I really can’t. But, right now, I feel a sense of peace at the bookstore. I like it because everyone is doing the same thing—reading, writing, or talking in hushed tones. We all have a single purpose in mind. Our waves are on level, balanced.  I feel connected. Our brains are emitting similar energy levels, but I don’t have to interact with anyone. It’s not that I dislike people; I just don’t want to be interrupted with small talk. 
Yet, I have to admit, I do feel different in a possibly good way, and even that worries me. I worry that you are fading and it makes me feel out of sorts. Also, Ben was supposed to meet us here, but he is still not here and an hour has gone by.  I know Ben has lots of deadlines and so sometimes he has to cover a story and can’t get away. Also, before we left for the bookstore, Dorrie asked me what I thought about Neal going to prison. If he did it, fine, I told her. Then she asked if I thought he did it. I was quiet. I looked over at her. Our eyes met. She thinks he’s guilty. I know she does. She didn’t have to say a word. I sensed it in the same way I can taste hot peppers. Dorrie and I are so connected that way. The closer you are, genetically, the more powerful the waves. This is what I mean by ingesting waves. You become part of the other. Energies intermix and thoughts words and feelings are transmitted via satellite via our brains.  Brain waves assimilate into the environment and mix with other satellite waves and become charged like a computer. Brains, then, have an IP address just like a computer. 
Ed Leedskanlin planetary grid hypothesis purported that the earth is covered by an invisible web of energy which is concentrated points of telluric powers. When these points converge they create unusual phenomenal. Ed claimed to have discovered the secret to creating anti-gravity. Neighbors reported Edward singing to his stones with his hands laid on them as if he were attempting to make them lighter. Others reported stones levitating above the coral structure like hydrogen balloons.  Edward was intuitive. He only completed 4th grade, but most of his knowledge came from reading and his sixth sense. So why are my senses so fickle? Why don’t I know for sure if Neal is innocent or guilty? Maybe it’s just easier to believe he is the one. There seems to be a firewall I can’t bypass. I made a list of reasons why he may or may not be guilty. 
1.DNA (but couldn’t there have been traces of it from when he was with you before 10/30?)
2.No alibi (possible alibi…)
3.Motive (you broke up with him a few times and Neal never murdered you—why this time?)

Heather yes, I am like that too but with my Dad. He knows what I’m going to say before I say it!  I hope I see you in school on Monday!

THE RAPIST

March 2nd
Penelope-
Benny boy is interesting. I’m sort of glad that he is around so much. Tonight, he came after dinner. We were eating apple pie a-la-mode, heated.  He told us some news, the topic de jeur (he referred to it)—Neal Lourdes. Neal has history of anger problems, Ben told us. I could have told him that. Police were called to the Lourdes home on several occasions. I have anger problems too (sometimes), but I have no intention of murdering anyone. Lots of people have anger issues, especially teenagers. We are more sensitive to energy waves and the increase in hormone levels. Contrary to what adults like to say about us, teenagers are not likely to injure or bully others, despite angry outbursts. Murder is rare. Sure, we may break a window or put a fist through a door, but murder? Not likely to happen. 
Second top story: I walked home with Trudy today. She said she needed me. I wasn’t sure why. She was distraught and breathless. I knew something was up. I couldn’t believe what she told me:
“You know there’s a criminal in our town. He almost got me but I ran away.”
 “What?” I was flabbergasted. We were drinking our cups of wine, sitting on a dry part of the porch swing. I was halfway through the cup when she told me. I wasn’t sure I was hearing her right.
“A rapist in West Hartford—you must have heard. A tall thin man like seven feet tall with a really deep voice attacked a jogger last week. He pulled her into the bushes and raped her.  Well, he's still on the loose. And I was walking home from the center at about 11 p.m., and this guy that fits that description grabbed me.” 
 “Did he rape you?”
“NO! I said I got away. I punched him in the crotch and ran. But it scared the shit out of me. I ran so fast I couldn’t breathe. He chased me too.”
“How far did he chase you?”
 “I think pretty far. At least to the top of my street…and the worst part is he has my backpack.”
 “At least he didn’t rape you or kill you.” I couldn’t help but think about you, Penelope, how you weren’t so lucky.
“No, but he has my ID with my address. I basically live alone here. I mean Grandpa is always passed out. Seth, I’m really scared. I don’t know what I should do.”
 “Trudy. I think you should go to the police. You need to report it.” 
I was thinking maybe she’d report the other too. I felt mature. It was a weird feeling. I just stared at her and felt like I could do something for her. She was scared. Trudy Markus was actually afraid. And she was crying. I put my arm around her to comfort her and then she really let it out. Her whole body was shaking. I’m not really good with these matters, so I just kept patting her back the way I remember Dorrie did it to me when I was small. She just kept crying like a baby saying I’m so scared. I’m so scared. I told her it would be okay and I would go with her to the police. Her back was heaving and she felt so hot, so human. Then I thought about Manny. I asked her if he would come around to stay with her for a bit. That’s when she admitted he was back in prison for drugs for at least ten years. I was euphoric. 
I felt free, finally. I felt like I could do the right thing now and not feel like a criminal. I knew that Trudy would confess about Neal now that she was so vulnerable. It’s the way things work. I refilled our cups. I told her to drink some more so that she would feel better. She wiped her eyes. There were black smudges all over her face. I started laughing this time. I couldn’t help it. She looked like a raccoon. Then when I told her she ran inside. A few minutes later, she came out of the house hunched over, laughing so hard she said she pee’d her pants. We finished our wine. It was quiet. But it wasn’t awkward. Then I don’t even know how it happened but she said she wanted to kiss me. 
We kissed and it was a long and sensual. Our mouths were pressed so hard. It felt like I was inside another person I can’t describe it. I tasted her cherry cigarettes and wine and saliva. It didn’t taste as good as you Penelope. But still my heart raced so hard I thought it would come out of my chest. I thought for sure I would have a heart attack.  This time I wanted Trudy. I wanted her more than the wine. Not to be gross, but I wanted crush my body into hers so that we were like one whole piece. I felt like I might burst. I think you were with me, Penelope. I felt you. And right when we were both so heavy into it, she stopped kissing me. And said she had to go inside. “I really like you, Seth Price.  I really do.” she said to me. I was breathless, still gasping for air. I sat there for a few minutes, waiting. Then, when she didn’t return, I went home. 
I took a shower and then just at on the edge of my bed. I didn’t look for you, Penelope. I don’t know why. I took a few Benadryl, hoping to pass out. I did.
Seth

2cents man sorry to hear 
Susanne I’m glad she stopped. Sounds like she respects you, Seth and that maybe she’s turning over a new leaf…scary about that rapist! I wonder if he is a suspect in Pen’s murder.
Heather I’m glad too : )

THE FACADE

March 3rd
Penelope—
Ben said they caught the rapist last night. He wasn’t your murderer. Women joggers gathered at the same route and time and jogged this morning in support of the victim and to celebrate his capture.  Ben said the woman was attacked right in someone’s yard. He jumped out of the bushes and grabbed her from behind.  She never expected it. It made me think, did you know your assaulter, Penelope? Was it Neal? Were you tricked, lured into Neal’s truck before you were strangled? You were sexually assaulted too. You were killed because maybe you fought to get away. Maybe you were thinking about escaping, if you could just get out of that truck. But your assaulter was too strong and the more you struggled the tighter he pressed his weight on you. He choked you to death.  You died of asphyxiation. You would never wear your hippie costume. You missed the dance, and you would never dance again or eat candy corn and black jelly beans. You missed Thomas and Julia making out on the dance floor. You missed Dorian dressed in his Count Dracula costume flirting with McDermott who came as Joan De Arc.  You missed the haunted School yard tour led by Rell who was disguised as the Grim Reaper and wore a black cloak and spoke in low tones, describing staged scenes like the tricycle tipped on its side, one wheel spinning, a piece of dress smeared with blood—Poor Melissa never made it home—Rell’s eerie tone narrated while McDermott’s voice (disguised as mother) bellowed in the distance—Melissa! Where are you, Melissa?! You were Melissa, abducted, murdered, except it was real and the bike wasn’t a tricycle but a teal painted vintage bike with a basket tipped on its side and one wheel still spinning and your body a few feet away muddied and broken.  
How could I not have felt it?  The waves never reached me because I never suspected. I laughed and danced. I had fun at our school party.  I decided you were with Neal. That was that.  In fact, I wasn't even mad that you chose Neal.  I pretended I had lots of friends and somewhere I imagined you were wishing you had come to the party, and this made me feel even more confident sporting my 1920's gangster costume with my hair slicked back under a fedora hat and oxford shoes. I couldn’t wear the mustache because it itched too much. I’m sorry, Penelope.

Jabberwocky9 When my friend committed suicide, I felt as if I could have done something to save him. I kept reliving it until I couldn’t breathe or eat or sleep anymore. You need to forgive yourself for having fun at the party. You didn’t murder Penelope.

@all—thanks.

THE MURDER

March 4th
Penelope—
am
I think this blog is making my brain hurt. I have a massive brain glitch. I didn’t sleep last night. I think I want to forget. But, I can’t. I feel like I’m digging deeper into the memories, to get as close as I can to the core, the mother board, in order to understand it. I think Trudy is a distraction but I can’t rely on her. Trudy is not you, Penelope. I torture myself on a daily basis. My brain keeps replaying how it could have happened if Neal wasn’t with Trudy and he did murder you:   
I imagine you are riding your bike…thinking about the Halloween party, your costume, the fun, the music, the candy. And then he comes along— Neal pulls up alongside you; maybe you recognize the sound of his truck so you turn around. He sticks his head out the window, calm, inviting “Come on, Pen, I just want to talk.” You say no, initially, and keep pedaling because you want to get to the Halloween party and maybe you have a sense something is off. But Neal is relentless. He follows, slowly, pleading. You agree, reluctantly. He puts your bike in the back, throws it in the bed of the truck too hard. You sense something, turn to look, feel your heart beating faster. Then when you are absolutely sure, Neal starts to accelerate. You tell him to slow down. He goes faster, turns in the wrong direction, away from North Main Street and Charles Pond High, and down Fern Road, heading towards Elizabeth Park, the last place you would see. And then maybe you ask him where he’s going, and he locks the doors, goes even faster, further away from the center, away from safety.  You panic, but try hard not to show it. You pretend everything is fine to keep him calm. The roar of his truck is deafening. He turns into Elizabeth Park, driving slowly down the meandering one-lane road to a secluded spot crowded with the pines and brush (the same spot Mrs. Green would find your body, lifeless, the next morning). Tonight, because we pushed the clocks back the night before, the sun would have set by 6:00 p.m., and it would be isolated—no walkers or joggers or picnickers.  You are desperate but still in denial. You want to believe it’s all good and normal, and that you’ll get out of his truck, yell at him, slam the door, get away from him, finally, walk home even if you have to or hitch a ride.  
This time never happens.  He reaches over to kiss you. You push him away because now you know nothing is normal and it will never be okay. Now you know for sure he will never let you go. You start to thrash and fight and scream. At that point, he holds your mouth to quiet you. You gasp for air. He presses down on you, yanks your pants down and his own. Maybe he never even meant to kill you, initially, but he had to have you one last time and his anger blew out like some beast, beyond his control. I’ve read that victims become calm when being raped for a few reasons:  
1)Defeat 
2)Fear
3)Shock
4)Inebriated (you didn’t drink)
5)
Once he’s done, he realizes that you are too quiet, too still. He pulls his pants up, pulls yours up too as if it will change what’s happened.  He panics, turns the inside light on, and notices the way your lips are parted, how your eyes stare upward. He tries to shake you and then swears, pounds the dashboard with his fist. 
Why do I torture myself? I need Trudy, wine, something. Help me, Penelope.
pm
It’s hard to concentrate at school because I’m sleep deprived.
So, during last period, history, when Daglio was sketching out the end of the year project, I sketched out a sociopath’s (possibly Neal’s) profile:
1.Neal never takes accountability for anything
2.Neal would get mad at you for dying
3.It’s easier when he’s mad to drag your body out of the truck and dump you in the brook 

Is it you, Penelope? Are you telling me Neal did it? Is it you that’s sending me these images? I should go the police and tell them about Trudy and Neal. What if he didn’t do it? Lately, I can’t stop thinking of you, dead; your body discarded like garbage in the brook, next to the wooden bridge we crossed so many times when you were alive; the bridge that led to the gazebo and the pond with the ducks. You always had bread for the ducks. And after the truck pulls away, and the hum of the motor is faint, there is you—alone and still in the dark, and air is silent; and the last breath is moving out of your lungs; you would never inhale, or see or touch or smell the fuchsia roses. I can’t get these thoughts out of my head. They just keep replaying. You had on your favorite jeans with a peace sign sewed on the pocket and her forest green hoodie with Charles Pond and Chieftains on the front. I have to think of it now while you’re fading, or I’ll forget you. Hate sends volatile waves into the air like a ferocious beast, like a poisonous gush of negative charges. I hate Neal. I hate whoever did that to you. So much hate scares me.  I have no doubt, today, that Neal is the murderer. I have to channel this anger, let it fall and settle on someone like silt, let it rest there for a while until it dissolves or gets blown away. But tomorrow, who knows. Where are you? I need you.

ABANDONMENT
March 10th
Penelope—
 I read how Neal’s parents were gamblers. They left him asleep in his car seat in front of a casino and he woke up six hours later crying and dehydrated. His parents were arrested for child abuse and Neal was taken out of his house and placed into foster care.  He was one of the lucky ones. I asked Ben what he meant by lucky. He explained that many kids need therapeutic care but instead are placed in long stay hospital settings. The Lourdes adopted him early on and took great care of him. But still, Penelope, there is his past, his origins. He came from a negative source and some of that was ingested.  Benny boy was somber when he spoke. He’s like that. I really like Ben, don’t get me wrong, but he’s a bit too emotional at times. It wasn’t like he was a foster kid himself. I don’t know how he understands it all so well. Or why he cares.  
I still can’t eat much lately. I’m sure I’m dropping weight. My pants are hanging off me. These thoughts consume me, strong currents like a tsunami in my psyche. My brain is in the middle of a reboot that never finishes. Trudy keeps pestering me to walk home with her. I can’t do it. I don’t know why. Where are you Penelope? I haven’t seen you lately. I keep looking but you’re not there.  Don’t abandon me. If it’s the meds making you disappear, I swear I’ll stop taking them. I swear I will.
Seth
COMMENTS

Jabberwocky9 Yes, that abandonment is hard to deal with no matter how much love and then there’s genetics too. So maybe it’s not entirely Neal’s fault, but he still has to pay the piper.
Heather thanks for the email. I hope I helped!
@heather you did.

THE TRUTH 

March 20th
Penelope—
Penelope I need you so badly I could scream. I stood at my window for most of the morning looking for you. I don’t hear you. I can’t see you. Please help me. The meds could be doing more than I want. I need you now. I just found out something big, really big.  I need you! It’s about the Emmet Price. I always thought Emmett Price was a great name, remember? And I wanted to believe so badly that my father was some famous artist. Ridiculous, I know. You tried to tell me. I remember when you insisted that I get over it and that Emmet Price could be a homeless guy on the street. All along, I suspected the static, the weak line, but I didn’t want to admit it. Now I know the idea of my father is, like you said, one big lie and that life is random and dark waves are closer than I ever imagined. 
It all started at breakfast this morning:  Dorrie was standing by the sink in an odd way with the newspaper in her hand, staring at me, looking way too serious. She said she wanted to talk to me. She handed me the paper. Here’s what I read:
Faith tested by Lutheran church members. “One of our own…Member burns down Emmanuel Lutheran church. When asked why he did it he said, ‘It seemed to be more practical.’” The church was undergoing renovations and had just announced plans to acquire a new alter.  The arson was an artist with psychological problems, Bipolar, but still well liked and a member of the church. “He’d come every weekend and collect the tithe, or help out with the food drive or clothes collection.” Parishioners described him as “erratic, but ‘pleasant when he was on his meds.”” I read it but didn’t get it. I told her I didn’t get it. None of it was making sense. Why should I care?  Then I read “But Emmet Price didn’t always want to take his meds,” his friend reported,”… because he couldn’t paint when he took his meds.”  Emmet Price was the name of the crazy man who burned down a church, who was prone to rages and outbursts and was arrested for assault and battery. 
Even though I read it, I didn’t want to believe it. I threw the paper down. I ran from the room, thumped up the stairs, and slammed my bedroom door so hard the frame cracked. NO way was I going to school. NO way was I ever moving. When I did finally move, an hour or so later, I found her at the kitchen table with a cup of tea. The room smelled like cinnamon apple. She stirred the cup with the spoon, moved the teabag in and out. My father was in a hospital in New Haven pending a psychiatric evaluation and all she could do was let her tea steep.  Dorrie confessed it all to me—where he’d lived for the past twenty years when he returned from Europe, how he was an artist but mentally ill and how he refused to take his medication.  She told me that she lost contact with him years ago. She tried to stay with him, said she loved him but he was too erratic.  
“I thought he was an artist in Paris? What about that? How could you lie to your own son?”  I was mad, madder than I’ve ever been at Dorrie. 
“It made you happy,” she said. “And when I tried to tell you the truth, you would scream. You didn’t want to know the truth.” 
Her voice was shaky.  I suddenly felt bad for her. She was so nervous she was shaking. I’d never seen her like that. She never once took a sip of her tea. Not once. I thought of her in the photograph clinging to a person she couldn’t keep, smiling happily.  I left her there, Penelope. I know you would have wanted me to stay, hug her, tell her it was okay, and forgive her. But I couldn’t. My brain waves are discombobulated. I need to talk to Landau. I told Dorrie. She made the appointment. I’m not sure what is what anymore. I don’t eat. I can barely sleep. I’ve always believed in the name Emmet Price.  Now, it is sinister. I am consumed by sinister. It is all around me. The one person I always believed was Dorrie. Now, my ground is crumbling. She lied to me and nothing seems real anymore. I think these meds aren’t working right.
p.m.
So, I had an appointment with Landau, and I was all ready to confess how the meds aren’t working, how I see you Penelope and how you talk to me, and how my life stinks, how I am a possible danger to society, how I don’t want to be locked up or be like my dad, the mad artist who burns down churches. I didn’t say any of this. Instead, I listened as Landau talked about his new grandson, Jeffrey. He had a whole roll of digital picture on his camera. I pretended to be interested. I decided with all the positive baby waves, my bad waves weren’t so important. After I looked at the pictures and used up all my standard responses like—He looks like you—and—cute—Landau suddenly shifted gears, asked me how I was feeling.  I told him school was getting easier, and that I was feeling much more positive about everything. Then he stared at me. It was awkward. I think he sensed I was holding back. So I decided to ask him about being manic. I asked if it was genetic. He said it could be. He explained it as a high level of energy that gets out of control. I asked if you could hallucinate too. He said yes and then asked if I have been hallucinating. I said maybe. “Do you want to tell me about it?” he asked.  I said no again.  I decided I was okay with being manic. I was still young. I could paint. Maybe it was my legacy. “I hope I’m manic one day” I blurted out. Landau looked at me differently. I wanted to look at the pictures for a distraction, but the camera was put away.  He wasn’t even writing. He just sat there, glaring at me. His eyes were like two hot irons searing. I realized I said too much.  I felt a pain in my forehead. I wasn’t sure what to say, so I folded my arms. Then I started talking about Trudy. I went on and on about how we kissed and how I wanted more of a relationship but that she seemed aloof and not interested. I told him I sometimes get stuck on seeing her and how we drank wine. He explained that I shouldn’t drink while on my medication. He asked if I had been taking my medication. Then he wrote out another prescription, told me to give it to my mom.

Jabberwocky9 Madness is underrated. I think all great thinkers are mad. They just go together like hotdogs and mustard.  I’m mad too. Don’t worry.

EMMET’S PAINTING


March 28th
Penelope—
So I started a new med. I take two every morning now. I’m an official lunatic. I don’t know if I trust this doctor. I feel  dizzy I can barely move my head. Don Banks has returned. I didn’t even know he was coming! He just showed up this morning at my bedroom door. Talk about invasive. Don’t I have any rights? I guess the mentally ill are second class citizens. I might as well get used to it. When I asked Dorrie she explained that I wasn’t going to school enough so the school recommended a tutor. She said she told me. I don’t remember. I think the meds are destroying my short term memory. I listened to Don Banks drone on about Viet Nam, how his buddy saved his life. Just when he was explaining the good parts, Dorrie interrupted, said that Trudy was at the door.  As much as I craved her body and her wine, I told Dorrie and Seth not to let her in. I decided I had my own trauma. If I get arrested for obstruction of justice, so be it. It’s my fate. As a matter of fact, after Banks left, I started thinking some more about Emmet, his paintings. I always thought I had to go to Paris, to an outdoor café with an art gallery, to see his paintings. You were going to go with me, Pen, remember? But Dorrie said that his paintings are in Middletown, 35 miles away. She said we can go this Saturday. I told her that we should go Friday instead. I don’t know why I said Friday. I don’t know why she wants to see his paintings now. I think our wires are crossed. Go, you said. I heard you. I felt a sense of relief that you returned. But then part of me felt uneasy. Maybe it’s the meds. Go keeps repeating in my head like a bad brain glitch. I think it’s you but I can’t be sure. Now, I think it could be my conscience. I will go to Middletown. I trust you, Penelope. I have to trust you. I have no one else.

GOOD FRIDAY AND THE BEANTREE CAFÉ AND BY THE JETTY

April 2nd
Penelope—
Christians believe no one dies alone because the Lord is always present. It’s Good Friday. It is the day that Jesus was nailed to a cross and died of asphyxiation. His body was stretched out and it compressed his lungs and that’s how he died. His last words were these: “My God, my God why hast thou forsaken me?” Penelope you died in the same way. I saw you this morning. I saw you standing at the shed. I think you wanted me to know you are still with me. Your image was blurry. But I could tell it was you. What do you want from me? I wish you could talk. I can barely hear your voice anymore. Sometimes I try hard to recall it. When I can’t, I feel utter panic. I don’t understand how Dorrie could have lied to me. I am trying to make sense of it all. One part wants to forgive her and the other part wants to reject her. My waves are static.  
Today helped clear the waves:  Dorrie took me to The Bean Tree a small café- book store in Middletown where Emmet Price’s paintings are displayed and for sale. The ride was quiet. When we walked in, I smelled church—incense and candles. I saw shelves and shelves of books in narrow rows. A woman in a long hippie type skirt, sandals and two pony tails on the side of her head said hello. She looked younger from a distance. When she got up close, I saw her wrinkles.
 “Hello” she said “My name is Lola. Is there anything special you’re looking for today?”  
  “No, I want to see the art,” I told her. I got right to the point. There was only one painting left out of the three, and it was titled by the jetty. It was salmon colored blended with pastels, with the jetty, sunfish sailboats, orange row boats in the foreground and a row of wood shingled cottages in the background. Of all the places Emmet’s seen, I thought of how it could have been the Eiffel Tower or the Seine River or medieval castles or churches.  No, it was Long Island Sound and some damn rocks and shi**y cottages. Dorrie asked how much. “I’m sorry. It’s not for sale,” the hippy lady Lola said, even though it was displayed with other paintings that were for sale. She looked worried, sick. She said this was a special one, the last, and she’d had it for a while. It was given to her as a gift. I couldn’t help myself then, and I yelled at her, told her the artist was my father, Emmet Price, and that was our painting. I told her she couldn’t have it. I even tried to take it off the wall and I would have but Dorrie grabbed my arm (pretty hard) and coaxed me out of the store. She said I embarrassed her, and that I needed to take a deep breath. But Lola was so impressed, she gave me the painting. She told me Emmet was a brilliant painter and that I should be proud.  She was teary eyed. I asked her if she knew that he burned down churches. She said that she had read that in the paper, and that she was sorry but that he was still a brilliant painter even if he did burn down the church.
 On the ride home, the car was silent. We were both on standby. I held the painting, ran my hands along the bottom right hand corner, Emmet Price’s signature, the closest I’d come to a connection. I knew he felt me, then. I sent my waves. Thank you, Penelope. You were right again. I’m glad I went. I love my painting.

EASTER EVENTS

April 4th
Penelope—
I collapsed last night. I think I need to stop the Benadryl. I’m sure they aren’t good for me. I woke up, went downstairs, found my basket (Dorrie insists) and gorged myself with chocolate eggs and jelly beans. Today is Easter Sunday, the day Jesus rose from the dead and my head is aching. We are Catholics like you Penelope but we don’t always follow the rules. I used to be jealous of you, the way your family piled into the car every Sunday. We stopped going when I was little. I’m not sure why. It was about the time that Emmet Price left. I was only four-years old. But this morning, we went to church—all three of us. I agreed to go because I thought I could say a prayer, get closer to you. 
It was crowded in the church because people (sinners) who don’t normally go to church decide, like us, to go on Easter Sunday. I was smashed between Ben and some elderly man with a bad cough and wheezing. It wasn’t the most holy experience. We had nosebleed seats, so I couldn’t even see the priest or the Alter which means I could barely hear the Mass. I like to hear what’s going on. But, at one point, I looked up at the stained glass windows inside St. Thomas and the sun streamed through and a hymn was being sung and when we bowed our heads in prayer, I spoke to you Penelope and Emmet and prayed for forgiveness and peace and all that good stuff.  I felt a rush. My body was shaking. I even went up for the Eucharist. I figured I was cleared of all mortal sins and I had confessed as much as I could on my blog and in my head.  
After, we had Chinese for dinner (I ordered fried dumplings) and then we played cards. It was, overall, a productive day. Dorrie said we should go to church every Sunday. “We won’t” I told her. Then I heard the sirens. 
I looked out the living room bay window and saw an ambulance and police cars at the Markus’s house. I ran outside, barefoot, imagining the worst.  I couldn’t help myself. I was a maniac from all the chocolate eggs I’d eaten. I felt like an actor in a movie. When I reached her house, I saw the grandfather on the ground by his chair, paramedics working on him. Trudy was standing with Neal Lourdes off to the side, holding a half emptied bottle of wine moaning “Grandpa please…please don’t die…please don’t leave me.” And Neal Lourdes the alleged cold-blooded murderer, sporting an electric monitoring device on his ankle, was rubbing her back, saying “It will be okay, Trudes. I promise. It’s okay. It’s okay. I’m here. I’m here. I’m not going anywhere. I promise.”  What a scene. It was dramatic for sure. 
He called her Trudes. I thought of that later. I decided Trudy was telling the truth and Neal was really with her the night Penelope died. I mean really WITH her. Penelope it’s all becoming clearer. He would never have called her Trudes unless they had a thing and, also, he was taking a huge risk being at her house so he must be either stupid or in love or both.

FORGIVENESS AND THE DEATH OF EMILIO THOMAS MARKUS

April 5th
Penelope—
I read more about my father, Emmet Price. Parishioners of Emmanuel church forgive their friend and parishioner Emmet Price for burning down their church:  “Love your neighbor” said Thomas Bowden. “Emmet was a dear friend, after all, and sick” said another.  I read it and then asked Dorrie for Emmet’s address.  I added this to my letter:  I’m sorry you are sick.  I hope you feel better soon and gave the letter to Dorrie, asked her if she could please proof it, and then she said she was sorry and that she loved me and thought I was brave.  I looked at her and almost said okay. But I didn’t.  I’m still mad. Part of me is still mad. 
BTW: Trudy Markus’s grandfather, Emilio Thomas Markus passed away on Easter Sunday at 11:59 P.M.  Neal Lourdes’s truck has been parked at the Markus’s home since yesterday. I can’t say I’m jealous. But I am curious. I wonder what they are doing in there, if they have talked about going to the police.

A LETTER TO FRANCIS

April 7th
Penelope—
Today was not productive. I woke up dizzy. I think the meds are making me ill—better, but ill at the same time. I never see you much anymore. When I do, you fade in and out. It disturbs me.  All day, I obsessed over visiting my dad. I asked Dorrie. She said no, not now—maybe soon. I asked her when I would become officially manic, what age. I wonder about these things. Dorrie said never, and I shouldn’t worry about it. I’m not really worried, I assured her. I lied because I’m sick of being a wimp.  I want to be more like Francis, any brave soldier for that matter.  I wrote him a letter:
Dear Francis:
I wonder when you will be coming home.  How is the weather in Afghanistan? Remember at White Sands Beach we would race on the jetty and I slipped and cut open my leg. You carried me back to the cottage. You were like a soldier even back then. I am trying to be brave like you. But when I think about being in a war, with guns and bombs, it only makes me afraid. At night, I hear a jet and think it’s going to crash into our house.  I don’t like to be alone. I am always afraid. I will never be a soldier like you, Francis. I hear they have spiders as tall as 3 feet. Is this true? I don’t think I could stand to see one of those. Never mind the sounds of bombs, the spiders are scary enough. BTW: I still miss Penelope but I’ve met someone else.  Neal Lourdes is still under house arrest. His lawyer keeps getting a delay (not sure how). I wonder if you could tell me about criminals. I have this theory that we are all guilty and that maybe Neal (Penelope’s murderer) was an addict. He couldn’t lose Penelope because she was his addiction. What will happen to him? I thought you might know more about these things. Dad is a criminal. Did you know that he burned down a church? But his friends forgave him so they might not press charges. I wrote Dad a letter and mailed it. Good Friday, I got one of his paintings. When you come home you can see it. Did you know Jesus forgave his enemies? I’ve been thinking of that, lately. Okay, See you soon (hopefully).
Love your brother, Seth

Jabberwocky9 OMG—great letter Seth. You’re a neat kid. Don’t forget it.
Susanne I think you are very brave, too Seth. Penelope thought so too. I love the letter and hope you stop worrying soon. Life is hard right now, but I’m sure it will get better. Yes, I agree that Neal must have a good lawyer. But come on. Why is it taking so long?
@all-- once, again, thx I don’t have much else to say. But I appreciate your responses.
@heather thanks for the poem and the chat.
Heather pleasure was all mine!!!! 

BECOMING 

April 28th
 Penelope—
I am not necessarily brave. But someone is making me feel braver, I have to admit and I’m enjoying every minute of it (wink). I never realized.  
Less than two months before summer vacation. Trudy Markus is gone. Her house is dark and closed up. I think she must be living with Neal Lourdes. I think she dropped out of school too. Every morning, I walk to school, but I don’t see her. I don’t think I’ll ever be with Trudy again…that way.  But I just hope they go to the police. Neal’s trial is coming up soon. 
Seth said we can rent our old cottage at White Sands Beach. “He knows how much it means to you” Dorrie told me. She called it a nice gesture.  All that means is that I need to be gracious even if I’m not that excited. I am sort of okay with it; but it won’t be the same as when we used to go with my cousins and Francis was home, and you would come down for a stay. I think I’m evolving, entering a new phase, and I really don’t want to go back to the past, when you were alive, Pen, and Francis was home and I believed Dad was in Europe painting the Eiffel Tower not living in a subsidized apartment in New Haven, plotting to burn down the Lutheran church. Part of me wants to bury it, bury the past; I feel myself becoming.

ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE THEORIES

May 1st
 Penelope--
You would be proud. I read today. I think my head is finally clearing. I read that the President is going to reduce the proliferation of nuclear arms I decided to ask Francis what he thinks about that. I also read how Edward Leedskalnin moved his entire quarry of stones 10 miles, to Homestead. No one knows how he did it or why. There was speculation that he got spooked when he heard about a possible subdivision being built around his castle. Another theory was that he made a mathematical error and needed to align the structure in proportion to the North and South Pole convergence in order to produce a harmonic state and possible manipulation of anti-gravity. 
Then, I read about a guy named Dr. Professor McFadden of the Surrey University in the UK. Dr. McFadden has a theory on electromagnetic waves and our brains. McFadden says our thoughts are made up of an electromagnetic field that can permeate space and carry the broadcast signal to the TV or radio.  The brain, according to McFadden, has an electromagnetic (em) field so that when we stare at an image, the em field binds the image into a whole. He uses an example of a tree:  if we stare at the tree and see the thousands of leaves on it, we don’t see the billions of scattered neurons. Instead, we see it in one whole image bound together. Professor McFadden suggests that each time we view an object, a nerve fires, and that electrical activity sends a signal to the brain's em field. The information that reaches the brain's em field is automatically bound together with all the other signals in the brain. The brain's em field does the binding and that is what we know as consciousness.  I know you would be interested, Penelope. At least, you would pretend to be.

Susanne SO glad to hear, Seth!
Heather omg. That Ed Leedskalnin is so small and cute. I went to coral museum website. Check out his piercing gaze!  I think he was an alien. McFadden is confusing. I’ll need to read more about it. Can you forward a link? Are we still meeting tomorrow?
@heather yes and yes

SECOND LETTER TO FRANCIS
May 4th
Penelope—
I haven’t seen you lately. I don’t hear you much anymore either. I can’t say that’s a good thing, but it makes me feel okay and weird at the same time. I’ve been seeing someone else and she is changing me for the better. I feel it (wink wink). Today was a semi-normal day, a 50 percent okay day. Heather is helping. Writing is helping. I wrote Francis another letter. 
Dear Francis:
Could you tell me about the reduction of nuclear arms? Do you think it will cause a hyper-proliferation or not? I’m concerned.  I know you are the expert in weaponry so I thought you might know something about it. Please write back soon. I worry that we are making a mistake and that are too relaxed about it all. According to a few editorials, countries can attack us with biological and chemical weapons and the US can no longer threaten to retaliate with nuclear weapons. I do agree with Obama that we should be working towards a more peaceful world, but I don’t think it’s so easy. What if teachers relied on nice words to keep the class in line? Forget it. The annoying kids would never stop and it would be chaotic. I suspect some would even burn down the school if they had the chance. You must know soldiers that with no sense or moral conscience that would be shooting fellow soldiers for the heck of it if they weren’t kept in line, threatened with a dishonorable discharge. Francis. Let me know what you think about the issue; the sooner the better!!! Also, how long does it take for a murder trial?
Love your brother Seth

Anonymous You are right to be worried. We need to get a handle on those arms or we are all doomed.  No amount of waves, no matter how positively charged, will save us from the mushroom cloud.

THE NIGHTMARE

May 5th

Penelope—
Last night I dreamt we were bombed. You and I were playing Crazy Eights and then we heard a loud bang. You said it was just a dump truck or blown transformer. But when I looked outside I saw fireballs and flames coming down from the sky. I screamed for you to move, but you wouldn’t get off the couch. You said I was ridiculous. Neal was behind you, then, and he looked as if he were smiling. The air was orange and reddish. I wanted to run because I didn’t want to be burned alive. If you go outside you will get blown to pieces, Neal said to me. And then I woke up.  I don’t ever want to sleep again. 
COMMENTS
Heather OMG so scary! Sorry to hear. : (  I wish I could hug you right now!
@heather that would be nice. Meet me after school.



THE WORRIES
May 7th
Penelope—
Strange, how the air gets clogged. I never studied for Dorian’s math test. Don Banks wouldn’t shut up about Viet Nam, his buddy getting his leg blown off “Flew right up into the air about ten feet” he told me. He was so into it, I couldn’t interrupt. I read some articles and wrote my blog and thought about my problems. That’s the thing with worrying. You can worry about the worry and then it becomes a constant and your energies are drained into this one negative power. As far as I’m concerned, the negative waves are more important than any math test. The world could be under attack and the best mathematician like Einstein or Copernicus could never save us. It would be catastrophic. 
Neal Lourdes’s alibi fell through. He could have murdered you, Penelope. I still don’t know if he did or not. Only you know the truth. What is it, Penelope? What is the truth? Why are you so far away? Please visit me. Even though I’m improving, I miss you. I know you can hear me. I know you are watching.
Seth

2cents time to lose that Banks dude, huh? I bet you parents are paying a fortune to have him sit at your house and recount horror stories from Viet Nam.

MAY MEMORY

May 10th
Penelope—
…another vivid memory…you are humming, riding your bike. I like that. I’m riding behind you. It’s early May, and we are riding to the center. It’s approximately 1.5 miles. It is a clear sunny day and warm for May. All the leaves on the oaks are rich colored like I could eat them. I feel as if I’m in the middle of a poem. I don’t understand most poems, but I like the way some of them feel in the same way I like a song without knowing the lyrics. When we get to Gerry’s Parlor, I don’t even care about the ice cream. It’s the process I like— the pedaling, the parking our bikes outside, the kickstand, the opening of the door, the blast of cool air and ice cream smells. It is so much more than I can write about. Only a great poet like W. B. Yeats could describe it in words.  Only a great artist like Emmet Price could paint it.  I am not great at all. I am Seth, the mediocre, the great thinker who has theories about the waves we emit into the air. I have no proof, only instincts. I will never be a great artist. You order your favorite chocolate chip mint on a sugar cone. I order my favorite combo of of chocolate and coffee in a cup. I am short a dime and then you find one on the floor and we laugh. 
Seth
COMMENTS

Jabberwocky9., it’s best to stay positive. Otherwise, you add to the negative flow. It must be so hard to think about Penelope being gone, but I do wonder why Neal would kill her? Not enough of a motive.
Susanne  you are a gifted thinker. Don’t be so hard on yourself.  As always, love the memories of Penelope. But maybe you can start making new memories.

NEW TRIAL DATE

May 20th
Penelope—
So there it is, finally:  New Trial Date Set for Neal Lourdes Accused of the Murder of Penelope Rutherford. I asked Ben “Do you think they have sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Neal Lourdes committed the crime?”
“It’s hard to say right now” he said “but they did find Neal Lourdes’s DNA on her undergarments and his alibi fell through. Let’s just say it’s not looking so good for Neal.”
 “Will he serve a life sentence?”
 “Yes, if he is charged with first degree murder.”
 “What does that mean?”
 “First degree means it was premeditated murder and committed with what’s referred to as aforementioned malice.” 
 “What about second degree murder?”
“Second degree murder is usually given to crimes of passion. It’s not a planned murder but he could still get up to 40 years.”  
 “Will Neal’s lawyer use the insanity defense?”
“Doubtful but it’s not ruled out, yet.”
I started thinking more about it. I wondered how Trudy could let Neal go to prison. She must have been lying. Otherwise, she would have said something by now. It’s almost definite that he will be accused. Penelope, how could he have done it? 
Seth

THE VOICES


May 25th
Penelope—
Go. I woke up to your voice in my head. Go. Crazy people hear voices. You’ve been gone seven months. Maybe it’s my voice. I can’t distinguish anymore. Neal’s trial keeps getting delayed. I can’t take it anymore. I think you mean go to the police. But, what if it was me? Maybe you want me to get caught. Could I have blacked out? Could I have had some kind of psychotic break? I am on medication. I see a shrink. It’s in my records. I’m obviously disturbed. I could have done it and not even know. I imagine it as if it were so real. How else could I do that unless it was me that experienced it all?  I keep backing down. Maybe it’s the warm weather. I don’t know. June is almost here. It is close to 80 degrees. I feel as if the earth is overheating and we will explode. Dorrie has been trying so hard to talk to me. She told me that she had one more chapter left to her book. She better hurry if we are going to explode. And anyway, why does she think I care about that? She has a bunch of children’s books published about birds and stones and failed Quests. But this is her first older fiction:  The Trouble with Adley. I asked her why she was writing about a troubled boy and she just assured me it wasn’t about me. I won’t read it. I’ve got enough troubles. And I hate the name Adley. I didn’t tell her that, or that I think I murdered you. I don’t think I murdered you, Pen. But if I did, I deserve to be locked up. I think the truth will be revealed. I will do what you want me to do. I will go.

PURPLE CROCUSES

June 1st
Penelope—
JUNE and school is almost over. Memories are painful: we ride our bikes to the Farmer’s Market at Penwood Park. We stop at a field. You want to pick flowers; the purple flowers. I tell you, that they will be dead by the time we return.  I’m wrong. They are only wilted, purple crocuses. You put them into water and they spring back to life. If only people could too.
 I don’t see you anymore. I see a FOR SALE sign outside in your front yard. Your parents are finally moving. I think it is too painful for them to stay without you, Penelope. I think they tried. Who could blame them? I will go to the police on Monday.
Seth

Heather it was so fun yesterday. I can’t wait to see you again! PM’d  you pics and poem.
And I meant what I said. I really can go with you to the police. Let me know.

THE MANIPULATION
June 3rd

Penelope—
You would be devastated. I saw on the news that oil is gushing from a deep well beneath the ocean, in the gulf. They can’t stop it. Birds and turtles are soaked in oil. The air is heavy with sadness, greasy and gushing with bad waves…and while the oil gushes illegal immigrants cross the border in droves, unstoppable, looking for something better here in this country. Just imagine what they’re coming from!!!  We want to stop what can’t always be controlled. Our world is beyond our grasp. Neal wanted to control you. He would have done anything to make you his—even kill you. He was a like a virus that crawled into your hard drive and spread. You’re a neat kid, you said to me, I remember, two days before you were murdered. Weird how little things stick in your brain and keep repeating like a hiccup. 
Trudy’s kiss felt like I was floating. I wonder where she is now. I remember feeling an urge to crush her with my body. I don’t know if that’s good. Maybe I am a stalker. Maybe it was me, the one that crushed my best friend. No, I could never do it. I’m so sorry Penelope. How can I think such things? I need to go to the police. Edward Leedskanlin tried to manipulate gravity. We all are born with an innate desire to control. I go to the police, tomorrow.

WORDS

June 5th
Penelope—
Three weeks left. Took the math test and barely passed. Dorian said I should get a tutor for the summer. I agreed with him because I didn’t want to argue or listen to a lecture. Penelope, you always told me I should always study hard. I never understood what study hard meant. I just pretended to know. It made you happy.  You loved reading and poetry. You loved words. I guess I do too. I loathe math.

FLIP FLOPS

June 10th
Penelope—
I think of the oddest things. When Neal was taken away, it was mid-afternoon. The police came to his house, and took him away in handcuffs. I saw him on channel 3 news His head was down. He was wearing a light blue tee-shirt and dark jeans. He was in flip flops. I thought about how (if convicted) he would never again wear flip flops. His flips would be part of some past life that would fade like those strange bits of light that hang on after you turn off the computer. He had on the same flip flops when he was with Trudy, the night her grandfather passed.  I’m going to call the detective division tomorrow. This time it’s for real. 
COMMENTS
2 cents flip-flops in prison…maybe. He can wear them in the shower room. Love my flip flops. That would suck.
Heather yep, I live in my flips all summer. Coming over tonight? Xo

PTSS
June 15th
Penelope—
I’ve been reading, lately. That’s good. I’m returning to an old self with revisions. I read the government will help soldiers with PTSS or Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. Before soldiers would have to prove an incident caused their anxiety and soldiers became agoraphobic, didn’t leave his house. I’m glad Francis won’t have to worry. If he has PTSS he can get some counseling and whatever else he needs until he gets better.  I’m going to the police today.
Seth

2cents yep been there done that no way to avoid that PTSS after deployment; it changes you in ways you never expect it will.

FADING

June 19th
Penelope—
No, I didn’t call the police.  Don’t ask me why. I can’t explain. School is coming to an end.  It’s supposed to be a relaxed time, but no, it’s utter chaos. Kids are louder and teachers seem to give up control. We’ve had at least two end-of-the-year fieldtrips that I passed on.  I miss you, Penelope. You are fading and it scares me.
Seth
COMMENTS
Heather  I missed you today xo. I wish you had come to the park. It was gorgeous outside. I’ve got lots of pics. Dorian slipped and fell into the pond. It was hilarious. McDermott had on shorts and her legs were like a sixteen-year old!!! It was bizarre. Surgery? 

TRICKY GREY AREAS 
June 20th
Penelope—
Go. Go. Go. 
You are in my head more than ever these past few days. I keep trying to ignore. Maybe you are trying to say a final goodbye. Maybe I’m not ready. I won’t even look at your house. I can’t. I’m trying so hard to hold on, Penelope. You’re not making it easy. I found Neal Lourdes’s FB page. He had photographs of his dumb truck—Neal standing by his truck and one with you standing by his truck. Then there’s one with him at the beach, a wave breaking in the background. He’s not smiling (maybe he missed his truck). Instead of his truck, there’s you leaning on him, wearing a pink tee with cut-off jean shorts (your favorite shorts). There is a patch of a peace sign sewn onto the back pocket. I think you liked me because I talked you about the waves, the future, how we are all controlled by energy. I said you had positive waves. That’s cool, you slapped my arm. You’re so neat, you told me. I didn’t know how to respond. I wanted to kiss you. But I was a coward. I just kept talking about cyber waves the speed of data traveling through a copper wire. In the pic Neal had his big arm slung over you. He’s a weight lifting kind of guy. He could have easily used that strong arm to hold you, squish your soft neck until you couldn’t breathe. What did you see in him? Maybe he made you feel safe? I know that sounds like a major contradiction. Grey areas leak in and they are powerful and tricky.
COMMENTS
Jabberwocky9 grey areas leaking in…a neat idea and explains our inability to always know and make the right choices.

HEAVY STATIC DAY

June 29th
Penelope—
Head was quiet today. Days like these and I think the meds are finally working. I felt okay, getting out of bed. I avoided looking at your house last night and this morning. I don’t want to see you, Penelope. I just can’t do it. The last day of school, kids were stuffed into a hot auditorium watching video clips of the past year. Poorly shot clips by the film crew who aren’t exactly talented but have always been considered the film crew. I’m typing this, and I’m alone, and I feel displaced.  Last year, you walked home with me. This year, I walked home alone. It’s okay though. Hard to believe I’m officially done with ninth grade. I am no longer a freshman.  It doesn’t feel much different. You would have been graduating, going off to college. You said you wanted to major in English and become a professor or journalist. Now, you’re dead. I didn’t want to go to the end of the year party. I stayed home and blanked out, tried to clean the drive, clear my mind of all excess. I’m stuck.   Lost the cottage we had reserved for in July because Benny boy had to postpone vacation time for some work stuff. Now we can’t go until August! I’m really stuck and hot. Did I already say that? Static is heavy.
pm
I know there’s something I need to do. I know I need to go to the police.  I can’t.  What if it’s me? What if they can tell? I’ll be arrested, it will all come flooding back to me, a repressed memory, how I was angry at you for deceiving me, for pretending to want me and then being with Neal. Maybe I got a ride to the park, told you to meet me there. You would never have suspected. Maybe I confessed, told you I wanted you for myself and then tried to kiss you. You would have been so scared of this person, this maniac that you thought you knew. I can see your face now. I see it in my head. It’s horrible. I can’t get it out. I can’t think anymore. Why did I go that far? If I did do it, I deserve to be dead.

NEAL’S HARLEY 

July 1st
Penelope—
Head was quiet today. No bad dreams. I’m feeling slightly better. I had to take a Benadryl to get to sleep. It knocked me right out. I swear I saw Neal Lourdes riding his Harley in the center. I think it was Trudy Markus on the back. She was holding onto him and resting her head on his shoulder. I don’t know how he doesn’t get caught. I’m sure he’s not supposed to be driving his Harley around town. I guess he doesn’t care. It made me think of the day he bought it, tried to get you on the back:
We are sitting on the curb. It’s hot, close to 90s. You are wearing jean shorts, cut-offs. It is the first really hot day of the season. You have on a cotton shirt with a big sunflower on the front. You have a band aide on your left knee. We are eating licorice. You say to me:  I wish we had black licorice. You want to ride bikes to Blue Black Square to get some black licorice. I think it’s too hot, I tell you. But, then, I am going to change my mind and it’s too late because Neal drives up on his new Harley Davidson. The sound is deafening. He pulls up alongside me. The heat from the engine burns my knees. I stand up and move away. He tilts his head to say hello. He doesn’t call me wimp boy. You ignore me then and hit Neal on the arm in the same way you had hit me moments ago: where did you get this thing?  You like him better, I decide, because he has a Harley. He tells you to hop on, and you say no, and that you are too afraid.  I walk away. You never get on the back. I worry the whole rest of the afternoon that you might. We never did ride our bikes to the center that day. 
COMMENTS
Susanne I hear you’re going to the beach? I’d love to see Francis (and you of course). It’s been SO long.  When are you going and for how long? Maybe I’ll visit for the day. Btw: Pen did love black licorice and jelly beans : (  I still miss her so much.

INTENSE WAVES AND PRECOGNITION
July 2nd
Penelope—
It feels weird to not go to school. So, I’ve been reading the newspaper. Ben and Dorrie stare at me. I can feel their eyes on me. I think they like that I’m reading. I hate that. I want to be left alone so I don’t look at them or talk. I just read with my head down. 
I read how an Australian psychic led a search team to a missing woman; it was supposed to be a little girl. The woman psychic had what’s called a precognitive dream. I know when the phone is going to ring, and I can complete Dorrie’s sentences. I used to complete yours too, Penelope. Waves can be so intense that they shut down electrical appliances or make the computers run slow. Too many misfires or disconnects might just shut down air traffic control one day. The Australian woman said she had a sense. She looked tired. I bet it makes you tired, this kind of knowing—and scared too.  I can relate. I’m tired. And I’m scared.

Jabberwocky9 My dreams come true. One time I dreamt that a tree was falling on me.  The next day, we had a wind storm and our car was hit by a tree. I was the only one in it. But I didn’t get hurt. Another time, I dreamt that my dad got hit by lightning. The next day, he plugged in the coffee pot and well you get the drift.

THE DIME STORY AND EMBEDDED WAVES

July 3rd
Penelope—
Okay, I woke up today and found three dimes!  Penelope is this a new sign from you? Neal told me one day he would kill me. I ignored him. It was a great day. We were sitting outside on the front step. Neal was trying to get your attention, but you didn’t’ care. We were talking about finding dimes:  I found four today!  You held out your palm, showed me the dimes. You told me how you were waiting in line at the grocery store and this old man who looked like your dead grandfather dropped a dime. You watched it spin, him bend down and try to pick it up. I almost helped, but then he got it, you said. He just smiled at me and then walked away. Then, you dropped a dime and it spun in the same way.  You went outside, tried to find him, and you couldn’t: It was like he disappeared. I felt so weird!  I actually felt so unbelievably sad and started crying. I don’t know why I would cry! you said.  Ever since the dime story, we both found dimes everywhere. I found a dime in my pocket. You found one on the ground near the washing machine. In fact, to this day, every time I walk, I come across a dime. Neal could have cared less. He didn’t know anything about the dime story. It was our secret. “Maybe he was the ghost of your grandfather?”  I asked.
 “I don’t know. But I am still finding dimes everywhere! You said.
 “I know me too!”
Neal looked at me and then you and shook his head and muttered—wacked.  
What are the chances? It’s a sign. Some kind of message from beyond, you said. 
We were laughing and Neal didn’t like it. “Are you coming with me or what?”
He wanted you go with him. I knew you wanted to stay with me and talk about dimes some more.
What about my bike? you asked still chuckling. 
 “Put it in the truck or leave the damn thing.”
 “I don’t think she wants to go,” I said.
 “Did I ask you, wimp boy? Penelope, let’s get out of here,” Neal demanded.
 “I just don’t think she wants to go.”
“I will kill you if you interrupt one more time wimp boy.”
You hit Neal in the arm and said, Okay, okay.  You left your bike. I didn’t care what Neal said because I knew then that you were my friend and that Neal was like a Pop-up or a bug you would eventually clear from your system. You would find a way, I decided. Two days later you were murdered.  Maybe he sensed it, the rejection, the ebbing waves and he couldn’t handle it. Or maybe I didn’t want to wait for you anymore. I had to have you whatever it took. No! I would know. I would know if I did that to you. I would never hurt you, Penelope. 
pm
I’ve been reading more on waves, Penelope, anything to get my mind off of stuff.  Here’s my theory on embedded waves: Embedded waves can be either good or bad. If they are bad, they are dark and sinister and result in violence, verbal or physical or both.  Emmet Price might have tried to shake embedded waves with his painting. Good can cancel out the bad. I always knew you had more good waves than bad. They weren’t strong enough for Neal. He tried to get at them, take some for himself, but couldn’t because he had too many bad charges from years of abuse. If a person has a deficit, they will try to steal someone else’s. If that doesn’t work, they will destroy the good because it results in an imbalance, a direct opposition to their perception and sense of self. The fear of losing the self is too powerful. 
Seth
Heather I like to color when I’m feeling bad. It always calms me down. Did you get my picture? Fireworks at park tonight @ 7:30—meet me at my house.
Jabberwocky9 Music calms the savage beast. Happy summer!  YIPPPEEEE!!
Susanne I know the dime story. Penelope told me about it. She was convinced it was her grandfather even though she never met him (based on photographs). Neal was such a bully to you and Penelope. It makes me so mad now. I wish I had stuck up for her. I didn’t say enough. She really wanted to get away from him! What was I thinking?

THE CONFLICT
July 10th
 Penelope—
Head was quiet this morning. It poured all day. I was tempted to look out the window, look for you Penelope. I wanted to see you so badly. But I can’t. I’m in a horrible conflict. A war is raging inside my head. I went downstairs, smelled coffee, eggs, bacon, saw Ben and Dorrie in their usual places, sitting at the kitchen table, reading. I picked up part of the paper,  avoided all eye contact. I read Shooting Massacre in Hartford Distribution Center:  Omar Thornton shot and killed eight people He was fired for steeling beer and selling it. So, he asked to get a drink of water and then shot up the place.  His girlfriend said he was treated poorly, overheard racial slurs in the bathroom.  Out of hundreds of employees only a few blacks were employed. And Twins drowned in pool. Mother worked double shift, fell asleep, twins slipped through opening in fence. Maybe one fell in and the other tried to save her. Reverend said “Ironic that twins were born together and died together.”  Now, I’m really conflicted.

Heather  I had so much fun the other night. But where have you been? Please call me xoxo.

WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS AND WI-FI
July 12th
Penelope—
I woke up and thought of Yeats…”Out of intellect and sight…And sinks at last into the night.”  I remember you saying how your dad loved William Butler Yeats. So you said that he was your second favorite poet. Death of body is final, but not so with waves that keep going—over mountains, oceans,  cities and towns and countries, over us all, pulsating like an infinite beat or an untamed beast. One day we will be a Wi-Fi world. It will move through us, spread like a tidal wave or a tsunami—a rush of energy of satellite waves over our homes and trees and parks and cities. In a perfect world, Neal Lourdes will be convicted of murder. Ben said they will probably try to get him a more lenient sentence due to his crumby upbringing. That is new information. I thought that wouldn’t make a difference. But maybe they have more on him. Before the Lourdes took him, he was genetically wired to become bad like his parents who were addicted to gambling and drugs and could care less about him. I must be blessed to have a mother like Dorrie, really blessed. I never considered that until now. Penelope is that you? Or maybe it’s the meds.  Or maybe it’s Yeats. Or maybe it’s just some new me.
“We must dance and we must sing, We are blest by everything.” William Butler Yeats.

THE TEARS

July 14th
Penelope—
I dreamt about you. I think it was you. You were holding my hand. We were younger, wading in the brook. You bent down to pick something up, and then you were gone. I spent the rest of the dream looking for you. I woke up in a panic. I couldn’t help myself. I opened the blind, moved the curtain. I looked. There was nothing. I saw the For Sale sign, the shed, an overgrown flower garden. I looked at your window. I stared and stared as if I could will you to me. You didn’t hear me. I just fell back on the bed, and I cried. I cried so hard Penelope. I’ve never cried so much in my life. I heard Dorrie shout up the stairs. She must have suspected. So, I quickly pulled myself together. I miss you, Penelope. Why did you disappear? Where are you?  Don’t leave me. I’m not ready.
Seth

Jabberwocky9 you’re getting better, letting go : )

THE NEW PHASE OF BEING
July 15th
Penelope--
I woke up hot and bored. And I fell asleep with a renewed hope. First, I woke up in a vile mood thinking that summer would drag on forever. I started missing you, really missing you. I know I said that, but this was a deep sort of painful ache, more than my blue shirt.  I wish I was at the beach. I don’t mind being alone, most times, but lately I’ve been feeling displaced and Heather is gone for a week, and I even considered calling Chad after all this time. I’m sure he wants nothing to do with me. He’s a skater now anyway. 
So after dinner, and a long painfully boring day, I went to the movies with Dorrie and Ben. We saw Alice in Wonderland. Johnny Depp played a superb Mad Hatter. I really like Ben. He’s interesting. Good thing because I know that in some cases the boyfriend can create havoc. Anyway, Ben told me that the term Mad Hatter originated from a time when the hat makers used to inhale the glue and, eventually, they turned crazy from sniffing too much glue. It was before we had unions and labor laws. We don’t know how easy we have it today. At the end, Alice is strong only after she confronts the jabberwocky and defeats it. Alice realizes that she doesn’t have to always conform, that she can have a mind of her own. She has an epiphany. She decides that it’s okay to be a little mad. My favorite part was when the queen chains the mad hatter to a table, and forces him to make her hats. The mad hatter forgets he is a prisoner, he loves to make hats so much that he forgets what he’s doing, and then Alice reminds him when she says how sorry she is that he is forced to make hats for the queen. He looks at her in utter panic and says” I must be mad!”  Alice makes him better, repeats her father’s words “Yes you are mad, bonkers. But let me tell you a secret-- all the best people are.”  
I thought of my father, myself. I decided mad isn’t so horrible a fate. And thank goodness for modern psychiatry and medication. Who knows what might have happened if I wasn’t on something. Maybe I’d end up hanging or overdosing. I just don’t know. I wanted so badly to be with you Penelope. So badly I’d have done just about anything. I feel myself altered somehow. I don’t even know how or when it happened. But each day, I’m entering a new phase of being. I don’t know if I love it. I just don’t have a choice. I’m being led by something or someone other than you, Penelope. I hope you understand. I have hope, a renewed sense of purpose.

Jabberwocky9 Yes!  Love Lewis Carroll’s poem Jabberwocky.  He was absolutely MAD when he wrote it. He may have been on drugs but he was still so BRILLIANT!  “Twas the brillig, and the slithy tove…Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  All mimsy were the borogoes, and the mome raths outgrabe.” I was only 9 when I first read it; hence the username Jabberwocky9.

THE RIGHT CONCOTION

July 17th
Penelope—
Ben and Dorrie are definitely a real thing. I’m pretty sure I heard them…ugh! It’s such a strange thing we do, Pen. And I had thought, before, that I would have wanted to be with you, for the first time. But what we had was so pure and innocent. I guess that’s all it was, nothing more. I have to admit, that I’m ready for something more serious in my life. I think about Trudy, the feel of her, imagine how it would feel with someone else (ykwim)  But anyway, I’m taking it slow for now. I’m on the mend. I’m not ready to go full board. But I’m happy for Dorrie and Benny boy.  I do think they will get married. When I asked Dorrie she smiled in her cutsie way. That means most definitely, as far as I’m concerned. I imagine Emmet won’t mind because he can’t think too much about it. I don’t know for sure, but if Emmet is mentally ill and has to take potent drugs to keep his thoughts neutral and ordered, he must have to give up the other, the wild creative parts that want to explode, help him paint and feel. But without medication, he may burn down more churches. That’s not good either. I’m on the fence with drugs. Too much is too much. But finding the right concoction, like anything, can be magic, euphoric.

2cents my aunt Lucy was diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia when she was 18-years old. She was so delusional at one point she believed she was some high ranking official and that people were spying on her. After she got on the right meds, she worked for the government, retired and lived a pretty normal life.

THE APATHY 

July 20th
Penelope—
Francis is on my mind. I know he can’t write back, but I miss him and I miss my dad, Emmet Price (even though I never knew him).  He probably can’t write either. Maybe it’s good though that I wrote to them. I don’t think it was for naught. Maybe I gave them a bit of hope in a hopeless state. You would agree, Penelope. I know you would.  I decided that I do want to see my Dad. I want to visit him and say hi, introduce myself. I should take a bus. Go. Just do it. I should go to the police too. My head has been quiet. Does that mean you don’t want me to go, Penelope? Or maybe I’m just more normal? 
Neal Lourdes new trial date is set in two weeks. I don’t have much time. I can’t let him be accused. I don’t want to get arrested or fined for withholding information, obstructing justice. What’s wrong with me? I can’t seem to do anything lately. I feel apathetic. Numb. Maybe it’s the meds. Maybe it’s just me. I feel my physical body slowing down as if the world is moving past me. I’m never hungry. I have to make myself eat. My appointment with Landau is one of these days. I’d rather not go. But then again maybe he can tweak things for me, find the perfect alchemy. Part of me, I guess, misses you. I miss hearing and seeing you, Penelope. I miss you so much it hurts. But Heather is helping me. She is helping me so much I can’t even articulate what it means. So maybe I want 100 percent which would include you, too. Maybe doc can tweak the meds just a tad bit, so I can at least see you once in a while.

RECONCILIATION AND THE MURDERER
July 23rd
Penelope—
I wonder when your parents are going to trim their bushes and weed the garden. I mean how can they expect to sell the house with an overgrown lawn and messy landscaping? I also wonder why Neal’s trial keeps getting delayed. I asked Benny boy. He said that Neal must have a good DA. I asked if there might be problems with the prosecutor’s evidence and he said possibly and that they may be delaying case as long as possible to get more evidence. Then I asked Ben if he thought Neal was guilty. He said he wasn’t sure and that we would just have to wait. Then I considered if Neal Lourdes is found guilty, he will never go home, put his feet up on the coffee table, and play video games. Neal Lourdes will never take a ride in his truck, or on his Harley Davidson, or feel the wind whip his hair. Most people don’t care. I shouldn’t care either.  I mean it’s up to him to clear his own name. If Trudy really cared about him, she’d tell the truth.
 But, then I listened to Moody on 104.9. Sometimes that station just comes on in the car. I don’t ask Dorrie to change it. Moody is a speaker that preaches about religious things. I’m not a religious zealot, but Moody has a way of speaking that is, what McDermott might refer to as, alluring. His voice is deep and dramatic and he puts emphasis on the last word of his sentence. This sermon (I guess you would call it) was about reconciliation aka forgiveness. He always has a question that he repeats which McDermott would refer to as the theme, or underlying message. The question was this: “if God forgave you in the same way that you forgave your enemies would you be truly satisfied?”  And he kept asking it so that by the end it was embedded in my brain. He talked about Jesus, and some black slave who was beat and starved and who kept envisioning Jesus and the cross. Then, Moody went on about parallels, how Jesus, too, was tried unjustly and beaten and tortured. At the end when he should have hated his enemies, he forgave them: “Forgive them Father for they know what they do.” We pulled in the driveway right at the end, when Moody repeated the question: “If God forgave you in the same way that you forgave your enemies would you be truly satisfied?”  I doubt Neal Lourdes was ever taught much of anything good from his biological parents. He was probably left alone all the time. Maybe those idiots plugged in some videos for him or set him up with computer games. Neal Lourdes, alone with his thoughts, craving human touch, became hungry. With a brain already prewired at birth to perseverate, he was susceptible, a loose cannon ready to fire. Moody’s reconciliation sermon haunts me. It’s crawled under my skin. How could I ever forgive Neal Lourdes or anyone for murdering you? I can’t. But maybe I should? According to Moody, and the moral code, I should. If I’m a good person, I should. I’m not perfect. But I know what’s right and wrong. If I don’t call the police, I might as well wait for high tide, fill my pockets with rocks and walk straight into the ocean. Meds cause suicide ideation. I hope that’s not what I’m feeling. Where are you, Penelope?

CONFESSION
July 24th
Penelope—
I never would have EVER believed Trudy Markus and I could be on the same channel. That is until today. I did it. I finally called the police. And here’s the weird part: when I called the police, Detective Joe said they already received a call that morning and they were following up on it; then he called back like a half hour later and asked if I would be willing to me to come down to the station to corroborate TRUDY MARKUS’S TESTIMONY!!! We both called on the same day. We were definitely on the same channel.  It was strictly voluntary, which means I didn’t need to go to the station.  But, I had to go, Penelope, to make it real. The idea that I was off the hook and I was not the killer and that finally the truth was surfacing made me want to explode. I was manic, euphoric. I needed a ride. So, I told Dorrie and Ben. And it gets stranger. They told me THEY KNEW! Joe had called them shortly before I spoke to him. They were waiting for me to get the call from Joe. Dorrie said it was voluntary. I told her that Joe had already informed me of my rights, and, yes, of course, I wanted to help. 
So, they drove me to the station. It was famously quiet, the way it is for these occasions. “Do you think I need a lawyer?” I asked. Ben said it wasn’t necessary.  It was a short ride that felt long. It felt weird to be in the police station parking lot. “Do you think there will be reporters when we get there?” Ben said no one knew about it yet.  But they would soon enough. I have to admit, walking up to the door, I felt powerful. I figured it was the adrenaline, a bad charge-- the imbalance of waves circulating the area. I wonder if criminals are simply confused and come to like and crave that kind of negative charge, confuse it with the positive charge. Detective Joe and another guy, Harrison greeted us at the door. They were almost giddy. I thought they should have been more serious. Ben and Dorrie came into the room and that was okay with me and the detectives. We all sat at a rectangular desk. In the middle was a tape recorder. The room was so bare. It was a depressing room. I could tell it was made for criminals. It made me feel bad for some reason. They told me they would be taping our conversation. They asked if I wanted a soda or water. I said no. I asked if I needed a lawyer (just to be sure) and they assured me that no I was not in any kind of trouble.  I recounted the whole experience with Trudy Markus. They interrupted a few times when I described Trudy’s grandfather, Emilio and what Trudy was wearing. I recalled the conversation with Trudy, verbatim.  The interview took about 20 minutes. It was over so quick. On the way out, I told the detectives they may want to consider hanging some paintings in the room. They laughed. Adults do that to me all the time. I like to be taken seriously and all they can do is laugh. On the ride home, I asked Ben if Trudy would be charged with perjury.  He said it’s a possibility. I don’t think that’s fair. She did come forth with information. “Would I be charged with perjury?”  Ben said no. My whole body went limp from the release. They won’t accuse me or imprison me. They let me go. No more questions. They thanked me. I’m free. I feel better, more rationale. I’m sure I wasn’t the one who did it. It’s not rationale. I know that now. My thoughts are clearing.

NEAL LOURDE’S ALIBI
July 31st
Penelope—
News move fast. There it was, front page in big letters:  New evidence in the Penelope Rutherford case. Neal’s alibi was corroborated. Neal was with and I mean WITH Trudy at her house the night Penelope was murdered. I can imagine it all—the two groping each other, an emptied bottle of red wine propped next to Trudy’s bed, Emilio Markus downstairs, passed out in his chair, bushy grey hair mussed, his own half emptied bottle of scotch propped up against the leg of the chair. I guess Trudy was ashamed and didn’t want to confess. She had recently admitted being gay (I thought of her with Lacy the platinum blonde) and so she was invited into the exclusive gay club at school. I don’t get it. I really don’t. Also (this one is no surprise) Neal (the tough guy who bullied you, Penelope) was threatened by Manny. Manny warned Neal that if he kept talking shit or even tried to involve Trudy, he and his boys would mess him up. He even put a knife to his throat. Neal was actually scared. Eventually, maybe with a little push from me, and Manny going to prison and her grandfather dying, Trudy realized she could actually lose Neal, and it was the real deal. She confessed that Neal Lourdes was in her bedroom from 5 p.m. until the next morning, and that, no, she wasn’t gay. A neighbor corroborated the story, saying “Oh, sure now that I think of it, around 6 a.m. I heard a Harley. It was loud as hell.  I was pissed off and looked out the window to see who it was. I would have opened the window but the damn thing is jammed.”  A second neighbor said that this same Harley was parked in the driveway at 5:45 p.m. that evening when he came home from work. Penelope was estimated to have been murdered between 6:30 p.m. and 7:00—5 miles away from Trudy’s house.  Without any substantial evidence (the DNA was not enough) Neal Lourdes was no longer a suspect in the murder of you, Penelope Rutherford. 
And, supposedly, they DO have a suspect but his name is not being revealed. I almost didn’t believe what I was reading!  I felt like I was in a dream. It was real. I felt like I was thrust in this new reality that was raw and jarring. I considered writing a letter of apology to Neal. I would admit that I believed he murdered you. I wouldn’t tell him how I imagined it, the way he did it, wrapped his hands around your neck, raped you, smothered you. But then I decided if I confessed Neal might come after me for spreading lies.  How could I have been so misled?  All that displaced negative energy flowing from me and flooding the environment. Right now, I should be ecstatic. Instead, I feel like an imposter—despicable.  I tried so hard to get Trudy to confess. Now, I feel depleted and drained. And, lastly, who murdered you, Penelope? 
Seth
COMMENTS

Susanne Everyone is on edge, wondering who it could be. At least we knew Neal and his possible motive. What if it’s some random serial murderer?  I pray they catch this guy soon!!!
@all  --just have to wait and see.  I can’t think of anything else…I’m stuck.  Neal had to choose the less of two evils—getting tortured by Manny and his boys or going to trial for the murder of Penelope…bad situation either way.

NEW SUSPECT 
August, 1st
Penelope—
It’s crazy. That guy is out there somewhere, waiting. More than 70 percent of crimes are committed by someone familiar to the victim. All I can think about now is WHO?? Who could it be that was able to get you in his vehicle? It must have been a truck or an SUV a big enough to fit your bike. Could it have been someone you knew, a neighbor? Seth says they are questioning a few suspects but no one has been charged yet. One suspect is a painter who worked for the Rutherford’s over the summer. I remember him!  I think his name was Jed something or other. He was young, had reddish curly hair, dark rimmed glasses—I think he was a teacher. He was extra friendly to you now that I think of it. Remember him, Penelope? He seemed so normal. Was it him? Send me a sign. Just one more for me.

JED FAUST 
August 2nd
Penelope—
Ben said Jed (not Ged) Faust is a prime suspect. He graduated from MIT and he is a math teacher. He has a wife and daughter. I remember him so well. He used talk a lot about his daughter, Liza. As a matter of fact, he was hyper and talked all the time. He liked you and kept talking about tutoring you in math. He let you climb the ladder and paint. I recall it all now, the way he looked at you, held your legs on the ladder, put his hand on your back, your shoulder.  I can’t think of anything else. A signal is fixed itself in a point in my brain and keeps spinning like Edward Leedskanlin’s North and South poles, creating a whorl of currents in my brain. Please Penelope, one more time. Is it him? Is it Jed that did those horrible things to you?  
Seth
4 a.m. (can’t sleep)
I had a dream.  You were knocking. I could see you through the beveled glass of the front door. I heard you voice. You were telling me to open up that you had jelly beans for me. I tried to get to the door but it was taking a long time. All energy slowed. I felt a resistance. My legs were stuck as if I were sinking in black muck. Your voice was fading and I couldn’t get to you. Then I saw him, just a quick glimpse of his curls, the dark rimmed glasses. He looked at me askance. The light was slowly waning. It was completely dark inside by time I reached the door. When I opened it, I could hear crickets. The moon was full and blue. But you were nowhere. I heard the sound of a truck. The motor was somewhere in the distance and then I woke up. I felt sick. I know now it was Jed Faust.

THE WAITING
August 3rd 
Penelope—
It’s not over yet. Residual currents are powerful. I don’t know how I could have been so convinced that Neal was a killer.  Ben and Dorrie are packing for White Sands. We leave in a week. I can’t say that I’m overly excited. I feel strange lately now that I don’t know who killed you, Penelope. I’m tired of waiting. My whole life feels like waiting. I’m on pause. Maybe if my dad would contact me, it would take some of the burden off.  Even though it’s a good thing, that Neal didn’t kill you, at least you knew him and he was familiar. I know who did it. You told me in my dream. It was Jed Faust. But I can’t do anything about it. I just have to wait.

Suz,

OMG, there is this painter outside. He is here for MOST of the summer. I don’t even know his name. It’s Ned or something like that. He’s outside my window right now! No shirt, Tan, buff, he is HOT. When are you coming home? You’ve got to see him. I’m waiting to get changed! I can’t even get my clothes on because he’s right there!!! I think he saw me in my underwear. UGH!

Pen

Suz,

It’s Jed Faust. He is brilliant. He graduated from MIT and wants to help me with my math. He is a teacher!!! Can you imagine?  He asked me to hold his brush. And he even let me paint a bit. He was standing so close to me I swear I almost couldn’t breathe. He looks pretty young. I wonder if it would be legal to date him. LOL
Are you still coming home next week?  I hope so!!!! I’ve been hanging out with Seth. He thinks I’m crazy because I keep talking about Jed. Oh, well. I can’t help it. You’ll see.
Pen

Suz,
OMG, Jed Faust, that painter guy, is definitely creeping me out. I was in my bedroom and he was peeking in through the window when I was sleeping!!!  I’m so freaked out. See you tomorrow. GET HOME!!!

Pen


Suz,

I’m so glad you are coming home. I really really really need your advice. I don’t want to talk to Seth or my parents because I’m afraid they’ll make a scene. You know me best, Suz. Maybe I’m overthinking it all.  But I think Jed likes me!!! I’m not kidding. I feel so confused right now. He’s constantly staring at me and the other day he asked me to help him carry out supplies to his truck.  We were joking like we do and he was behind me. Then, I felt him grab me and that was it. We actually kissed!!! PLEASE DO NOT UTTER A WORD TO ANYONE!  It felt so incredible. I can’t describe it!!! My legs were weak and I was shaking so hard afterwards. I need you, Suz. Get home. He will be here on Monday. I can’t handle this alone!  He’s married with a kid?  Is that legal?

GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS

August 4th

am

Penelope—
Ok, finally. Good news. Francis is coming home tomorrow. I just found out. This is what happened. I came downstairs this morning and Dorrie and Ben were going at it right there in front of the refrigerator (kissing I mean)—not so unusual except Dorrie isn’t usually in such a good mood that early in the morning. I mean she was laughing, throwing her head back, dramatic—like younger girls do. Actually, she reminded me of you, Heather. Same color hair. But Dorrie—come on. She’s an old lady as far as I’m concerned. Anyway, she turned to me real quick and told me the news. Francis is coming home.  I guess it will make the beach and my life somewhat bearable. I asked if we could celebrate with some wine. They both looked at me as if I just shot a cat. Then Dorrie got real serious and said to me “You’re not drinking are you Seth?”
 And of course, you know me, I can’t lie, especially to Dorrie and especially since I’ve come clean on the other stuff. “Yes, I had some wine. Trudy Markus and I used to drink at her house on the porch. I didn’t drink the whole bottle of wine or anything. I only had a one or two cups.” 
 “You’re not of age, Seth. And I really wish you had told us what was going on.”
 “I wasn’t exactly thinking straight. But it was no big deal.”
 “Do you realize, Seth, that drinking alcohol with your meds can be lethal?”
They both looked so damn grim. I just wished I had kept my mouth shut. I said yes I understood and that I’d be more careful next time.
 But then Ben piped in and said something that kind of freaked me out: “Seth, you never know what someone is going to put in your drink. That’s the problem. I know Trudy was or is your friend, but she has had some trouble with drugs and I’m not talking about prescription drugs. You just have to be careful.” 
Shoot, I never considered Trudy would put something in my drink. What if she had? Maybe when I looked away or went inside to use the bathroom. I could have died or hallucinated or had some freak out trip. Maybe I’d become addicted like her? I didn’t tell Ben or Dorrie, but that scared me. I decided I would be in control of my own drinking if I ever did drink. I just said “Okay.” Then it got me thinking that maybe she put something in there and I don’t even remember. I could have blacked out. Maybe I ran up and down the street naked. I couldn’t think about it anymore.

A SURPRISE ENCOUNTER 

August 5th
Penelope—
One day before the beach. Dorrie and Seth were out at a friend’s house. I was invited too, but decided to stay home. I felt antsy. I was researching party drugs like Ecstasy and Roofies, drugs that can get slipped into your drink. I started to panic. I mean this is what kids my age are doing right now.  Trudy is a senior. Maybe she has access to more of these drugs. She probably figured it would be okay for me. She could have easily slipped one into my wine. Or maybe she put it in the opened bottle beforehand. Who knows what I did at her house. Maybe I was knocked out and she did things to me. I started getting sweaty and felt like I couldn’t breathe. As far as I know, I’m a virgin. But maybe I’m not. Penelope, you never took drugs. I don’t think. Maybe you did too.  How do you ever know what’s real and what’s not? These are things I could talk to about and you would help me. I’m trying to envision it, what you would say to me. I can’t I’m sure of it now, that you’re fading. 
So, I decided to walk to Saint Benedict Cemetery. I wanted to find you. Except, this time, I had few expectations. So there I was, standing about fifteen feet from your tombstone, when I saw him. At first I wasn’t sure who it was bending down, crouched near your marker. I got a bit closer and then I knew it was Neal Lourdes. I was about four feet away, when I heard it—sobbing. At first, I thought he was just sneezing but then I realized Neal was crying. He was doubled over, and he was bawling. I was frozen—not sure if I should get closer, pat his back. What would I say? I thought of it, in that brief moment of doubt, I considered what I might say to him. How are you? What’s the matter? I’m Sorry.  None of it would work, I concluded, so I walked back home. That was that. I packed for the beach.  Something about that image jarred me back into reality. Real raw reality and I didn’t mind so much being there.

REJUVINATION

August 6th
Penelope—
Jed Faust has not been arrested yet.  We left for the beach anyway. Dorrie said the beach would rejuvenate me. The ocean does have a way of smoothing out the fuzzy areas. The smell of the marsh, the cool ocean breeze, it is simple and calm, pure tranquility. I guess these are good adjectives to describe the beach. You always loved the beach too, Penelope. Maybe you’re with me now. I hope so. But the best part—Francis is here. He came early! He looks the same. He is tanned and healthy like a soldier. They all start to look the same…not sure why. He asked me if I still want to know about the proliferation of arms and I said no that I want Penelope Rutherford’s murderer arrested and locked up. He laughed and ruffled my hair which means he thinks I’m cute. I hate when he does that because it means he’s not taking me seriously. I don’t like when I discuss an issue and someone doesn’t take me seriously. Penelope, you always understood me. No matter what I discussed you always had a response. I don’t know that I will ever find another person like you. But I have found someone and she is different but helping me in ways I never thought possible. Today, I noticed the jetty, the pink granite, and I recalled your tombstone. I didn’t get sad. I just noticed it that’s all. I love the sounds of the tide moving in and out; it is soothing like the blood rushing in and out of veins, or energy moving through copper wires. Peace.

A MOMENT WITH FRANCIS

August  8th

Penelope—
A perfect day with Francis:  “Salt air heals all that ails” Francis said. You would have liked it, Pen. We were sitting on the jetty crabbing. We used string and chunks of chicken tied to the end. We dipped the string down in between the rocks where the water flushes in and out.       
“Did you ever hear the expression salt of the earth?” he asked me.
“I think so. Did you ever drink wine?”
 “That was random.”
 “I had some.” 
 “You’re not old enough.” 
 “I know. I had some with Trudy Markus.” 
 “That’s not good.”
 We caught five crabs, big ones. You could hear them scraping the sides of the bucket. 
“Okay, done…time to find some sea glass now,” Francis said as he tipped the bucket and dumped the crabs back into the ocean. He always dumped the crabs right away. Not me. Remember Penelope?  I would keep them in the bucket like a treasure underneath the cottage. You would yell at me: that’s so cruel, Seth. How would you like it?  I always meant to put them back into the ocean. But I’d forget and a few days later they’d start to smell. Then I’d feel so bad I couldn’t talk for a week. 
We walked. Our heads were down, searching for sea glass. “Are you a virgin?  I asked him.  He laughed hysterically. Then I laughed too. “Well, are you or not?” He just kept laughing. Finally, he said, no. Then I confessed more about Trudy Markus, how I thought she may have drugged me and taken advantage of me.
“You think she drugged you?”  Francis asked me. I told him no, probably not, but that we did have wine and kissed and a bit more. Then he laughed again. And then I asked him if had to kill anyone yet. He was real quiet. Then he walked faster, ahead of me. He never answered the question. I guess that means he did. If I could pour salt all over my brother and heal him, I would do it.

A BROTHER THING

August 9th
Penelope—
Francis will be gone soon. I hate that word, gone. It scares the crap out me. We were all reading at the kitchen table this morning. This one is bigger than at home. In fact, it’s the dining room table too.  I read weird bird news:  Thousands of blackbirds fall dead from the sky in Beebe Arkansas…500 more in Louisiana.  Birds have an internal compass for navigation. Some cells in their beaks or eyes sense the field like a sixth sense. Maybe the field went haywire?  Other theories:  possible fireworks scared them to death; hit by a lightning bolt or hail storm; alien abduction—aliens shot the blackbird souls out of each bird and left their shell. My theory:  electromagnetic field overloads. Bolts of electricity like lightening but caused by satellite waves penetrated the air, spread out in one mile radius.  First, it drew the blackbirds to it like a magnet, and then zapped them with its mega force. I’m sure it can be corroborated if I look hard enough. I haven’t had time. I have lots on my mind like your murderer, Pen.
But then today Ben said they have someone in custody. He said he thinks it’s a math teacher, Jed Faust. I felt euphoric when he said that. But still I can’t be sure. I’m also thinking about Trudy and Neal. I wonder I they are still together. Or, if Trudy got smart and gave him the boot.

Big news after chocolate crème pie, dessert:  Seth and Dorrie announced their engagement. They will be married on 11/11—this year!  I’m not surprised. I took a photo of her hand and Ben’s grandmother’s ring. I’m happy that Benny boy will be my step-dad, officially. Heather came to visit mid-afternoon, and we took a walk on the beach after dinner. We built a bonfire. It was perfect. But with the good comes the bad:  before I went to sleep, I thought of Emmet Price returning in a violent manic rage. Maybe it was the chocolate crème pie, or the weird bird incident, or the dead crab memory. I dreamt of my father. He came to the beach. We wouldn’t let him in so he raced around the cottage yelling and swearing. Even Francis was scared. We cowered in the upstairs closet. I smelled the cedar in my dream!  I wanted to go to the window, to see him. Francis pulled me back. One time, he didn’t and I saw him. Emmet Price, my father, was wild with long hair, hunched over like a mad man. When he ran his arms were extended outward in front of him, oddly, as if he were blind and being led by some magnetic force, like the Blackhawks, lured in by some frenetic frenzy to their death. The sky got really dark and I saw the waves breaking closer, inches from my father. I saw him kneel down as if he were giving up. Then he looked up at me. And it was me, my face. I woke up yelling Francis’s name. I felt strange after. Not so much scared but sadder as if I lost something irretrievable. Almost like you and the dime story and your lost grandfather. Francis took me downstairs and we made chocolate milk and ham sandwiches. We watched Family Guy. I told him I missed you, Penelope. He said he did too. I felt 300 times better. We both fell asleep on the couch. I loved how we woke up together—like the old days. His arm was draped over me. I never felt so safe in my life.

Jabberwocky9 Do you know that bad dreams are residual subconscious thoughts that we want to suppress. No suppressing. It all comes out, eventually.
@jabberwock9  yes, I had heard about dreams being suppressed thoughts. I guess the idea of my father is scary. When I meet him and talk to him, I will feel better (soon I hope).
Heather I had so much fun yesterday with you and your brother. I heard you last night and wanted to help but I didn’t think it would be polite. Xo
@ heather  Ah!  Thanks…it was a brother thing.

LOVE AND THE MAGNETIC DRAW

August 15th
 Penelope—
You are gone. I know that. I can say it now. The notion of loss has been weathered. But when someone leaves me, the wound opens. Heather went home.  And now Francis is gone. He left two days ago. It was such a void. It’s always harder for the ones left behind.  I wanted to go home, too. But Ben and Dorrie were so giddy. They were like two couples in a movie, dancing and making out on the jetty, wading in the water, everywhere. I could have taken a video and posted it on YouTube. I would call Love at White Sands Beach. I could set it to some pop or rap music and even do a remix on it. I would get millions of views. It would go viral. Then, I could sell tee-shirts and mugs and get invited on Oprah or Ellen. I’d never have to return to school again. Love is one big major magnetic draw. It has this common allure, a mysterious force that draws people together, makes them seek each other out. I was drawn to three people like that: Dorrie, Francis and you, Penelope. I thought Trudy too but that was more like a spell or an addiction. I know the other feeling. And when the attraction is strong, and person is absent, it gives you an incomplete sort of feeling, as if you are being pulled in an indistinct way sort of like a kite that is almost airborne but keeps crashing. I feel you Penelope but I know now that you are not in the physical world. I just get a whoosh of you now and again. And my friend, Heather, she is here and she is real and helping me in ways I never imagined. 
Seth

Jabberwock9I love your kite analogy Seth. I love your blog (if I haven’t told you yet). You have an incredible way with words. I know that feeling so well. When someone you love moves in and out of your life it is so inconsistent! 
Susanne I found three dimes today. One on my way into the bathroom, second one was on my way into the store, and the third I found in my pocket!!!  Penelope was with me today!
Heather sweetie. XXOO



HOT AUGUST AND EMILY DICKENSON


August 25th
 

Penelope—

I am home. I have eleven more days left of summer. Freshman year seems like a life time ago. I will be a sophomore.  It has been hot, really hot for the past three weeks. The heat waves are intense.  Jed Faust was arrested and his trial is in a few weeks. I saw Neal a couple of times, and he looked at me and said, hey, both times. He seems more, what’s the word… humble. But I’ve been tricked before. Still, I know now he is not a murderer. There is hope for him. His truck is always parked in Trudy’s driveway which means they are living there. They even started a garden on the side of the yard. I see Trudy kneeling down, a bandana on her head, digging or watering. But she still walks up and down the street smoking her brown cherry cigarettes. I caught her once when I was rolling out the garbage pails. She said “Hey, Seth Price! How goes it dude?” And I chuckled and snapped the lids on tight. She just stood there blowing out smoke waiting for something. I don’t know what. So I asked her if she had a garden. She told me she did and that she even had some tomatoes if I wanted some. 
“How are things going?”  I asked. 
And she said “Dandy. Come over some time, Seth! I miss our chats on the porch! I always liked you Seth Price. I mean it. You’re so fun!  Plus, I got so many damn tomatoes. They’ll rot if you don’t take them.”
 “I liked you too, Trudy Markus” I said. I didn’t tell her I didn’t want her tomatoes or that I probably wouldn’t be hanging out at her house any time soon. 
 “Well, don’t be shy. Come over soon. I don’t bite, okay?” and she walked away, holding her hand up the way she does, in a goodbye gesture.
 “Okay,” I said and watched her walk away. I wanted to chase after her and ask her if she drugged me. But how would I say it? “I was just wondering, did you put drugs in my wine and take advantage of me?” No, too weird. 
 On a lighter note, Dorrie said we can go visit Emmet soon. She spoke to his doctor and he said Emmet has been settling into a new routine and living arrangement and would like a few more weeks. I wonder if Emmet said that, or if the doctor just assumed he needed more time. The mentally ill don’t have much of a voice. But, I can feel his waves lately. I know he is trying to reach me, somehow. But as I was saying, it’s been an unusually hot August and I have this one memory a few weeks before my first year at Charles Pond High School and you, Penelope—your  last year, a couple months before you were killed. I remember it like it was yesterday and have been thinking about it all the time lately. It replays in my head like a movie clip.  It may just be my last summer memory of you, Penelope. The last one that I put down in words: 
It’s close to 100 degrees. We are sitting on the side of my yard. The grass is brown. The flower garden is wilted and dried. It’s so hot you can see waves, the heat rise off the driveway. When the wind blows the air is hot like a blow dryer. We are sitting in wrought iron chairs painted light pink.  The umbrella casts a shadow but still doesn’t shield the heat. You are wearing a halter top that ties around your neck. It is light green cotton and has tiny flowers. Your arms are long and thin and light tan. You wear a Scarab bracelet given to you on your tenth birthday from your grandmother, and a wood beaded necklace with a Yin Yang pendant.  It’s inspired by the sea and handcrafted by Indians, you told Neal after he made fun of it. You have a sanguine glow and your face is rosy from the heat. We are eating jelly beans and sliced melon off a crystal plate and we have tall glasses filled with lemonade and a lemon wedge on the sides of our glasses. We are giddy from the heat. You lean back in her chair, your barefoot rests up against the table. Your toe nails are painted pink like the table and the front of your feet are tan, the bottoms are black. You are reciting Emily Dickenson’s poem using a British accent: Because I could not stop for death he kindly stopped for me… I watch your arms extend. I love how you are so animated as if you are swallowing the world: The carriage held but just ourselves…And immortality. 
 “Passing into death?”  I ask you.     
 But you ignore me and continue: We slowly drove, he knew no haste, And I had put away…My labor, and my leisure too…for his civility. 
 “Who is HE?  Is it death?”  I think it is but I’m not 100 percent sure and I want to know so I keep asking and it makes you laugh. 
We passed the school, where children strove…At recess, in the ring…We passed the fields of gazing grain…We passed the setting sun. 
I don’t care anymore what it means. I sit back and listen. Your voice freezes me to the spot.
 We paused before a house that seemed…A swelling of the ground…The roof was scarcely visible…The cornice but a mound. You stand and move your arms in front of you and all around your body as if conducting a symphony: Then out of nowhere you run towards the sprinkler. I think you will jump through it, but instead you bend down. Before I know it, you are coming towards me with the hose. The energy is manic and I like it. The stream hits me. It feels like razors. I have never liked the surprise of water. The few times someone tried to throw me in a pool or the ocean or spray me with a hose, I would freak. Now, Penelope, you are spraying me, and the water is cold and my skin tingles and I like it. I run towards you to take the hose away. You try to get away and slip on the wet grass. I have you in my arms. I pry your hands off the nozzle. We are both laughing. I smell your wet hair. It touches my mouth. I want to eat it. My body is against yours and I feel a sensation that is jarring. When I do get the nozzle, you are up and running. I hold down the handle and the stream shoots outward. It hits you. You arch your back and screech.  I feel a strange sense of power as I do it. Stop! Seth, Stop!  you shout. I drop the hose. We walk back to the table, breathless, dripping, take a sip of our lemonade and you toast:  to my two dear friends, Emily Dickenson and Seth Price. 
Just as our glasses touch and chime, I hear Neal. The sound of his Harley reverberates against the air like a wall of demons screaming. He rides right up to the table, the tires spewing grass and mud. He turns the key and the engine winds down. “You look like a wet rat,” he tells you.
Well, now, that’s not very nice, you say, spinning, jovial, still giddy from the hose and the heat. 
Then he stares at me and I think he wants to hit me. Instead, he gestures to you to get on his bike. For the first time, I notice your indifference, the way you ignore him, take the lemon wedge and suck on it, purse your lips, and then recite the last verse of the poem: Since then 'tis centuries and yet each…feels shorter than the day… I first surmised the horses' heads…Were toward eternity. It’s as if Emily Dickenson entered your body and empowered you. 
Neal looks on confused, angrier than ever: “What the hell is your deal? Did pretty boy here spike your lemonade?” 
You keep spinning on your heels, and then drop down into the chair, throw the lemon wedge in Neal’s direction. It bounces off his front tire. Don’t you know Emily Dickenson’s famous poem? Death is personified as a suitor? No…I suppose you wouldn’t. Your smile fades. Get lost, Neal, you say.  
My heart starts racing. I think of what he could do. Yet, what I expect does not happen. Instead, Neal pauses for a moment. I feel his eyes on me, but I don’t look. I hear him turn the key, rev his bike and take off. I should feel satisfied. Instead, I am anxious. I sense that there is more to come. Death is personified as a suitor. Your words hang in the air long after the sound of Neal’s Harley is nothing more than an annoying buzz. But that’s the problem with the events—they are not always satisfied with remaining in one state. Once I had a rash that didn’t stay a rash. It turned into a poison oak mess all over my body and I had to take steroids. Something bellows out, an energy that needs to release itself. It knows it must before it explodes. It is alive and potentially dangerous, so that what is perceived as innocuous is the calm before the storm. And it’s messy and deceiving.  It wasn’t Neal. It was a sociopath that had no remorse. Neal was merely a foreshadowing of worse things to come.

LAST HOURS
October 30th
LAST ENTRY in A Blog for Penelope
Reprint from Ed Leedskalnin Advertisement
The Miami Daily News 1945
Attention Researchers! 
Read about magnetic current, what it is, how it is made, what makes it, and the way it runs in the wire. Then you will know what the North and South Pole individual magnets can do, and then you will know what electricity is. Send a dollar by return mail and you will get an eight thousand word booklet, postpaid, and in addition you will get a folder describing what is mineral, vegetable and animal life, and a drawing of a perpetual motion holder. The reading is not intended for the general public. Only those who want to experiment should order the booklet. The other people should save their money.
"I have discovered the secrets of the pyramids, and have found out how the Egyptians and the ancient builders in Peru, Yucatan, and Asia, with only primitive tools, raised and set
in place blocks of stone weighing many tons!" 
~Edward Leedskalnin, 1945
I guess Ed had to make a living like all of us. Today it would be more than a $1.00 for his pamphlet. Ed died with his secrets. But, here’s my take on it:  he found the spot, where all energy converges and orchestrates channels of energy like musical notes perfectly pitched rising up from the North and South poles.  Once you get that spot, you can manipulate the waves and move mountains (so to speak). All gravity disappears, magic happens. I imagine you, Penelope, there now, encapsulated in a cyclone, whorls of energy masses where beads of light bounce off your fingertips and shine like diamonds in your eyes. You float, weightless, transcending the physical world, become a wisp of wind swooshing by. 
Last Hours, October 30th
I see you after school. You are laughing, throwing your head back, hair loose and flipping, walking with Susanne. You are eating jelly beans from a bag. I know it even though I can’t see the candy. I can tell by the way you bring the jelly bean up to your mouth and look at it before you eat it. Susanne is smoking a cigarette. That’s why you go for a walk. I see the smoke snake up into the air and dissipate. My window is open and so I hear you laughing, smell Susanne’s cigarette. She will stay at your house for a couple of hours and then leave at 4:30 or so. I know because your house is three houses away from mine. I can see Susanne’s yellow Volkswagen parked in the driveway. I want so badly to come down to say hello, but I’m mad at you because you never called me to ask if I was going to the dance.  I’m mad too because I saw you outside the school with Neal, leaning into his truck, and you were smiling, touching each other. When I walked by, you barely noticed me. So, I decide not to come down and say hello and tell you I’m going to the dance. I’ve never gone to a high school dance. I’m thinking about how cool I’ll look in my gangster get up, slicking my hair back with Vaseline, and talking to Chad on the phone (the friend I use for these occasions) making plans for the dance, when I see you. My window is still open and an evening chill is blowing in the last time I catch a glimpse of you on your bike. It is 5:35 p.m. I wonder why you are riding your bike to the dance. Charles Pond High is about 1.5 miles away, and it is unusually warm, but, it will be dark after the dance.  You have our backpack on.  I get a strange sense of something ominous. I turn away from the window; Chad is swearing at his younger sister, telling me he will meet me at the dance. I’m barely listening, because I’m thinking of you, Penelope, how you look as you ride away into the dark. I watch you until you are a speck. The ominous feeling is gone. I hang up the phone, hurry with my shoes, excited about the idea that I will see you at the dance. Chad has no idea. No one, not even you, knows how much I want to dance with you. I am going to ask you for a dance, I decide. I am euphoric. You never make it. I think now of the alternative endings, like the ones McDermott made us create after reading fiction. But this was not fiction.
WHAT IF?
What if I had gone outside and said hello?  You would have said NO WAY! when you saw me in my gangster costume. You would have definitely gone with me to the dance, or at least let me tag along. You would never have talked to Jed at the CVS when you stopped to get a Dr. Pepper. You wouldn’t have said yes to be polite when he asked if you wanted a ride to the school.  I would have been with you. I imagine Jed convinced you it was fine and that he was heading in that direction anyway, and he could put her bike in the back of his truck.  Jed was hyper and he would keep talking the whole time, the way he did, and you felt comfortable. Jed knew that you were too nice to say no. After all, Jed was a friend; he spent a whole summer painting your house and even had dinner with your family. We knew him. He was a teacher, married with a daughter, Liza. He was funny and harmless (so we thought).  We had lunches together. He joked about his wife, how she was always on him to stop talking. He told us how much he loved his daughter, Liza, showed us pictures of her first birthday party. The pictures showed Jed holding his wife and daughter like any normal husband and father: “Oh, man they are my life” Jed said to us, and we believed him.  Why wouldn’t we? You would make him ice tea or lemonade and he’d say to me “She’s a sweet kid, huh?” And I’d nod in agreement. I didn’t think anything of it. Jed Faust was no murderer. A husband and father doesn’t rape and kill. We never suspected. That’s the danger of crossed wires. Bad wires are often obstructed by an overload of neutral energy that masks the bad, makes it appear good due to the energy itself. Jed was just like that—full of intellect, too much energy. I know now not to trust excess energy because it could be masking something sinister. I know now how easy it is to be tricked by a sociopath with no remorse. I wish I could tell you about it, warn you. I wish I knew sooner. I know you forgive me. I can let go now. Goodbye, Penelope Rutherford.
And lastly for my followers who are interested in updates: I’m a sophomore at Charles Pond High and feel slightly different, but not significantly. I am still me, Seth Price.  I think my confusion and anxiety is waning. I still take meds but have tweaked them a bit and am slowly weaning off one of them. No, I haven’t seen my father, Emmet Price, but I’m working on another letter to him. I thought I’d ask him if I could visit.  It’s in the beginning stages (one paragraph so far).  Francis is coming home in a few weeks and will stay home for a year. Seth and Dorrie will be married in another month on 11/11. Dorrie’s book The Trouble With Adley will be published soon. It’s rumored that Neal Lourdes moved to Miami, Florida and took Trudy with him.  Jed Faust has been arrested for the murder of Penelope Rutherford. And I’m ending my blog now, on the anniversary of Penelope’s death. I’m going with my intuition. 
Thank you all for saving me, for inspiring (hope that doesn’t sound too dramatic) and especially you, Heather. You’ve taught me so much. I have found a real relationship that I know will last a long time.  Keep emailing me (for those who are) and for those who aren’t, please do it soon. I will begin a new blog (keep an eye out). For now, I am going to work on a science fiction book related to (you guessed right) emf’s and neurological functioning. I have tons of research to do, so I will be busy for the next six months.
How to end?  Let’s just say some of us know, internalize the waves intimately, and then carry it like a burden like my father, Emmet Price. He tried to paint to control the excess, but it was an overload that couldn’t be contained. Edward Leedskanlin  knew it, and he built the Coral Castle, 28 years of carving, creating.  Ed never quit.  Penelope would have channeled it in words and writing like Dorrie and Ben… and me. I know how it feels to lose someone and I’ve struggled to keep the waves in check. I can’t build a coral castle, but I can write my blog—honor Penelope, keep her alive in the words. Blogging to the dead isn’t so weird after all. We all find some way to immortalize ourselves, others; the energy current is ever present.  It’s recyclable, ebbing and flowing like the tide. If you don’t know now, you always have the opportunity to be a knower, to open yourself to the energy, just squint real hard at the water, at dusk, and you can see the beads of light, sparkles like tiny diamonds, bits of matter, the essence of life.  I would start there.  Good luck. 
Your friend,

Seth Price
