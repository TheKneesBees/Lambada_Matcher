It was 115 degrees in Las Vegas, but Paul Laurens could have sworn the temperature dropped from the chill in his former lover's gaze.

Robin Turner entered the Mondego Hotel's ground-floor lounge like a gust of arctic air. Her long blonde hair was restrained in a sleek chignon and her lush body was encased in a pale blue dress that wrapped around her curves and tied at the waist. Nude-colored heels gave the impression that she was barefoot, while a chunky aquamarine necklace circled her throat like ice cubes.

Paul's grip on his beer bottle tightened and his dick thickened in his jeans. How they'd ended up in bed together was still a mystery to him. One minute they were riding the same elevator and the next he was riding her, the attraction so fierce and immediate he couldn't remember how they reached his room or even shed their clothes.

Taking a long pull on his beer, his gaze followed Robin's progress across the barroom. She approached a booth where a guy in a suit stood to greet her. The man kissed each of her cheeks before they sat. Paul knew he couldn't stay in the same room with her and not have her, so he gestured for the bartender and ordered a martini extra-dirty to be sent to her table.

"Your brews are popular," one of the cocktail waitresses said as she collected the drink and placed it on her tray. Her smile was an invitation. The way she looked him over made sure he got the message.

"I'm glad to hear that," he replied, breaking eye contact to convey his lack of interest. Convincing the Mondego to carry his microbrews had been his first toehold in Vegas. The resort's contract funded his biweekly trips to pitch his product to other establishments in the area, which in turn had allowed him to have Robin for a year. His weekends with her had been the most valuable and treasured blocks of time in his life.

Until four months ago, when he'd f**ked up and lost her.

Tossing some bills on the bar, Paul vacated his barstool and carried his beer out to the elevators. He'd left flowers for Robin with the front desk, along with his room number in a note. Although he knew she must have checked in yesterday, she hadn't contacted him. He'd tried to convince himself that she was busy getting ready for the jewelry trade show that opened today in the hotel, but that look she'd just shot him proved the lie. His only consolation was that she wasn't indifferent to him. He could only hope that meant she wasn't totally over him. He'd take whatever he could get from her right now-an argument, a slap to the face, anything at all. As long as it gave him the opportunity to say what needed to be said.

He was stepping into the elevator when he smelled her. Inhaling deeply, Paul pulled the fragrance of vanilla and something flowery deep into his lungs. Awareness sizzled down his spine and fisted his balls, his dormant sexual needs stirring after months without her. He hit the button for his floor, then moved to the back of the car and turned around. As Robin took up a position beside him, anticipation thrummed through his veins. He briefly wondered what excuses she'd made to her companion, then he pushed the thought aside. He didn't give a shit. The only thing that mattered was that she'd followed.

An elderly couple and three suit-clad gentlemen entered the car and faced the doors. As the elevator began its ascent, Robin balanced on one stiletto, drawing Paul's gaze. He watched as she pushed her underwear down, pulling one leg free and then the other.

Jesus. His dick throbbed with eagerness and fantasies of stepping behind her, lifting her dress, and pushing into her right there filled his mind.

A soft ding signaled the first stop. The businessmen got off and four teenagers in bathing suits got on. Training his gaze straight ahead, Paul reached over and slipped his hand between the overlapping front of Robin's dress. She sidestepped closer, putting him slightly in front of her, inviting his touch. He cupped her baby-soft hairless p**sy, his fingers curling between her legs and finding her hot and damp. His dick swelled further and he finished his beer to hide a telling groan.

The car stopped again and the elderly couple exited. As the teenagers moved out of their way, the lone girl in the group glanced at Paul. Interest flared in her kohl-rimmed dark eyes. She checked him out, reading his brewery's logo on his T-shirt and eyeing the tattoo that peeked out from beneath the sleeve. She was following the line of his arm down to where he was parting the lips of Robin's cunt when the two boys with her spread out in the absence of the couple and cut off her view.

Robin sucked in a sharp breath when he pushed his middle finger inside her. Her tight, plush sex sucked at him greedily, and his eyes grew heavy-lidded, lust riding him hard. Pressing his heel to her clit, he massaged her, getting her ready for the pounding drives of his cock. He'd meant to talk with her first, but she was hot for it and God knew he was hot to give it to her. Stumbling through his life without her had been torture. At times, he thought he'd go insane from the need to hear her voice and feel her body against his.

The kids stepped off at the next stop. The car continued its ascent to the forty-fifth floor with only the two of them on board.

"I've missed you," he said gruffly.

In answer, she thrust her desire-slick p**sy into his hand. "You've missed this."

Her cool voice sliced into him, but her body betrayed her. She was scorching hot and delectably wet. As he finger-fucked her juicy cunt, soft sucking noises filled the car. Her composure lost, she gripped the brass handrail and moaned, shamelessly widening her stance.

The moment the car reached his floor, Paul pulled his fingers free and caught her up, tossing her over his shoulder and dropping his empty bottle in the trash can conveniently placed just outside the elevator. He had a condom between his teeth and his keycard in hand before he reached his suite. Kicking the door open, he propped Robin against the inside of the stationary half of the double-door entrance. His button fly was open before the latch clicked shut.

His jeans dropped to the entryway's tile, the weight of his chained wallet hitting the floor with a thud. A moment later, her lacy underwear fell from her fingers and fluttered down. As he sheathed his c*ck in latex, Robin pulled her dress up to take him. Paul paused to look at her, his chest tightening. She was unruffled elegance above the waist and a walking wet dream below it. Her legs were long and lithe, her sex pouty and glistening.

He'd been dead when she came into his life, frozen in grief over the death of his son and the subsequent dissolution of his already-broken marriage. That first elevator ride with Robin had been like a flipped switch, jolting him out of his coma. She'd forced the air back into his lungs and the blood back through his veins. He had begun to live for the weekends he spent with her, craving her laughter and smiles, her touch and her scent.

But when she'd suggested they take their relationship to the next level, he had panicked, prompting her to walk out on him with her head held high and his heart in her hands.

Reminded of how damned lucky he was to have her ready and willing again, Paul pinned her slender body against the door and took her mouth in a lush, hot kiss. His lips sealed over hers, his tongue gliding along the lower curve before slipping inside. She was stiff at first, resistant, which got his guard up. When it came to physical intimacy, they'd never had any barriers between them.

As he stroked his tongue along hers, Robin reached for his c*ck and slung one leg around his waist. She jacked him with both hands, making him so hard and thick he groaned into her mouth and slickened her fingers with pr**um. She used him to prime herself, massaging the tiny knot of her clitoris with the head of his dick. Impatient, he brushed her hands aside and tucked his cockhead into her slit. She was so ready, he slipped through her wetness and sank an inch inside her. As her cunt fluttered around him, his chest heaved with the loss of his control. What he wanted was to nail her to the door with pounding thrusts; what she needed was to know that he was committed to making their relationship work.

"Hurry," she hissed.

Before he could rein himself in, her hands gripped his ass and yanked him into her. The unexpected thrust sent him tunneling deep. His palms hit the door on either side of her head and a curse burst from his lips.

"Robin, baby," he growled. "Give me a damn minute."

But she was already coming. With her head thrown back against the door and a purely erotic moan of pleasure, her cunt tightened around his aching dick like a tender fist. When the delicate muscles began milking his length in incredible ripples, he lost it.

"Ah, shit," he gasped, feeling his balls tighten and sem*n rush to the tip of his cock. Gripping her ass in the palms of his hands, Paul f**ked her convulsing p**sy like a mad man, banging her with hammering strokes. The violent orgasm was the rawest of his life, the pleasure so pure and hot he couldn't stop the growls that tore from his throat. Or the words. "Robin... fuck... I love you, baby. Love you..."

Dripping with sweat and shaking, he sagged into her as the white-hot ecstasy eased, his h*ps grinding mindlessly as he emptied himself inside her.

She shuddered in his arms and a soft sob escaped her. "God... You're an ass, Paul. You know that?"

Fucking brilliant. He finally told her how he felt and it lacked all grace or romance. She'd walked away thinking he just wanted to get laid, and he'd hardly redeemed himself by cursing out his feelings in the middle of a full-throttle, no-preliminaries screw that had probably been heard by every guest on the floor.

His forehead touched hers.

Her arms fell to her sides, her exhales gusting over the perspiration-damp skin of his throat. "I have to go."

Paul's gut knotted. He couldn't let her walk out again. He wouldn't survive it a second time. Gripping her behind the thighs, he hefted her up and kicked free of his boots and wide-legged jeans. In just his socks and shirt, with his dick still hard and buried in the sweetest p**sy in the world, he carried her to the bedroom on shaky legs. "Not until you hear me out."

"I heard you loud and clear the last time."

Gritting his teeth, he pulled free of her and dropped her on the bed. Before she could scramble away, he caught her ankles and lifted her legs high and spread them wide. He looked down at her succulent pink p**sy, the plump folds glistening with her desire. "I wasn't done. I'm not done."

"I'm done."

He licked his lips, hungry for the taste of her. "We'll see about that."

Recognizing the intent in Paul's hazel eyes, Robin struggled to back away before he destroyed her again. She loved a man who was damaged. She could work with that if Paul wanted to heal, but he didn't. The look on his face when she'd suggested they rendezvous in his hometown of Portland had told her all she needed to know-she was his biweekly screw, his hot piece in Vegas. And everyone knew what happened in Vegas stayed in Vegas.

She'd walked out of his hotel room that night with the intention of not looking back. She had told herself Paul Laurens was just a brief spate of madness in her life. But watching him leave the bar just now had been too much for her. She'd left her brother at the table without a word, chasing a man she couldn't recover from.

One last screw, she'd told herself. And then it would be over.

Idiot. She craved him like a junky, and one fix was never enough.

Paul sank to his knees between her legs, and her womb clenched greedily. Her p**sy trembled with its eagerness to have his mouth on her; her cl*t throbbed with the need to feel his tongue stroking over it. He held her open with his hands on the backs of her thighs, his gaze riveted to her intimate flesh.

"I've been dying to eat you," he said gruffly. "I've jacked off a dozen times thinking about it. Get comfortable, baby. We'll be here awhile."

"I have meetings to attend!" she protested. "I can't-oh, god!"

The first stroke of his tongue stole her wits. It was a soft, slow lick that fired every sensitive nerve ending. The next pass was more deliberate, working her cl*t with the ball of his barbell piercing. His groan vibrated against her, making her p**sy spasm in want of his c*ck to fill it.

Her hands fisted the comforter.

"You're so sweet," he praised hoarsely, his hands sliding down to her inner thighs. "Your cunt is so soft."

A soft noise escaped her.

His mouth sealed over her cl*t in a heated circle, his pierced tongue fluttering over the hard knot with devastating strokes. Her h*ps moved without her volition, thrusting and rocking as she chased another orgasm. In her past, she'd been lucky to come once with a partner. With Paul, the more he touched her, the more sensitized she became. Each cli**x came quicker than the one before it until she was coming in rolling waves that seemed to have no end or beginning.

"Fuck me with your tongue," she gasped, draping one leg over his powerful shoulder to urge him closer. Her back arched as he obliged her, teasing her quivering slit with shallow thrusts. Gripping his overlong hair, she rode his mouth, shameless in the extremity of her need.

She'd watched people dismiss Paul out of hand because of his appearance. Those who clung to stereotypes saw mobile homes and biker gangs when they looked him. They couldn't see past the stubble-shadowed jaw and visible tattoos. But beneath the body jewelry, ink, and shaggy hair was a gorgeous face that was classical in its lines and features. Paul could have graced an ancient coin or inspired a statue in a temple, and he was far wealthier than people would ascertain from his laid-back style.

Cupping her buttocks, he lifted her h*ps and tilted his head. His tongue pushed deeper, and her p**sy clutched helplessly around the rhythmic impalement.

Robin squeezed her aching br**sts inside her bra, pinching her n**ples to ease their tightness. Her h*ps churning restlessly, she begged, "Make me come."

Latching on, he kissed her p**sy, drawing softly with gentle suction while he rubbed her cl*t with his tongue. She cried out and fell apart beneath his avid and tender mouth, her body melting into a boneless, breathless, teary puddle on his bed.

"I love you." He pushed to his feet and tossed the condom in the trash.

"You love f**king me," she whispered, knowing that when the passion was sated and reality intruded, he would withdraw again as he'd done before.

Paul leaned over her, pressing his hands into the mattress on either side of her waist. "I'm in this for the long haul."

"You think same time, same place, two weeks from now is a commitment?" She hated the tinge of bitterness in her voice. He'd never made her promises, never alluded to more than what they had during their Vegas liaisons. It wasn't fair that she was angry at him for not giving her more, but she couldn't help how she felt.

"That's not enough for me." Straightening, he yanked his T-shirt over his head. Her eyes swept hungrily over his torso, admiring the tight lacing of abdominal muscles that flexed as he moved. He was so virile. Truly breathtaking. Tattoos covered both of his arms from shoulder to elbow in gorgeous half-sleeves. His chest was broad, golden, and bare... except for her name, which crossed the pectoral over his heart. "It was never going to be enough."

Robin sucked in a tremulous breath, stunned by the sight of ink that hadn't been there previously. Her gaze rested on the new tattoo, her vision blurring with tears. "Paul..."

"I do love f**king you." He pulled a fresh condom out of the nightstand drawer and rolled it on. "When I'm not inside you, I'm thinking about it."

Setting his hands on her inner thighs, he pushed into her. She whimpered, her tender p**sy tightened by her recent orgasms.

"God, you feel good," he breathed. "I've needed you so much."

His size, so long and thick, was perfect. As if he'd been made for her. Pushing onto her elbows, Robin watched his glistening c*ck pull free. The heavily veined length was as brutal looking as the rest of him. The sight of it turned her on further. It made her feel powerfully feminine, like a freakin' sex goddess, to incite the raging lust of a man who was so potently masculine and primal in his sexuality.

Robin's tongue traced the curve of her lower lip. "Please," she whispered, feeling empty without him. She'd been feeling empty since she walked out on him, physically and emotionally.

He sank back into her with a low hiss of pleasure. "You're so sexy, baby. So damn perfect and beautiful. I have no f**king idea what you're doing with a guy like me, but I'm grateful. Every damned day."

God help her. She loved him so much.

He tugged the tie at her waist and pushed the two halves of her dress open. He released the center clasp of her bra, freeing her br**sts into his waiting palms. Her p**sy tightened around him, echoing the gentle rolling of her n**ples between his talented fingers.

"I'm so sorry." He was flushed and shiny with sweat, his beautiful hazel eyes as red as hers felt. "So damn f**king sorry that I ever let you think, for even a moment, that you were nothing but a convenient piece of ass to me. I loved you the moment I saw you. I should have told you-"

"I need things from you." She wrapped her hands around his wrists, anchoring herself as the pleasure threatened to sweep her away.

"I know." His h*ps rocked in a slow and easy tempo. "I need things from you, too."

That caught her. She wanted him to need her. She wanted to be valuable to him, to serve a purpose in his life. To share his life. "Such as?"

"I need your travel schedule." His lips kicked into a smile when she scowled. "So I can plan my trips to match up with yours. And I need you to move in with me. Your jewelry business is you, right? You can design your pieces anywhere?"

Robin nodded, unable to speak while he was saying everything she'd longed to hear and f**king her so perfectly. The fluid, rhythmic plunges of his c*ck were driving her half out of her mind. Her entire body was straining with the need to come, her h*ps lifting to meet his downstrokes. He was so hard and it felt so good to be with him again. To smell the scent of his skin and feel his flesh beneath her hands.

"I'm stuck for now with the brewery in Portland." His words slurred slightly as the pleasure built for him, too. "But if you don't like the city or the house or anything, I'll go where you're happy. I just need time, time I don't want to spend without you."

"Harder," she urged, grabbing his taut perfect ass in her hands. Her neck arched, her head pressing into the bedding as her cli**x hovered just out of reach. "Fuck me hard."

Gripping her waist, Paul gave her what she needed. His aggressive strokes set her off in a rush.

"I'm right there with you," he groaned, driving powerfully into her. He made that sexy little noise that made her hot, a cross between a grunt and a hum that said more than words how much pleasure she gave him. "Right there... Right. There."

His gaze locked with hers as he came, the heady rush of pleasure shared between them.

"I love you," he grated, shaking with the force of his cli**x.

She couldn't look away, daring to believe.

* * *

Paul got her nak*d. Robin missed how he accomplished the feat while in her euphoric postcli**x haze, but she was grateful for the result. She lay curled against his side, her legs tangled with his. Her head lay on his chest, her fingertips tracing her name imprinted in his skin.

"I was going to f**k you and walk out," she confessed.

"I caught that." He pressed his lips to her forehead. "I wouldn't have let you leave. I would've followed you with my junk hanging out if I had to and hauled you back."

She lifted her head. "Like I'd ever let other women get an eyeful of you."

Paul smiled. "I'm all yours, honey. Flaws, baggage, and all."

Her hand stilled and settled over his heart. "You're not ready, Paul. I wish you were."

"The counselor I've been talking to says otherwise."

Robin's heartbeat skipped. "Counselor?"

He nodded. "I'll need to keep seeing him for a while, but I know enough about what losing Curt did to me to have my head on straight again."

Her heart ached for the tragedy he'd suffered. She couldn't imagine what it would feel like to outlive your child.

His fingers linked with hers. "I should have talked to someone a lot sooner, most especially after I started seeing you. It wasn't fair to you that I didn't."

"You can't take all the blame," she said softly. "When we started out, our arrangement was perfect for me, too. No strings, hot sex, and a guy who listened to me ramble on about jewelry. Things were fine until I changed my expectations."

He reached over with his free hand and opened the nightstand drawer. She thought he might be reaching for a condom, and her pulse quickened. Then a dark blue velvet box appeared in her line of vision, and her heart stopped altogether.

Paul set the box on his washboard abs and took a deep breath. "Do you have any idea how hard it is to buy an engagement ring for a jewelry designer who's kicked your ass to the curb?"

Unable to help herself, she reached for the box.

"Wait," he said, staying her. "Going back to the list of things I need from you... I need you to marry me, Robin. The next time we leave this room, I want us to come back to it as man and wife. I promise you'll have the wedding of your dreams, with our friends and family and doves and swans and whatever the hell you want, but I'd really like the vows now-today-and getting married here in Vegas feels like it fits us."

Us. She looked at him with wide eyes, her mind telling her how crazy that was. There were so many courtship steps they were skipping. What they'd had in their year together-not counting the four miserable months apart-was emails, phone calls, six days a month of the hottest sex of her life...

...and a sharp, pure feeling of connection that had hit them both like lightning the moment they'd laid eyes on each other.

"I know it's crazy," he said, reading her mind as he so often did. "But we've been crazy over each other from the start. I'm lovesick over you, baby. I swear you'll never regret taking a chance on me. I'll make you happier than you've ever been in your life."

Swallowing hard, she thumbed open the box.

"Oh, Paul," she breathed, her fingers shaking.

"Do you like it?" His rich, deep voice was laced with a rare note of anxiety. "We can exchange it if you don't. You can pick out whatever you want. Something more traditional maybe-"

"Shut up." The ring was perfect. It was unusual, almost quirky, with a massive diamond-around four carats was her educated guess-surrounded by irregular swirls of multisized rubies.

"When I look at it," he said quietly, "it reminds me of how I feel about you."

She saw that in the ring, too. The unusual design conveyed passionate chaos, and the fact that he registered that quality in the setting cemented her belief that he was the perfect man for her.

Climbing over him, Robin straddled his h*ps and extended her hand. "Put it on me."

The feel of the cool band sliding over her knuckle was so sublime it caused goose bumps to sweep across her skin. She wanted this so badly, wanted him. Her rough-edged brewmaster with his gentle hands and insatiable hunger for her body. The man who listened to her talk about gem clarity and design theory and who patiently explained the difference between lager and ale.

"Yes," she answered him, placing her hand on his chest next to her name over his heart.

Paul framed her ribcage with his hands, his thumbs stroking the lower curve of her br**sts. "And what do you need from me?"

"I needed this." She gestured between them. "A commitment from you. I'll also need a room that's mine alone, a workshop with lots of light and space."

"Done."

"And I need you to promise not to change your style for me."

His brows rose. "I have a style?"

"I love you just the way you are. Don't cut your hair or-"

He rolled abruptly, taking the top. "Say that again."

Laughing, Robin looked up into his impossibly handsome face. "Don't cut your hair?"

He snorted. "The part before that."

"Don't change your style?"

Bending his head, Paul caught her nipple between his teeth. She made a soft noise at the unexpected bite, then arched her back when his tongue soothed the slight sting. When his cheeks hollowed on a drawing pull, she moaned his name and gave him what he wanted.

"I love you, Paul. You're everything to me."

When he lifted his head, the fiercely tender look on his face was one she'd remember for the rest of her life.

Or she could just make him show it to her again. She had a lifetime to work on it.
