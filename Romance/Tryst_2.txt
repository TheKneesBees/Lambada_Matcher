NEW YORK, NEW YORK

6:48pm

The next night I can barely walk. I'm still sore all over, especially between the legs. Michael asked me to soak in a bath this morning and I did. It helped.

I set my case down backstage and look around for him. It's still early. I straighten my white blouse, checking the buttons. The nipple chain brushes against my shirtfront and sends sultry sensations between my legs. I pause, smoothing my skirt.

I'm facing the wall, when I feel his breath on my neck, "How are you feeling, Ashley?"

I don't turn around, "As good as can be expected." I glance at him over my shoulder, and he's grinning. My stomach twists as he looks at me.

He looks beautiful. A black tux clings to his body, showing off perfectly broad shoulders and a trim waist. "It's going to be so difficult to sit through the entire show. I get hard just looking at you," he breathes and leans into me. I feel his erection hard and ready against my ass.

A wicked smile runs across my lips, "Too bad." My entire body flares to life and heats with him so close.

"There's something you could do to tide me over. In fact, I think I'll make it mandatory." He's speaking softly when another cellist walks by. I smile at her as she moves to take her seat in the pit.

I glance at Michael, "Yeah? What's that?" I feel playful. I'm so happy to see him, so glad that he wants this as much as I do. I wonder if he'll tie me up again later and my stomach swirls with anticipation.

Michael thrusts his hand out, "Your panties. Give them to me." His dark brow rises as he extends his hand.

I hesitate and he says, "Sex slaves do what they're told. Don't make me punish you in front of all these people, Ashley. Hand them over."

My cheeks flame red. "Fine," I say. "I just didn't expect you to ask for them. You caught me by surprise is all." I start to walk to the ladies room to remove the tiny bottoms, but he grabs my arm.

"Do it here. Now." His eyes gleam. Michael leans against the wall and folds his arms over his chest, watching my reaction to his words.

I didn't think it was possible, but my face flares hotter, "I can't do that!" I hiss.

His lips pull into a crooked smile and he pushes off the wall. When he pulls back his hand, I realize he's going to spank me in front of everyone. I twist out of his reach before his hand comes down. I can't shimmy out of my panties fast enough. My thumbs hook the black lacy under my long skirt. I step out of them and press them into Michael's hand. He lifts them and presses them to his nose before looking up at me. A second later he places my panties in his tux pocket and leans in saying, "I'll punish you later. In the meantime, I'll watch you wrap your legs around that cello knowing how sore you are from last night and think about you sitting there with no panties in front of all these people."

Heat instantly pools between my legs. I press my thighs together and look him in the eye. If my skirt weren't so long, people could have seen that I was nak*d under the skirt. I nod once, and walk away, wondering what I've gotten myself into.

As we sit opposite each other, I watch Michael. He ignores me for the most part. I feel his eyes on me once in a while, usually when I feel how sore my ass is against the wooden chair. I wiggle, trying to make it feel better and find a comfortable spot. That's when I glance up at the conductor and see Michael's blue gaze. He watches me as he plays, his body swaying to the music. Everything about him consumes me and soon I find myself sliding my hand up and down my fingerboard, feeling the hard wood in my hands, and wishing it was him.

Thoughts like that flow through my mind and I can't stop them. Not wearing panties in a place like this makes me come alive. The thought of what he might do later consumes me. We play, each of us lost in our own world of lust until the end of the last song.

When the last note is played, I get up and walk toward me case. My stand-partner, James, is a tall thin man. He walks with me talking about something he saw on the subway. I nod like I'm paying attention, but I can't wait to wrap my legs around Michael. I just hope he'll let me. I'm not certain about what I offered, if I can actually do it. I like to be in control. I like things to be the way I want them, but that was what caused us to breakup. We both wanted control.

James continues talking, "It was unbelievable. You'd think the cello case was big enough that it wouldn't happen, right?"

I laugh, "Yeah. I know. Last night I was standing on line in the deli and almost smacked a few people in the face. You'd think they'd move."

"Ashley," Michael says behind me. I tense, feeling his eyes on my back. A shiver runs up my spine and pools between my legs in a delicious ache.

Slowly, I turn, "Michael. I'll be ready in a second."

Michael has his violin in the case and the case is already over his shoulder. He stands there with his hands in his pockets, watching me. Waiting.

James turns to him and offers his hand, "Hey. James Coffe." Michael takes his hand and shakes it. "You filling in for someone?"

Michael nods, "Yeah, Harvey's going to be out for a few days. Nothing serious." As he says it, his eyes are on me. It makes my stomach twist. I know he's thinking about what he wants to do to me when we get home.

"Good," James nods. He lifts his case and says, "Enjoy your night, Ashley. See you tomorrow."

I nod, knowing I'll enjoy every second of it.

Michael watches me and I realize that the stage is nearly empty. They shut down the house lights and it's grown quiet. Reaching for me, Michael takes me by the wrists and turns me toward him. His gaze is intense. It makes me shiver.

"Come with me," he says, his voice deep and commanding.

"What about my cello?" I ask.

He grins, "Perhaps we'll include it another time, but not right now. Leave it." He pulls my wrist and I walk away from my instrument and follow Michael backstage. He holds up a steel door that leads down to the prop room under the stage. Inky shadows absorb every bit of light down there. My pulse jumps a notch.

Michael ushers me through the door, and pulls it shut behind him, locking it. Silence fills the stairwell. We stand at the top of a metal landing. "Michael," I say nervously. "What are we doing?"

"No questions, Ash. Take my hand and come with me." He reaches out and his warm fingers intertwine with mine. It sends jolts of electricity up my arm. As we descend the staircase, I wonder if I'm insane. I trust him, but it seems like he is planning on hav**g s*x in a public place-a place where both of us work. I promised I wouldn't question him, so I don't. I bite my lip and follow him into the darkness.

"This is the bottom step. Careful," he says and helps me navigate the large room. A musty smell fills my nose. Michael stops and I feel his hands on my face. He pulls my mouth to his and kisses me like he'll die if he stops. It takes my breath away and I no longer worry about my abandoned cello upstairs or where the stage hands are. The only thought I have is Michael.

His lips press to mine as his tongue slides inside my mouth. It makes desire swim in my stomach. I lean into him, moaning. Before I know what happened, I feel his hand on my backside. The slap wasn't too hard, and it didn't sting very much through the skirt. "Quiet," he commands.

He kisses me harder, pressing my body against a wall. I can't see anything. I can only feel. I feel his body pressed to mine. I can feel the curve of his toned muscles and the heat wafting off his body. He presses into me, and I feel like I can't breathe. Every inch of me tingles and I want his hands on me, in me. Michael pulls away, and I feel disappointed.

A light shines in my face. I can't see him. "Unbutton your shirt," he commands.

Breathing hard, I find the first button and slide it through the hole. I repeat the action, heart pounding, wondering if anyone is going to come down here. Surly they can't be done cleaning for the night. The door could open at any second, but Michael doesn't seem to care. He stands in front of me perfectly calm, shining the light in my face so I can't see him. When I unbutton the third, he says, "Strip for me. All of it off. Now."

My heart races. I don't know how to strip. I open my mouth to tell him that, but he snaps his belt and I don't say it. "I still owe you a punishment, Ash. Don't make it more than you can bear."

I wish I could see him. I lower my head and continue opening buttons, swaying my h*ps while I do it. This seems to appease him. I want him to think I'm sexy. I want him to want me. When I open the last button, my shirt parts revealing my br**sts and a lace bra. I raise my hands over my head, and arch my back, sliding my hands back down my arms and over my br**sts as I look toward the light. The chain sways between my br**sts and tugs my n**ples as I do it. I purr and repeat the motion, sliding out of my shirt. The bra barely contains my br**sts. It's nothing more than a shelf to showcase my nipple rings. I feel Michael's eyes on me, although I can't see him. I make sexy soft sounds as I sway, running my hands over my curves for him. The situation has me so aroused that I can't ignore the heat between my legs, the steady pulsing that has grown hotter and hotter.

I slip out of the skirt and am wearing nothing but heels and the bra. Michael stops me. He comes into the light and wraps the chains in his fingers, gently tugging as he pulls my mouth down on his. I moan, falling into his arms, pressing my body against his.

Michael pulls away, breathing hard and takes his belt. He grabs my wrists and pulls them over my head, restraining them with his belt. My heart is crashing into my ribs. I suck in a deep breath, waiting for him to say something, but he doesn't. After he has me tied up, he lowers his head to my n**ples, and nips each one softly. I bite back the noise I want to make and he rewards me. His hand finds its way between my legs and strokes at my tender flesh. My h*ps remain still without him asking, knowing this is what he wants. His fingers dance between my lower lips, tugging and pinching my clit. He watches my face as he does it, trying to make me cry out. My lips part and my mouth opens, but I don't make a sound.

He purrs, "Good girl." And without any warning, slides two fingers into my p**sy. The movement shocks me and I move. Unable to do as he says, my h*ps slam into the pole to move away from his hand. In response, he pushes harder burying his fingers deep within me. I feel his hot breath on my neck, exhaling loud and hard as he does it.

I gasp realizing the mistake, saying, "I'm sorry. I didn't..." I want to please him. I want to do as he says. We set the rules and I broke one.

Before I can say anything else, I feel his punishment land across my ass. His fingers remain inside my p**sy as he does it. I clench in response, my p**sy tightening around his fingers, making him press harder. My mouth opens into an O. Pleasure and pain mix together and course through me. I want to scream, but I don't. I bite my lip and remain silent. Michael watches me as he does it. The dim light gives just enough glow that he can see me. And he likes to watch. His eyes narrow as his hand pushes harder into me. The look on his face is somewhere between lust and anger when his hand strikes my ass. He sees the expression on my face when his hand lands on my skin. He feels my damp heat tighten around his fingers. The silver chains swing between my br**sts.

I remain still and take my punishment, loving every second of it and craving more. Michael slides his fingers back, touching my cl*t as he splays his hands on my stomach, asking, "Where's the third chain tonight?"

I shrug, "I didn't wear it."

"Always wear it," he says and tugs the cl*t ring gently. A rush of air comes out of my mouth. My n**ples harden and I want him to touch me more, but he doesn't. He lets go of my cl*t and stands before me. Blue eyes rove over my body. They fill me with heat. Every pulse point in my body throbs, craving his touch.

Raising a finger to his lips, he inhales my scent on his hands and says, "We skipped one of your rules." Before I can answer, he slips the finger into his mouth and closes his eyes.

The movement is so sensual, so animalistic that I can't think. My mind is enveloped with a lusty haze. "What?" I breathe.

His eyes flick open, and he slips the finger out of his mouth. "I haven't told you where I want to come tonight. I thought that was a rule?" He stands before me, holding up another finger to my lips. He traces my mouth and I can smell my scent on his fingers.

"It is," I breathe. Before I can say anything else, he pushes his finger into my mouth and I suck. My tongue strokes his finger and he grins at me, slowly pulling his hand away like its filled with candy. He denies me another taste. I stand there panting, wanting him. The reaction I feel when he controls me like this is unparalleled. I pull against the belt.

His eyes slide over my body before he steps toward me again. His finger traces a line from my lips to my p**sy. I suck in as I try not to react to his touch, but it feels like every part of my body will make me come if he touches it. I can't stand it. I want him. I need him. I pull my wrists again and his eyes flick up above my head and back down to my face. He wraps my nipple chain around his fingers and yanks it hard. I gasp as he leans close, saying, "Last night I came in your p**sy, and while that was amazing, I think it might be fun to see what other things you excel at." He twists the chain as he speaks, his eyes locked on mine. My face contorts with pleasure that I can't hide. His voice is deep and dripping with sex, "I want to f**k your face, Ash. You're going to swallow my c*ck and suck me off. How does that sound?"

As soon as he says it I'm wetter. My pulse pounds inside of me, making me hotter. Every inch of my body is on fire and I can't deny him, "I'd like that."

He drops the chain and watches it bounce before saying, "Lower yourself." Confused, I hesitate. I was picturing his dick stroking my cheek and then thrusting into my mouth. I wanted to suck him and swallow his come. I'm frozen, unable to comprehend what he's doing.

Michael grabs a pillow, and turning his back to the pole, lies down. Taking the flashlight, he aims it up between my legs and smiles. His head is between my feet, looking up at my p**sy.

"Sit on my face, cello-girl," he commands, his voice terse.

My stomach flips. I can't sit on him chained to a pole in the middle of a basement. But I want to. I hedge, knowing it could end with a bigger punishment. "I thought I was going to swallow your dick?" My voice is breathy, like the idea appeals to me, because it does.

He smiles up at me, "You want that, don't you?" I nod, wanting it very much. My body pulses with the thought of tasting his c*ck in my mouth. My lips swell and I want him there between my lips, my tongue stroking his long hard shaft. Right now. He laughs, "In a second, Ashley. I want to taste you first. Sit on my face. Slide that perky ass toward my mouth and let me lick you." My heart pounds, but I can't move. I'm not sure, but I'm not supposed to think. I'm supposed to do what he says. His eyes narrow, "Do it or I'll punish you again."

I can't breathe. I want this. I chose this. I chose him and all the things we gave up. Our relationship is different now. We're different now. When we dated before, I would have never done this with him. The fact that I was nearly nak*d and tied to a pole didn't escape me either. Neither did the fact that I liked it-no I loved it and wanted more.

I want his lips on me, sucking my clit. I want him to eat me and taste me. The idea makes me wetter. Fighting the urge to pull my knees together, I lower my back against the pole, sliding down until I feel his lips on my p**sy. A burst of warm air rushes from his lips to mine. I can feel the warm, rich heat between my legs, the slow pulsing throb that hopes to become something more. The belt slid down the pole with me, keeping my hands tethered above my head. His tongue flicks the cl*t ring and sends convulsions through my body. I hesitate above him, not feeling brave enough to fall all the way to my knees and spread my legs the last little bit. I want to, but something stops me. Something tells me that I'm not this wanton woman, and that he's not this man. My heart is pounding, but I can't think. My body and my brain are at war.

Not giving me the option, Michael grabs my h*ps and pulls me down hard on his mouth. All thoughts cease as I bite back a moan, and close my eyes. His tongue moves inside me. Jutting in and out, he's tasting and licking every inch of my p**sy. His tongue traces the soft curves and licks the sensitive folds. Pressing deeper, Michael moves harder with his mouth. He takes big greedy licks of my p**sy, starting with his tongue on my ass and stroking me hard. He smiles as he does it. I can't see a thing. My br**sts tingle with every taste, every time his tongue takes another pass. My arms are burning from being over my head so long, but I don't care.

Shadows fill the space, and I can't see anything. Michael moved the light so that it shines on my p**sy in a narrow beam beneath me. Very little light seeps out from under me. A dim glow circles my bottom, just enough to tell that his face is under my ass. My heart pounds as his tounge works, darting and tasting me. Each pass becomes more vigorous, more demanding. His tongue dips deep into my p**sy and licks hard, stroking me. In response, I throw my head back. If my arms weren't tied to the pole, I would have fallen. I look at the landing above and see light spilling under the door. Someone is up there. My heart beats faster. I wonder if I should say something.

Between breathes, I whisper, "Someone's up there..."

The reply to my sudden outburst was a nip of my cl*t while his hands gripped my ass hard, forcing me deeper into his mouth. My body tenses, but I don't make another sound. The silver chain bounces, tugging my tender n**ples. I push back against the pole and close my eyes, enjoying what he's doing to me-how he's making me feel.

I start to rock, to shift with his movements, to feel him more, but he clamps my h*ps in place. His voice is muffled but I hear him perfectly, "Stay still, Ashley. Don't move." I whimper in response. His fingers dig into my h*ps and he holds me in place so I can't move. He's grinning. I can feel his beautiful smile beneath me. I nod and he releases my hips.

He starts again, slowly sliding his tongue over me, licking every inch of my wet skin. I tense to keep still, to remain silent. My breath comes harder and faster. My br**sts ache, dying for his touch. Suddenly, he yanks the chain that attaches to my n**ples. The shock makes me shriek. He quickly responds with his hands on my hips, pulling me closer to his lips. His teeth nip my cl*t harder this time. I bite back the sounds I want to make. I fight for control, and feel that I'm losing. As he releases me, I try to remain still. I try not to writhe against his face, but it's nearly impossible. The only way to fight the onslaught of sensations is to tense and try to not think about how he's making me feel.

When his teeth slide over my clit, he teases me more, sucking me harder and harder. His fingers thrust inside me, pushing deeper. My lower lip is caught between my teeth. I bite it hard to keep silent. My back is arched, trying to remain still, even though I want to ride his face. It takes every ounce of self-control to do as he says. I breathe slowly, feeling every sensation he sends through my body. Meanwhile, he's winding me tighter and tighter. I can't spread my legs far enough for him to kiss me as deeply as I want. I no longer care about the light upstairs or who might be up there, or what will happen if they find us. My stomach twists in beautiful knots. I want more. I need more. I need him to f**k me and never stop.

I beg him, "Fuck me, baby. Do it. Please."

But he doesn't. Instead, he holds me tightly to his face and eats me, until I nearly come in his mouth. Yanking the chain, he pulls my n**ples as he sucks my p**sy making me completely unable to sit still. Every inch of me is screaming out, needing to be sated. My body is so hot and completely covered in a thin sheen of sweat. My peek-a-boo bra is stuck to me like a second skin. When Michael finally pulls away, a rush of cool air hits between my legs. I fight back the sex sounds that I want to make as he sits up.

For a moment he does nothing. He just watches me and breathes hard. The intensity of his gaze nearly makes me come. I feel his eyes on me, burning into me through the darkness. Michael stands and pulls me up by tugging the chain on my br**sts. The pressure on my n**ples is so intense, but it only makes me want more. Through lowered lashes, I look up at him. He's already standing over me, and I'm still panting on the floor. I move quickly, getting to my feet. He drops the chain, and as it falls, I shudder and bite my lip.

He unties my hands and says, "Turn around."

My arms burn and I rub them as they fall to my sides. I do as he says and remain silent. My br**sts strain against my bra, n**ples taut. My legs are together, crossed at the ankle. I'm wringing my hands, wondering what he's going to do.

I feel his breathe behind me, his voice commanding in my ear, "Spread your legs."

I shiver when he speaks. My heart pounds harder, forcing blood to roar through me, making me hotter. A bead of sweat rolls down my spine. Michael's finger catches it before it disappears down the small of my back. He wraps that arm around me, showing me the drop. He puts his finger to my lips, still holding the bead of sweat, "Suck."

My lips move around his finger, licking the salty sweat off his hand. He pulls his finger from my mouth and dips it between my br**sts. They swell larger as I breathe harder. My body is practically vibrating, wishing he were inside of me. I shiver as he moves the sweat-covered finger to my lips again, opening my mouth, but he passes me and sucks his finger, wrapping his arm around my throat. When he's done, he lowers his hand so his arm isn't pressing into my neck as hard, but he still holds me against him.

I feel his dick slide against my back. He rubs against me, making the damp heat between my legs throb. He's breathing hard, his slick body hot and hard behind mine. Then he grabs my shoulders and steps back, separating us. He looks at me for a moment, circling me with his hand stroking his jaw. I breathe hard, looking straight ahead into shadows. His eyes burn a trail over my body. My chest is heaving as I try to control myself. My fingers clench by my sides, over and over again.

Finally he says, "On your knees." His hand smacks my ass hard and I fall to my knees. Before I look up, his dick is in front of my eyes.

I sit patiently waiting for him to tell me what to do. Instead, he grabs my hair on both sides of my head and pushes his dick into my mouth. When I move to wrap my fingers around him, he pulls away. "No. Keep your hands behind your back. Move again, and I'll tie you up."

He starts again, taking my hair and he thrusts deeper into my mouth. I suck him, working the long hard shaft with my tongue. Heat pools between my legs. I can't help it. The position, the way he grabs me, makes me want him more. He pulls out and wipes his dick across my cheek. The silky smooth skin is hot and leaves a trail across my face. I try hard to keep my hands behind my back, but I want to stroke him. I want to feel his erection in my hands and stroke his soft head.

Without warning, he's back inside my mouth. I taste his salty sweetness and take him in. He's developing a rhythm, pushing in shallow twice, then hard once. His body rocks as he does it. The light is on the floor, shining up at my body, just beneath my br**sts. Michael's eyes are on me, watching the bounce of my br**sts, the silver chains that sway with me, tugging on my sensitive parts. The taste of his dick, the way he fills my mouth, makes me so wet. The pulsating starts between my legs as I suck him, as I taste him. He pulls my hair harder, and I want more. I want him to push hard, faster. I intend to make him and move my hand.

But, when I reach for his dick, he pulls away suddenly. Before I can protest, he grabs me and pulls my over his lap and backs up on a bench. I'm lying across his lap; his dick is out of reach. His hand lands hard on my ass, stinging as he spanks me. I flinch as the burn spreads across my skin. "I said no touching." His hand comes up again, and he strikes me lower this time, stinging the bare skin between my legs.

The sensation shoots through my bottom and travels through my belly, making me wetter. He spanked my p**sy. I gasp and he ignores it. Instead, he thrusts his fingers into my p**sy, pushing deep inside of me. I bite my lip, loving it-wanting more. His other hand comes down again. I clench on contact. Tears sting my eyes, but I'm silent. The only sound he hears is a rush of air as his hand hits my p**sy.

"Good," he says and pulls his hand out from inside of me. "Do as I say, and I'll make you come, Ashley. I'll make you come deep and long." He turns me toward him, and looks at my eyes. He's wondering if he hit me too hard. In response I moan. He grins and shakes his head, realizing just how far I can go. He reaches around my back and unhooks my bra. My br**sts fall free and he carefully pulls my bra away from the chains. Turning me around, he ties it around my wrists. When he's done the underwire is cutting into my skin.

He commands me, "Kneel."

And we start again, but this time he teases me, rubbing his dick over my face, sliding it across my smooth skin, over my lips and eyes. I'm breathing hard. In my mind I'm begging him to f**k me. In reality, I'm silent. My ass still stings from his hand, and I clench deep inside thinking about it. I breathe hard as his dick slips over my cheek.

He traces my lips slowly, saying, "Don't move." My fingers wiggle behind my back as I think about touching him. I want to taste him. I can barely sit still, but I don't move. "Knees apart," he says and I spread my legs. The cool air rushes between stimulating me more.

After he traces my mouth, he grabs my long hair, and pushes his dick slowly past my lips. Gradually, he pulls out and pushes in again, going deeper this time. He slides back, sighing as he does it. His fingers tangle in my hair, and pull tighter this time. He's deeper, not worrying about hurting me. His dick slides past my lips and over my tongue, and doesn't stop until he hits the back of my throat. I breathe in sharply, taking him in my mouth, wanting him there. He moans, and leans his head back. He rocks, pushing into my lips harder and harder.

My br**sts bounce as he watches his dick disappear between my lips. I look up at him and take him, his whole dick again and again. His hard length starts to slide down my throat as he rocks. Sucking hard, I stroke him with my tongue while I lick. He moans, gripping my hair firmer, watching me. He's so incredibly hard, but he doesn't come. He controls himself, though I wish he wouldn't. He pushes me back.

I nearly whimper, I'm so disappointed. "Michael," I pant, "please."

He grins down at me, kneeling with my hands tied behind my back. "Please what? Tell me what you want baby. Tell me..."

Looking at the floor I say, "I want to suck you and swallow your come. I want you to f**k my face, baby. Please baby, f**k my face."

He tilts my chin up, "Beg for it. Beg until I give you what you want, Ash."

His touch sends currents through my body. I nearly die when he pulls his hand away. "Fuck my face, Michael. Pump into me. Push down my throat. Come in my mouth. I want to taste you. I want to swallow your come. I want to feel it slide down my throat. Please baby. Please, f**k my face. Please." I'm shaking, now. I can't control myself. I want him so badly. I have to taste him. My head lunges forward, but he steps back, out of my reach. My heart sinks, "Baby, please," I beg again and look up into his eyes ready to cry if he says no, "Fuck my face. Come in my mouth. Please, Michael. I need it. I want it. Please give it to me."

A soft smile lines his lips. My br**sts tingle as he steps toward me, brushing his dick against my cheek. I shiver, and want to take him in my mouth. "Stay perfectly still," he breathes. His hot skin continues to tease me, slipping across my cheek and then my eyes. Finally he lowers his dick to my lips and traces each one slowly with the tip of his cock. My body trembles as my wrists strain at the bra binding my hands together. The heat between my legs throbs. I need him. I want him.

I whimper, begging, "Baby, please."

And he loses control. His fingers tangle in my hair and he tilts my head back. "Watch me," he says.

My eyes are open and watching him slide his long hard shaft in and out. The carnal look in his eyes makes me hotter. My p**sy is so sensitive that I think I'll come. Michael pushes his dick over my lips and past my tongue. It slams into the back of my throat and I take in all of him, not stopping until the base of his c*ck is at my lips.

The hold on my hair tightens as I suck. I hear him sigh and see him hang his head back. Then he does it again. And again. His dick slips past my lips over and over and I let him bury it deep into my throat, sucking in every time he thrusts. I swallow and his lips form an O. I do it again, and feel him pulsing, knowing that his come will fill my mouth any second. A warm salty gush flows over my tongue and I suck and swallow, gently stroking him, working every last drop out of his cock. I don't stop licking and sucking when he's done, although I'm gentle. His hands remain in my hair, but he's petting me now, watching me suck him.

My p**sy is so hot and wet. I can't stop. I don't want to. When he pulls his dick out of my mouth, I nearly cry. But I don't have the chance. He pushes me onto my back, knocking the wind out of me. I fall onto my wrists and can't move. That's when I feel his lips between my legs. He licks me perfectly and then thrusts his tongue into my p**sy. His fingers tug my chain and I scream, coming in his mouth, rocking my h*ps as I do it. He drinks me in, savoring every last shudder.

When he's done, he gently rolls me over and unties my wrists. I'm on the cold floor. He scoops me up in his arms and holds me against him. His hands are in my hair, gently smoothing it against my head. "God, I missed you, Ash."

A sleepy warmth covers my entire body. I feel no shame for what I've done, though I feel I might tomorrow. "I missed you too," I say, liking the way he feels against me.

I have that warm glowing, happy feeling. We remain like that, holding each other for a while. When he releases me, he says, "Did I hurt you?"

I shake my head, and start pulling my clothes back on. I slide into the bra and carefully arrange the chains so they won't get caught and tug my n**ples. "No, I liked it."

He watches me with a lazy smile. The entire time, he wore most of his clothing. I realize that I didn't get to see him nak*d, although there was some thrill of being dominated by a man still wearing clothes. A man that I can't get enough of. I want to know what was next for us, but I was too afraid to ask.

I follow him up the stairs. When we emerge, it's dark. Whoever was here earlier, left. He picks up our instruments, and pulls the strap to my cello case onto his shoulder. "Come on," he says, "I'll walk you home. I can't have you famished and passing out on the subway or anything."

We walk down the streets and the night breeze lifts my hair. Michael walks next to me. I wonder what will happen to us. There is no way we can go back to what we had been, but I don't really see how this kind of relationship can endure much longer, although I want it to.

"Tomorrow's my last night filling in for Harvey," he says, looking at me out of the corner of his eye. I nod and look over at him. He looks so beautiful with that telltale sex afterglow. I wonder if I look like that and push the hair out of my face.

"Maybe we should make a night of it," I say, assuming he's telling me good-bye.

We stop in front of my building. He sets down the cello and says, "Sounds good."

I pause, and then ask, "Maybe we should try something new?"

He grins at me. It's that lopsided grin that makes me melt. "What'd you have in mind, Ashley?" His eyes travel up and down my body.

"You decide," I smile coyly from beneath my lashes, suddenly looking forward to tomorrow much more than I was a few seconds ago. I wonder what he wants from me, if this will be the last time I see him. I don't want to ruin the moment and mention it. At the same time, life without him seems empty. My heart twists. I hide the thoughts weighing on me and say, "Maybe try some place new to eat..."

He shakes his head, "No. There is no way I'm spending my last night with you eating some place weird. No, Ash. I know exactly what I want. In fact, I'll tell you now." He leans in close and whispers in my ear, "Tomorrow night I want to come in your ass."
