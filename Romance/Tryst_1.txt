NEW YORK, NEW YORK

8:06pm

A black skirt is draped over my knees; a shiny cello rests in between. My dark hair is pulled away from my face into a tight chignon at the base of my neck. Pressing firmly on the metal strings, my fingers glide over the ebony fingerboard. My wrist slides my bow across the cello. It makes a melancholy sound that feels like it's being torn from my heart and projected through the wood. My stomach is twisting over and over again. I know this music by heart. I know my part. I know what to expect from the orchestra playing in the shadows of the stage that surround me. But him. He's not supposed to be here.

I swallow hard, glancing up at him when he isn't looking. His has dark hair falls into his eyes as he plays. That violin-the one I remember-it's pressed to his neck, leaning softly against his broad shoulder. He looks too rugged to be playing such a delicate instrument. I'd always thought so, but he plays like his muse lives within the wood of that violin. His bright blue eyes are closed as he sways to the music.

Suddenly, I catch him glancing at me from over his music stand. Golden light spills over his face highlighting the angles of his cheeks. He looks from under those dark lashes with those piercing eyes, and I can't breathe. I'm caught in his snare. He peers over the top of his violin at me as he plays. The conductor stands between us swaying his arms, prompting the other musicians, keeping us in sync with the people on the stage.

Continuing to slide my bow across the strings, I play. Every second that ticks by feels like eternity. I think about what I'll say to him after work is done, after we've packed our instruments into their black cases. Courage locks my eyes with his. Our gazes burn in the shadows of the stage, our eyes speak words neither of us has the courage to say-words that have gone unspoken too long. If I could take everything back, I would. If there was a way to start over, to show him how much I missed him, I'd take it. My heart races faster. I slide my fingers slowly over the neck of my cello. Each note plays like a gentle caress, and I wish that I could touch him so softly one last time.

As we play, his eyes remain locked on mine. Regret pours through my heart and pumps through my body. Although I'm surrounded by music, I don't hear it. Instead, I hear our last words-the exasperation in his voice. The sharp pain shoots through me again, but it's dulled by time and remorse.

I had let him leave. I had let him walk away without an explanation. Without a word.

The conductor turns toward my section, prompting us with a wave of his hand to play louder. I break our gaze and feel the pit of my stomach sink, and play as I'm commanded. The music floods my soul and spreads through every inch of me. My body rocks gently as I grip the cello tighter with my knees, holding it in place. My fingers dance down the fingerboard in long slow strokes, rocking to make the sound resonate. It spreads to the people sitting in their seats who are diligently watching the actors on the stage above us.

I concentrate, trying to force him out of my mind, trying to push out the sound of his voice and the memories of his laughter. I play on and he doesn't look up at me again. We're two people that are so close together, but we are still so far apart. It feels like someone is squeezing my heart. My body flushes and heat snakes up from deep within my belly. It tastes bitter, like so many things needlessly lost. That's what he is. That is what he represents-everything that could have been-the life I threw away when I let him go.

I can't stand it anymore. For the past three years, I've been living my life in 'what-if' mode, wondering. I'm always wondering what if I did this differently, what if I kissed him, what if I told him what I wanted? What if...? I asked myself these questions until there were no questions left to ask. The answer was always the same-I'll never know-not unless he crosses my path again.

Swallowing hard, I look up at him. His eyes are lowered, sliding across the music on the stand in front of him. Michael crossed my path again. It was fate, luck, or destiny, but whatever you want to call it-it meant the same thing-I have a second chance. Hope filled my chest, as I realized what I wanted to do. As soon as this show is over, I'm going to talk to him. At the very least, I want to see that he's all right, but my stomach twists hoping for more, hoping that he still feels something for me.

After the last note is played, I feel a rush wash over me. I'm nervous. My body shakes when we are dismissed. Rising, I take my cello backstage and pack it up. Michael is behind me. I feel his eyes on my back. I take a deep breath and place my cello in the case, and stow my bow. Pressing my lips together anxiously, I turn around. The small space is crammed full of people wearing black and white, putting away shiny instruments, but Michael isn't there. He's gone. My gaze falls to the floor as all the hope drains from my body. Throwing the strap across my shoulder, I lift my case and walk out of the theatre and down the street into the balmy night.

It's hotter than usual. Tugging the cello home tonight ensures I'll be covered in sweat. I unbutton my collar revealing a choker and delicate silver chains that disappear beneath. I think back to the last time I saw him and realize that I'm not the same girl anymore. He saw it in me, but I denied it. I thought I had to be something else-someone else. I didn't understand then, but I do now.

Dread fills my legs, making them feel like lead. I walk slowly, shouldering my way between people on the sidewalks. I feel eyes on me, but when I turn to look I don't see who it was. There are always people in the city. It doesn't matter what time it is. I run my hand over my neck, smoothing my skin. Ignoring the sensation, I walk on. Neon signs blaze around me in a kaleidoscope of color, blinking reds, greens, and blues on my pale skin. My face is a blank mask. I look at everyone, and see no one. I just want to go home, but I'm so hungry.

My feet slow as I walk past a deli. At the last second I turn and head back for the door, nearly knocking a few people over in the process. My cello case is clutched to my shoulder like a purse. I pull it closer to my body to avoid giving someone a concussion. I push through the door and get on line. As I'm scanning the menu, thinking about what to order, I feel that tickle on the back of my neck again. My hand flies to the spot and I turn slowly.

When our eyes meet, my breath catches in my throat.

"Ashley," he breathes. Michael is standing behind me, his blue eyes pinning me in place. My jaw opens, but I can't speak. It feels like time stopped and the world is floating away. My skin pebbles with goosebumps and I shiver like I'm cold. "I saw you come in and I thought-" his voice trails off as his dark lashes lower, breaking our gaze.

He was always so shy, but I loved that about him. I loved him. I don't answer. I can't speak. It feels like I swallowed a bag of sand. I just stand there staring at him.

He glances up again, "I thought that we could talk, but that seems to be a bad idea-" He turns to leave and my heart-rate spikes. I reach for him, wrapping my fingers around his strong forearm.

"Wait. I-" my voice quivers. I mentally slap myself in the face. Stop it! Just say it! Say what you practiced over and over again. Just say it! He looks down at my hand and back up at my face. My eyes remain lowered, fixated on the violin case in his other hand. "I'd like that... " I look up at him from under dark lashes, "and maybe more."

His eyebrows lift slightly, "More?"

I can't look at him, but I force myself to meet his gaze. My heart is pounding in my chest. I want this. I want him. I feel it in every inch of my body. "I want you. Talking would never be enough." Suddenly I find the words that I'd practiced so many times. They pour out of my mouth, "I shouldn't have let you walk away. Every horrible moment of that day is etched into my mind and replays over and over again. It's caught in an endless loop, watching you leave, watching me say nothing." My voice fades. I lick my lips and say, "It was the stupidest thing I've ever done. You're everything to me. You always will be. If I'm too late now, it's my own damn fault." He tries to talk, but I raise my hands, and speak over him, shaking my head, "I had to tell you. I had to say it. I can't live my life wondering what if anymore." I pause, my lips parted, not knowing what else to say. I lift my hand to his face, wanting to kiss him, wanting to hold him, but I don't dare. I don't want to be that girl, the one who takes another woman's man, if he moved on. Tearing my fingers away, I turn to leave, but his hand shoots up and grabs my wrist.

Big blue eyes look back at me, like he can't believe what's happening. Suddenly his hand feels much stronger, much hotter. "I never stopped wondering what would happen if I saw you again, what I could say that might make things right." A thin sheen of sweat covers his face.

My entire body feels like it is on fire. I want to be in his arms. "Why don't we see-come back to my place with me," my voice is deep, seductive. My fingers slide down his cheeks, our gazes locked. He nods, unable to speak. He knows what I'm offering, what I couldn't admit before. He sees it in my face. We leave the deli and he grips my hand tightly, walking down the street. I'm no longer hungry. I only want him. I want the things we couldn't agree on before. My heart races faster.

Michael speaks softly, hesitantly, "We don't have to do this tonight. Seeing you is enough. Ashley-"

I cut him off. I had plenty of time to think about this. I know what I want; I know how I want things to be. I rub the side of his hand with my thumb, "No, I want to do this. I want to be with you. Micahel, please." We stop and I look at him.

His hand touches my cheek gently and he leans in. Our lips meet, and softly-carefully-he kisses me. When he pulls away, he nods, "I won't hold back."

I blush, staring at the ground and say, "Good, because I'll do anything you want. Anything..." The word hangs between us. My pulse pounds harder. "I just want one thing, before we start-you have to choose where you want to come." I sound confident, like I have this conversation all the time. The only thing that gives me away is the rush of red that flows to my cheeks. We get some looks as the people standing next to us pass. They heard me.

Michael pushes his hair out of his eyes. Shock lines his face. There's a softness to him that makes him seem vulnerable. It makes me want him more. I feel reckless and it makes me more confident than I am. "What are my options?"

A wicked grin twists my smile into a sultry expression. I lean in and whisper, "Anywhere. My p**sy, ass, or mouth. You pick. And telling me first is a rule tonight. You break it, you pay." His mouth forms a small O as I speak, his blue eyes are locked on mine. I touch his lips with my forefinger. He blinks and looks down.

He nods, "Any other rules?"

"No apologies. No questions." This is the end of our previous relationship. I know that whatever happens tonight will permanently change things.

He follows me home. We climb the stairs to the second floor. Tension lines his shoulders. I know how shy he is, how hard this will be for him. After turning the key in the lock, I open the door. Michael walks in front of me and places his violin case next to the door. I follow him and set down the cello before taking his hand and leading him back into my bedroom. He loosens his tie, but doesn't take it off. It hangs around his neck.

Slipping my shoes off, I say, "I was serious before. We can do anything you want. I'm not the same girl anymore." He eyes me, watching the choker under my shirt. His eyes follow the delicate chains that disappear beneath my cl**vage.

"Is that...?"

Lips parted, I say nothing. I just nod, and feel my n**ples harden. His gaze remains fixed on the chains as I unbutton my shirt, and reveal the shelf-bra underneath. It holds my br**sts perfectly, showing their fullness and allows me to wear the jewelry. It can't be seen under my blouse. It was a fluke I wore it tonight. I wanted to feel sexy when I left, and now I feel like a goddess. Michael doesn't seem to breathe as he watches in disbelief. As my blouse parts, he sees the necklace is a silver collar. It connects with two delicate chains that connect to nipple rings, and a third chain that disappears beneath my skirt. I tie the shirt at the waist leaving the top unbuttoned so he can see my br**sts and the chain that connects to each nipple from my collar.

"You pierced them," he whispers, his gaze locked on my n**ples. My br**sts swell as he stares at me. I nod. "When?" he asks and lifts his face to mine.

"A long time ago," I say gently. "You can pull them, suck them, and do anything you like." I lick my lips, and look at him through lowered lashes. "There are only two rules, remember? No questions. And you have to choose how you'll fill me with come before we start." My voice is softer than I'd intended. I didn't know the piercing would have such an effect on him. "Well?" I prod.

"I'll come in your p**sy, Ashley" he says shyly.

I put my hands on his chest, sliding off his dark blue jacket, telling him what I want, what I need. "Say it like you own me, because you do. I'll do anything you want. Do you understand what that means?"

He looks around at the room. His dark brow lifts, "Anything?"

I nod, running my fingers along his shirt. "Anything," I breathe.

He swallows hard, and tugs me toward him, pulling me by the waist. His lips hover above mine, hesitantly. I know he's thinking of the way things were before-about the things that drove us apart. Without another word his lips come crashing down on mine. It's a desperate kiss as his tongue forces its way into my mouth. He licks me, stroking my mouth as he kisses me, tasting me. He's so hard. Every inch of his dick presses firmly against my stomach, and I want him inside me. But I let him go at his own pace.

Breathless, he pulls away, "Where does the third one go?" he asks, touching the delicate silver, pressing his finger over the chain and sliding his hand down my body.

I answer by untying the knot around my waist and peeling off the shirt. My skin is slick. His eyes are on me, on the white bra that holds my n**ples out to him. Michael reaches for my skirt, his strong hands press me closely to his chest, as his fingers search for the zipper in back. Teasing the zipper down, he slides his hands over my butt, cupping my ass and pulling me harder against his erection.

Holding me there for a moment, he strokes the small of my back and breathes in deeply. I savor his scent and the way he feels pressed against me. His hands tug the skirt down over the swell of my hips, and the skirt falls to the floor. I step out of it. I'm wearing a tiny panty, made from a patch of lace and three pieces of string. Confidence is flowing through my body. As he gazes at me, I spread my legs and look at him.

His eyes are locked on the third chain that goes to the bare skin below my waist and disappears beneath the lace. He's breathing hard. "The third chain is attached to ...?" He swallows hard and looks up at me.

I lean into him, splaying my fingers on his chest, whispering, "My clit. I'm yours. Take me. Spank me. Fuck my face. I'm your wildest wet dream, and I'll do anything you want."

He looks down at me. Caution flashes in his eyes, but quickly vanishes. He wonders what came over me, what made me change. I know he wants to ask, but he promised he wouldn't. I want to tell him, but I won't. Not yet.

He leans his forehead against mine and whispers, "You've always been my wet dream, Ash." His eyes move around the room. It's pretty much the same as when he was here last. A bed, a dresser, and the support post from hell that stands in the middle of the room, uglying it up.

Michael grabs my wrist hard and pulls me toward the thick post. "Feet apart," he tells me.

I do as he says. The tone of his voice is perfect. I wish he'd talk like that the entire time. He takes his belt off, and snaps it. I flinch, wondering if he's going to strike me, but he says, "Hands above your head."

I lift my hands and he places the belt around them, using it to hold me in place. When he's done, he steps back and looks at me, his eyes slipping hungrily over my curves. His gaze lingers on the patch of lace. He kneels in front of me, and slowly slides his hands up the back of my thighs, pressing my p**sy against his face as he does it. When his hands move over the swell of my hips, he inhales deeply, and his fingers wrap around the white strings. He tugs them down, stripping my lower half. He tosses the panty aside and gazes at me, touching my smooth skin gently. With his fingers, he outlines the silver chain that disappears between my lower lips.

I press my back against the pole and moan. My feet start to move back together to clench the warmth building between my thighs, but he swats me and says, "Feet apart."

With a grin on his face, he stands. Michael unbuttons his pants, slowly sliding down the zipper. He keeps the dark pants on, and pulls out his long, thick erection. He hesitates, stopping before me, holding it in his hand. I know he's questioning himself. The conflict spreads across his face.

"Do it," I plead, hanging my head back and letting my hair trail down to my waist. I know his eyes are on me, watching my body move in front of him, tied up and ready to take. I'm breathing hard, wanting him to do it. When a moment passes, I look at him and say, "Take me right now and make me yours in every way possible. Do it. No more regrets. No more wondering. Do it. Take me."

"I don't want to hurt you," he says, his eyes on mine.

"Then don't," I breathe. "You're the one in control here. Make me writhe. Make me scream. Make me yours. Take me the way you want to. But, Michael-"

"Yeah?"

"I like things a little rough." After I say it, my lips remain parted and I take a deep breath. My chest swells, forcing my n**ples toward him. The pole presses against my back and I lean into it wondering what he'll do.

Michael takes my face in his hands. "Tell me if I hurt you. Promise. As soon as you don't like it anymore, you'll tell me." I nod slowly, his warm hands still holding my cheeks.

It was like someone flipped a switch. Michael's eyes grow darker, more carnal. He releases my face and presses his tone body against me. Pushing my back into the pole, he makes sure I can feel every inch of him. The nipple chains go taught and pull gently as he slides over me. A small gasp escapes between my lips. Michael watches me, his blue eyes locked on mine. He takes one finger and places it on my pink lips, while his other hand slides lower past my belly and between my legs. I gasp. He moves quickly, feeling the cl*t ring under his touch, watching my face as he does it.

My chin lifts as I try to not to moan. I fight the sensations that are erupting inside of me, the feelings he's creating. His fingers move on top of my clit, tugging the chain gently. He feels me growing wetter and then, without warning-without a change in expression-he thrusts his finger inside of me. He's still for a moment, watching my eyes. I blink slowly, feeling him there between my legs. The last time we were together, I was smooth. Nothing was pierced. There were no chains.

Michael pushes his finger harder, deeper as he watches my eyes. His breath washes over my lips making me feel light. When he pulls his finger out, he lifts it to my mouth. Outlining my lips, he watches me and spreads my damp heat like lip balm. I blink slowly, my heart pounding.

"Taste how good you are," he breathes and pushes his finger into my mouth. I flick my tongue against his finger, but he holds it there and says, "Suck the come off your finger, Ashley." I hesitate, but he says, "Do it," and I do. My tongue wraps around his finger, sucking it, tasting what he tastes. His eyes are burning, watching me.

As I suck his finger, he lowers his other hand between my legs, parting my smooth skin. Sensations explode inside of me, but before I can savor them, the feeling changes. Michael's dick slams into me, making me suck his finger harder. He pulls his finger out of my mouth, and wraps his hands around my waist. He remains still for a moment, breathing heavily. Then he pulls his dick out slowly and thrusts it back in, slamming me into the pole. My knees tremble. I want more. He pulls out and slams back in hard.

I gasp every time. My br**sts shake with the force of his thrust. Something uncoils inside of me. I want his hands on me, doing things we haven't done. I crave it so badly, I always have. And he knew, even then. It was me who denied how I was, that I wanted to be dominated, but he knew. And now that he was acting on it, now that I'd accepted it, I felt so much more. Delicate strands of passion erupted inside of me, sending tingles down my thighs and br**sts. Every place I wanted him to touch sizzles like a current runs through me. Arching my back, I pressed my h*ps into him, only to get slammed back into the pole.

His thrusts change to teases, gently pushing in and pulling out. His dick is so hard, so sharp. I want to wrap my legs around his hips, but I can't. Breathing hard, I look up at the ceiling. That's when his hands find my br**sts. My lips form an O, but I say nothing. He feels the softness, the fullness of my curves as he pushes his long, hard length into me slowly, torturing me, over and over again.

Taking my n**ples between his fingers, he twists them gently. I cry out, thrusting my br**sts to him, but the pole stops me. Gasping, I can barely breath.

He grins, "Shhh. No sounds from you."

I can't breathe. I do as he says and bite my lip to remain silent. He slams his dick into me again, and my mouth flies open. I swallow the sound before he hears it. The only noise is a rush of air being forced out of my lungs.

"Good girl," he purrs and pulls out before thrusting back in, deeper this time. The tone of his voice makes me shiver. The way he said it makes me think he's really okay with this, with us. It's not that I expected him to protest, it's just that this isn't what we used to do.

Before I could think another thing, Michael's fingers clamp around my n**ples. His h*ps stay pressed flush to mine, his length lost inside of me. My jaw falls open, and I see him watching me, waiting for me to make a noise. My eyes lock on his, while sinful sensations swirl through my body, building tighter and higher. He slowly adds more pressure, teasing and pulling my n**ples tighter and longer. The heat in my stomach sears through my body. It makes me shift my h*ps and try to f**k him, but he stills me.

"No, no. Not yet baby. I'll tell you when to push back. If you do it before then, I'll spank you."

I push back. Eyes gleaming, I say, "I like to be spanked."

His hand comes down hard on my ass. Both cheeks sting. He does it while he's still in me. It makes me clench and my p**sy tightens around his dick. He gasps and does it again, harder. The impact of his hands feels so good that my p**sy clenches his dick harder. The warm sting of his hand sends shudders through me. They travel through my lower stomach and spread through my entire body. Every declicious tingle courses through me, making me slide my tounge over my teeth. I do it without thinking. It's a reaction to him, to what he's doing to me.

Without warning, Michael pulls out. It makes me crazy. My h*ps buck, but I can't reach him. The belt cuts into my wrists as I pull against my restraints. I pant, watching him as he moves away from me. Lust is burning through my body. I can't control myself. Pulling my wrists hard, I try to break free from the belt again, but I can't.

He grins, watching me struggle, until I stop and look up at him. The expression on his face, the intensity of his eyes, makes my stomach flip. My breath hitches in my throat. Michael steps close enough to touch me, but he doesn't. I'm panting. My eyes are begging him to do something-to make me come, to let me f**k him-anything.

"Tell me what you want, Ash. Beg me for it," he breathes the words next to my ear. The reaction within me is quick and violent. His warm breath makes my cl*t throb and it feels like I'll die if he doesn't touch me, if he doesn't finish what he started. He stands so close, nearly touching me, but doesn't slide his fingers down my waist. He doesn't touch my breast and tease my n**ples. It makes me want him even more. I feel like a chained animal, unable to think. "Answer," he commands and I feel the sting of his hand on my ass.

My body is so tightly coiled that the slap makes me moan. I didn't expect it, but before I could bite back my sounds, they flew past my lips. I gasp, shocked that I wasn't able to muffle the noise or stop it in time. Michael's hand flies a second time, harder. He watches my face as I wince under his hand. The sting is harder, and I know that I'm going to have a problem playing my cello on the hard wooden chair tomorrow night, but I don't care. I cry out, saying his name, thrusting my br**sts toward him.

A wicked look twists his lips into a sexy smile, "Answer me." His voice sounds like a growl and when I can't do anything but pant uncontrollably, his hand lands a third time. But he doesn't release me. Instead he grabs my cheek in his hand and squeezes. The sting intensifies from the way he grabs me. Michael's beautiful body is covered in a thin sheen of sweat, as he handles me roughly. "Tell me what you want."

My voice is a breath. Every desire races out in a rush, "I want your hands on me, in me. I want you to f**k me senseless until I can't walk."

"Beg for it, Ash. Beg me to f**k your senseless," his grip tightens on my ass making my body press into his. A bead of sweat rolls down my spine.

My voice quivers as I beg him, no longer capable of maintaining any ounce of restraint, "Please, Michael-please. Fuck me. Fuck my p**sy. Fill me with come. Please baby. Please..." I continue to beg him, as he his hands slide over my h*ps and down between my legs. When he touches my cl*t I moan. Michael leans his head back, watching me. "Fuck me, baby. Please." My h*ps buck into his hand. In response, he tightens his fingers on my clit. I cry out, "Fuck me! Please! Michael!"

When I say his name, he shatters. Before I know what happens, his hands are holding my wrists the pole over my head and his dick slams into my p**sy. He thrusts into me hard and deep over and over again. His hands slide down my arms as he thrusts into me, watching my br**sts bounce with each slam of his body. Pushing harder and harder, he watches them sway and bounce until he takes both in his hands and pinches my n**ples hard. I scream out, but it only makes him pinch harder.

His dick slams into me faster and faster. The heat between my legs is coursing through my body. It feels like I can't be tamed. There isn't enough of him to ever satisfy me. When his fingers clamp harder on my n**ples, my eyes fly open. He looks me in the eye as he thrusts into me once-hard. My back hits the pole and he holds me there, watching me. Lips parted, he breathes saying nothing. His hands gently push the hair back from my eyes. He stills for a moment and I can't stand it. His dick is in my p**sy and no matter how much I wiggle, I can't get him to f**k me.

With his entire body, he flattens me against the pole. His eye burn with lust, his brow drips with sweat. "Come for me, baby," he breathes and pounds into me fast and furious. He doesn't stop when I scream, he keeps pounding against me until my body can't wind any tighter. Each time he sinks into me I feel higher and higher. I can't breathe, but I don't want him to stop. His body crushes me to the pole, as his dick slams into me again. He feels so sharp, so hard. I moan, and can tell how hard he's pushing, how much I'm going to hurt later, but I don't care. In the moment, it feels so good. My skin tingles and is slick with sweat. My br**sts bounce harder and higher with every slam of his dick. He's everything I want, everything I need. And without another thought, I come. My scream rips through my throat. I can't come quietly, not when he does this. Michael pounds me harder as the delicious swirling sensations erupt throughout my body. I feel him push into me hard and deep, and he comes a few moments later.

Spent, I hang from the pole shivering. Michael pulls away, breathless and looks me over. Lips parted, he just stares at me for a moment before undoing the belt. When my hands fall to my sides, my arms burn. Michael takes me in his arms and carries me to the bench. He sits me down in front of him and rubs out the sore muscles in my arms and shoulders. My head droops to the side as he does it. Every inch of me is tingling. I don't want the moment to end, but Michael stops.

He says, "We've both changed, Ash." I turn and look at him. He's glowing, covered in a thin layer of sweat. I want to lick it off, but I just nod. He turns his big blue eyes away and says, "I guess I should get going."

"You're leaving?" I ask, crestfallen. Suddenly I feel very nak*d, and pull the throw blanket off the bed and wrap it around my shoulders.

He nods, "This was a one-time thing, Ashley." He gets dressed, slowly like he wants me to say something, but I don't know what to say.

Finally, I ask, "Does it have to be?"

"What do you mean?" he sounds interested.

I twist my hands and look up at him, "This was the reason we broke up-"

He nods, "But you said no questions, so I didn't ask."

"I know," I say, "so let's see where this goes. That's safe enough, isn't it?"

He watches me, his gaze sliding over my body and I can't help but feel that he'd f**k me again right then if I asked him to. Part of me wanted more than that though. I want him to take me, to turn me around, and do what he wants. I swallow hard thinking about it. "You want me to act like I own you? Like you're my little sex slave?"

I nod, "Yeah. That's exactly what I'm asking." I stand and walk in front of him. His shirt is unbuttoned, untucked. I slide my hands under the hem and tug at his waist. "You up for it?"

He laughs, "Ashley, you have no idea what you do to me." Grinning at me, he leans in and kisses me hard. When he releases me I gasp, and stumble back. His hands steady me. He lifts my chin and I look into his eyes, "Tomorrow night, this starts at work-as soon as I see you. You're mine. You do as I say, no questions asked."

I smile up at him and wonder if I'm really ready for this. I have no idea what he has in mind or what he wants to do, but I can see the knowing look in his eye that tells me he already has plans for us. "I can handle anything you dish out." A sexy grin spreads across my lips.

Michael takes me in his arms and kisses me hard. When he releases me, he says, "I look forward to it."
