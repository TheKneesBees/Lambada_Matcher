"You should totally go, Lacey."

I sighed and threw Alma a look that could kill. "I don't know, Alms. It's not really my scene."

"Who cares? You're my friend. I don't have a date, and I want you to go with me." She grinned at me and shimmied into her tenth red dress of the day.

"Alright, but you're the one who wanted to bring along an unemployed loser. Wasn't my idea. Just remember that."

Alma rolled her eyes. "Whatever. Soon to be employed. It's just a downturn, a run of bad luck. That's all."

"Yeah. I guess." I wasn't convinced. My bookkeeping skills were up to par, but my company had downsized and out I went. I was just another Millenial brat in need of a good job.

"Oh, hey. Do you have something to wear tonight?" Alma's brow scrunched, and she scrutinized me. The shopping trip had been all about her, and I was fine with that. Clothes didn't interest me much.

"Yeah. I have a little black number that will do just fine." It was one I'd worn a hundred times before, but what did it matter? I couldn't afford a new one. I was watching every penny these days.

"Good. I'll be by to pick you up at 7:00. I'm getting this one. Let's go." Alma jerked her head toward the door, red dress in tow.

I slunk out of the dressing room behind her, tucking my hair behind my ears. The mirror had told me all I wanted to know about how I was looking three months after the layoff. Same shiny long brown hair, worried blue eyes, no smile.

"Cheer up, Lacey. It's going to be fine. I swear. Tonight will be fun. Open bar and all that. You can't lose." Alma grabbed my arm, and I let her steer me to the car.

At least I could drink my troubles away.

* * * *

"Oh my god, it's crowded in here." I struggled against the press of people at the mansion.

"Well, it's Rock Weldon's place. What do you expect?"

I yawned. "Who's that?"

Alma rolled her eyes as she always does when I say something she thinks is unbelievable or stupid. "I can't believe you sometimes, you know that?"

I shrugged and grabbed a glass of champagne from the nearest waiter. We'd made our way into beyond the foyer.

"He's the head of Regal Enterprises. You know, he's at the top of the food chain where I work. The CEO, the big cheese and so on."

"Oh, I see."

"I've only seen him in photos. I'm just an editor. You know how it goes." Alma shrugged.

"I guess."

"Oh, there's my manager. I need to speak to him." Alma hurried away.

"Dont...leave me," I said and sighed. She'd already gone and was nothing more than a dot in a sea of dresses and tuxes. I glanced up at the shimmering chandelier. The place was gorgeous, but all I wanted to do was find a corner to hide in for a while with my drink.

A plate of shrimp sailed by via a waiter, and I plucked a few of those and started plotting my escape from the crowd.

I could see a staircase and beyond it, a French door. Air. I needed air.

I raced toward it, cursing my three-inch heels. I threw it open and found myself alone on an ornate stone balcony of sorts. The city lay before me. I gulped in oxygen, fighting back tears.

At twenty-five I felt washed up, that only a desert of regret and missed opportunities lay before me.

"Hello. You must be the new intern."

Through the haze of my tears, I slowly turned. I wiped at my eyes and forced a smile. Then my heart stopped for an instant.

I had seen this man before on magazine covers. Rock Weldon in the flesh.

Now I remembered who he was-the owner of this place. His hair gleamed dark and slick in the light, his jaw strong. The most arresting feature about him, though, was his eyes. I could tell they were clear greenish even in the tepid moonlight.

"Uh."

I couldn't force anything else out. I just stood there with my mouth hanging open like an idiot, staring at him.

He cocked his head, lifting an eyebrow. I noticed his perfect body-lean and hard in all the right places. The tux he was wearing didn't hurt. It must have cost more than my whole year's salary had.

"Miss Phelps?"

"I think there's been-"

He held a hand up. "You're the woman for the job." His voice was a low growl now, and he stepped closer to me.

I moved into the shadows, my heart pounding so fast I thought my chest would explode. "But I'm not Ms. Phelps." I choked the words out.

"Doesn't matter. You're the one I want, and I think you'll find that when I want something, I get it."

"Oh."

He pulled me behind a palm tree I hadn't even noticed. We were in near darkness now. The only sound was my breathing.

I wanted him to touch me, to do whatever he wanted to do with me. I'd never had a feeling like that about a man, especially one I didn't know. He exuded power and know how in a way I'd rarely seen from anyone.

"Mr. Weldon?" A voice called from the doorway.

"What?" He ground the word out, glaring. He stood just inches from me.

"They need you for the introduction."

"Dammit. I'm coming. I'll be there in a second."

"Alright, sir." The voice was meek now.

The sound of the door shutting allowed me to breathe again.

"What's your line of work?" He crossed his arms, staring me down.

"Bookkeeping," I managed to squeak out.

"Perfect. That's all I needed to know. That's just the beginning of your duties for me." As he spoke, he bit his lip, and his gaze traveled the length of my body and back up.

I shivered in the warm night air.

"I have to go. Meet me here at midnight. No excuses." He whirled away and strode off, the door closing as he went back inside.

"My god." I leaned against the palm tree for support. What was that all about? Did he really want me to do his bookkeeping? Was I qualified?

I knew he wanted more from me than that, and that I'd be there at midnight. Then I realized he hadn't even asked my name.

* * * *

"Where were you? You missed a great speech," Alma chirped, spearing cheese with her little fork.

"I just needed some air." We were sitting on the couch now. The crowd had already thinned out a little. Apparently, some of the guests had only come to hear Rock Weldon give his speech.

And was going to be working for him.

The thought blew me away.

"Yoohoo. Earth to Lacey." Alma waved her hand in front of my face.

"Sorry."

"You're just not here, are you?" She frowned.

"No, I am. Just a little distracted."

"Well, why don't you meet someone I think you'd like?" Alma's voice was teasing.

"I really don't think-"

"I do. He's not interested in me, but then I'm not as gorgeous as you. He's Rock Weldon's cousin and he's pretty high up in the company."

"Oh, oh no." My heart leapt.

"What is with you?" Alma gave me a suspicious look.

"Nothing. I'm just not sure I'm into dating right now." Definitely not the boss's cousin.

"What can it hurt to say hello? He's over there. Let's go."

She dragged me up from the couch toward a handsome man with brown hair, not unlike Rock Weldon's. The crowd parted.

"Hi, John. This is my friend Lacey Pate. Lacey, John Weldon."

The man took my hand, half bowed over it and kissed it. "Wonderful to meet you," I said, surprised my voice sounded halfway normal.

His brown eyes danced with mirth. "The pleasure is all mine."

Across the room, someone else caught my eye. Rock Weldon was staring at me, and he didn't look happy. I froze up.

"Lacey," Alma whispered and poked me.

"What?"

She gave me a glare. I focused on John Weldon again, but Rock's stare was burning a hole through me.

"And what do you do, Ms. Pate?"

"I'm a bookkeeper, or I was." Tiny little lie there, but I wasn't totally sure I had a job yet with his cousin, so no need to say I did.

"I see." His eyes narrowed.

"Yes, Lacey is looking for a job so if you hear of anything, let me know." Alma grinned at me.

I wanted to fall through the floor.

"I'll do that. Can I have your number...Lacey?" He took out his phone.

"Sure." I recited it for him, glancing Rock Weldon's way. He was gone.

A surge of disappointment ran through me, and I realized I wanted this job as his intern more than anything.

John grinned at me. "I'll be in contact. It was nice meeting you, Lacey."

"Likewise." I smiled back, but my heart wasn't in it. On any other night, I'd have been thrilled to meet John Weldon, but not tonight.

"Well, we're going to mingle some more." Alma touched my arm.

"Yes, nice to meet you." I nodded toward John Weldon and turned away, relieved.

"What is with you?" Alma demanded. "He's hot! And you practically gave him the brush off." Her black eyes shot sparks of anger at me.

"I'm sorry. My mind's just on other things, I guess." We headed toward the punch table.

My watch read 10:35. The time seemed to be passing in agonizing slowness.

"Other things? He's really nice, and nothing like Rock. Rock's handsome and wealthy, but he's something of a player or so I've heard. Rumor is he's really kinky."

"Oh." My face grew hot.

So that's what he wanted me for. Maybe. One of his fantasies. Well, we'd see about that. He might be devastatingly handsome, but I could say no.

"My advice is, if John calls you, be nice. You never know what might come of it." She winked and we settled into a corner with our drinks.

After chatting with various workmates of Alma's my nerves were on edge. All I could think about was Rock Weldon. Was he kinky? Kinkier than the fantasies that had plagued me all my life of being owned, of being cherished at the same time? Could he be a womanizing pervert?

"You about ready to go?"

Alma's voice brought me back to myself. I hadn't thought about that. I'd ridden with her.

"Uh, no. I think I'm going to stay a while."

"You are acting so weird." She sighed. "Are you sure?"

"I am." I gave her a bright smile. "I think I'd like to talk to John Weldon some more." I crossed my fingers behind my back at the white lie.

"Oh. Okay, whatever. Glad you came around." She mock waved. "Ta ta. I want all the gory details tomorrow, Lace."

"Sure thing." I grinned at her, relieved she'd bought my lie, even as I felt terrible for doing it.

I watched her disappear, and my nerves jumped back to attention. I stole another glance at my watch as I took a large swallow of wine. 11:40. Twenty more minutes. I scurried around till I found a bathroom and locked myself into the stall, trying to collect my wits.

The truth was, I was wet just thinking about Rock Weldon and our meeting.

It's just work, I told myself. I was alone, so I made my way out of the stall on shaky legs and stood before the vanity. I redid my lipstick-pale pink-and my face powder. I'd always gone for a natural look, but I still wanted to look my best. I frowned at my dress. The scoop neck was becoming, but I wished I'd worn something a bit more daring. At least the heels were sexy and the fishnet hose were eye catching.

A thought struck me as I was spraying on a dash of perfume. Why did a billionaire like Rock Weldon need a bookkeeper?

I shrugged at myself in the mirror and smoothed my hair. I'd just have to find out. The seconds ticked away on my watch. I inhaled a deep breath. It was time.

* * * *

The walk to the balcony took forever. It was like walking under water. My breath kept hitching, and I wondered if I'd faint. Would he be waiting, or would he even come?

He had to be playing with me. A man like him could have any woman he wanted. Why me? I was the wrong woman anyhow. I hadn't even applied for a position with his company.

Somehow, I made it to the balcony. I wrenched open the French doors, trying to keep my balance. I was trembling all over. I stumbled to the railing. No one was out there but me.

"I knew it," I muttered. "He was playing with me. I'll have to call a cab." It was 12:03 by my watch. I bit my lip, upset with myself at how much I'd wanted him to show up.

Once a fool, always a fool. Other men had played with me in the past, and I was shy because of it. Alma knew it. She dated regularly, but me? Hardly ever.

I gaze out onto the city lights and thought of how small I was. No one a billionaire would ever care about. And screw him. He wasn't so hot as I remembered-but I knew it was a lie. I clenched the railing. One more minute, and I'd go. I wouldn't wait here like a fool for him all night.

"You came."

I gasped at the sound of his voice right behind me, at the feel of his warm breath against my neck.

"Don't turn around and don't speak."

My pulse thundered in my ears, and my body responded to him. My inner thighs were slippery.

"I want to see if you can do as you're told. That's what I'm looking for-a woman who knows how to take orders, who can help me run my business." His voice was a controlled whisper.

I nodded, unsure if he even wanted me to do that. It was as if I were watching myself from outside my body. All the responses I'd thought of were useless now. I wanted Rock Weldon, as ridiculous as such an idea was for a woman like me. The question was how far would I go to see what he wanted?

"Do you trust me?"

I just swallowed.

"You can speak. I need to know what type of person you are. Do you take things on faith? Do you live by your gut like I do? That's how I've made my fortune." His lips brushed my ear, and a shiver slammed through me.

"I-I don't know you."

"But do you trust me? I need you to do that." The voice was hard like an unmoving stone.

"I'll try."

"You'll have to do more than try. Show me by letting me do what I desire to you. The first moment I saw you out there, I forgot about Ms. Phelps." Rock chuckled. "I didn't care who you were. I was going to have you as my bookkeeper."

The way he said the word made it sound dirty, and my legs threatened to buckle.

"Steady there." He touched me then, pressing his body against mine. His erection was smashed hard against my ass.

Anyone could see us. I knew the party wasn't over yet. My cheeks burned with embarrassment and need.

As if he'd read my mind, he said, "I don't care if people can see us. Your job is to do what I say, when I say it-that is, if you want the job. Understood?"

Somehow the words weren't unkind. His tone was firm but gentle, and I wanted to do what he asked, what he demanded.

I nodded, my head spinning with the intoxicating scent of him, like cedar and spices off a hot, dry desert. And I was thirsty for him and for a job. But mostly for him. I'd have done anything he said for free at that moment.

His warm hand slithered up inside the back of my dress. I had to stifle a cry. I panted as he yanked my hose down past my ass.

"So what if they see?" He taunted me, his tongue licking the shell of my ear.

I moaned softly, resisting the urge to press against his hard cock.

He worked my panties down past my ass with one hand. Rock was definitely talented. He slid his hand under me and his fingers were inside me.

I closed my eyes, feeling like I would pass out as he explored my wet folds. His fingers teased my cl*t as the others worked inside me. Just as I found myself on the edge of orgasm, my breath coming in quiet gasps, he slowed the circular motion of his fingers down.

"Not yet."

I groaned, unable to stop myself.

"You're a good girl, aren't you?"

I bit my lip, pleasure zinging through me as he started the slow circling of my cl*t again with his finger, his other digits sliding in and out of my pu**y. I couldn't hold back much longer.

"It's alright. You can come for me now."

I whimpered. Stopping my orgasm would have been impossible anyway. His fingers moved in a fast rhythm, and I reached my peek. I shouted softly, my world exploding into little pieces.

His hand slowed, and he extricated it.

I grasped the balcony, feeling like I would collapse. When was the last time I'd had an orgasm like that?

Never.

He moved to my side. I couldn't look at him.

"You follow directions well. You're hired."

I stared at him then, my mouth open. Hired for what? I couldn't form the words. I was still dazed and out of breath. I swallowed hard.

"I guess I need to know your name for tax purposes." A small smile played about his sensuous lips.

His eyes were definitely clear green.

"Lacey. Lacey Pate." I whispered my name.

"Congratulations, Lacey. We'll see how long you last. Take the cab you find out front and I'll send word of your first assignment tomorrow."

I just stood there as he walked back inside.

* * * *

Somehow I made it to the cab which was waiting outside, just as he'd said it would be. No one gave me any funny looks, but my head swam at the thought of what he'd done to me in plain sight, how he'd touched me, and what I wanted him to do to me now.

All the way home, I puzzled it out. Was he serious? Or was this just something he did to unattached women at parties to give them a thrill?

I gave up trying to figure it out. I just wouldn't get my hopes up. I'd continue on with my life and not expect him to contact me, even though he'd said he would.

When I got home, I slept like the dead, in spite of how keyed up I'd been with Rock Weldon.

* * * *

Loud pounding on my apartment door exploded into my consciousness. I groaned, my hangover evident. I'd had more wine than I thought, and then there was Rock Weldon...

"Oh my god. Rock Weldon." I leapt out of bed, frantically searching for anything to put on. Cotton shorts and a t-shirt were it. "It can't be him," I murmured.

Another knock came.

I ran to the door as quietly as I could and looked out the peephole. Not Rock but a man and a limousine in my driveway.

This could not be happening. I gulped and eased the door open.

"Ms. Pate?" The man smiled.

"Yes?"

"I'm Rob Forrester, a driver for Mr. Weldon."

I clung to the door to keep from falling down. "I see."

He smiled as if I were a bit slow. "He's here to fetch you. He's waiting in the limousine. He said to grab your keys and a few incidentals. Don't worry about clothing and come along."

I just stared at him.

"Miss?"

"Yes." I looked at the limousine. I couldn't see anything through the tinted windows. Was Rock Weldon really in there?

"Mr. Weldon doesn't like to be kept waiting."

"Oh, right." I shut the door in Mr. Forrester's face and scurried through my small apartment. I grabbed an old suitcase and threw a toothbrush, makeup, and a few sets of clothing in it.

I just couldn't leave with nothing to wear. After all, I had no idea where I was going. I punched in Alma's number on my phone, praying she'd pick up at work.

"Hey!"

"Alma, can't talk now. Will you check on the apartment for me in a few days if I need you to?"

"Sure. Is everything okay?"

"Just fine."

"You sound flustered."

"I am, but I'm okay."

"Alright. Take care of yourself where ever you're going. And call me one way or the other. I'm worried about you after last night. You're acting so strangely." Alma sighed.

"I'm fine. Really. I'll call you soon." I pressed end and slid my feet into my flipflops.

Here goes nothing.

I opened the front door. Mr. Forrester was still waiting.

"Right this way, Miss." He grinned at me, took my suitcase, and led me down the steps and opened the back door of the limo.

"Glad you decided to come, Lacey." Rock's voice was hard.

"Yes." I cleared my throat and climbed inside. He was sitting all the way over to the left of the vehicle, his face turned away.

"Ugly city, isn't it?" He didn't wait for me to answer. "That's why I'm not sticking around."

I said nothing, wondering what he was talking about. I didn't find San Francisco ugly at all and wondered why he'd say such a thing.

"You may speak now, you know."

I said nothing. Tears threatened. What was I doing?

"Lacey, I'm not harsh, but I do demand that a job is done well if you take it. Here are the terms if you agree on a formal acceptance of the position as my personal bookkeeper at Regal Industries."

I found my voice. I didn't want to be pushed around, handsome billionaire who wanted me, or not. "Let's hear them."

He grinned. "I like your style." The smile faded, and he was all business again. "Number one. Our arrangement will last for a year. Number two. Your salary will be $100,000 per year."

I made a gurgling sound in my throat. What? Was he nuts? I didn't have enough experience for that.

He held up a hand. "Hear me out. Number three. Your main job is to please me. That one's really important. It's the biggest thing in keeping your job."

I nodded, my palms slick. Three feet divided us in the backseat. It seemed like a gulf. I wanted to touch and taste him as he'd done to me the night before.

"Number four. Whatever I tell you about business...or other things," his gaze slid down my body, and I shivered, "stays private. No exceptions."

"I understand."

"Good." He flashed ultra-white teeth at me and loosened his collar, unbuttoning the top button and yanking at his tie. The motion made heat prickle her spine.

"I think I can do that."

He tipped his head. "There are a couple more requirements to the job."

"Oh." I clasped my hands in my lap, hoping he wouldn't see them trembling.

"Number five. Your job will be wherever I am. You're never to leave my side, not for the whole year. If I'm in a city, you're there, too. Your office will be next to or in my office, and you will work. Hard. For me." He broke the words up like lashes from a whip. "That sort of thing, and I mean that very seriously."

"Okay." That was a little odd. Control freak much?

"Good. And the last one. We're going to Venice. We're leaving right now."

"As in Italy? For a year?" I sounded dumb even to myself, but I couldn't help it.

"Yes, now."

"I need to do so many things."

He waved a hand, dismissing all my concerns. "It's now or never. Make your choice. You have a few minutes to decide. Other women would love this position, but I choose you, Lacey."

Indignation flared within me. Who did he think he was? At the same time, I was flattered.

"Come over here." He crooked a finger at me, and my body went tingly all over.

I hesitated for only a minute. I was going with him. I might be insane, but who wouldn't make the choice I was going to in my situation?

I slid over to him, just inches away. His scent made my head spin. I was reminded of things old and new and of warm places on dark nights.

"Take your shirt off."

I bit my lip. "I can't do that."

"I need a bookkeeper, someone I can trust, Lacey. Is that you? Will you give yourself to me, reveal yourself to me?"

"I don't know you."

"I understand that, but surely you know something of me at least from the papers. Faith is part of the deal."

I closed my eyes. "I don't know what to do."

"Yes. You do. You've already decided."

He pulled me to him. I watched him signal Mr. Forrester by pushing a button. The limo lurched onto the road.

"Can he see us?" My lips were at his throat where he held me against him.

"So what if he can, but the answer is no. Whatever I want to happen, I make happen, Lacey. You'll find that out."

"I suppose you think I'm just another person you can order around." My voice shook.

"Hardly." He hugged me closer to him. My lips brushed his throat, and a buzz at the contact shot through me. He was like a drug.

Rock grabbed a fistful of my hair, and I looked up at him. He crushed my mouth to his, but it wasn't at all painful. His lips were insistent. He nipped at my mouth and parted my lips with his teeth and tongue.

"I don't do well not having a woman around, Lacey-a woman who understands my needs."

I moaned as he brushed my lips again with his, his hand against the small of my back.

"What does bookkeeping really have to do with this?" I gasped out when he let my lips out of captivity.

"More than I'd like it to." His voice was grim, and he broke the embrace.

"I'm sorry if I said the wrong thing."

He frowned and looked out the window. The city sped by us.

We really were going to the airport and to Venice. I still couldn't believe it.

"No apologizing. There are things going on in the business. Believe me. I need your hard work for me this year. Staying in control is very important to me." The troubled look hadn't left his face when he turned back to me. I wondered if he meant more than just control in the boardroom. I knew that he did. His business life and private life were interconnected. He was a man interested in power and maintaining it.

I'd always been passive and had never engaged someone like him. Until now.

My gaze rested on his lap. I could see his arousal, and I was burning up inside. I stared at him through my lashes.

"Touch me, Lacey."

I didn't move.

"You know what I mean. Let me have what I want."

Something inside me melted at those words, and I wanted nothing more than to give him what he wanted-whatever that was.

I ran my hand against his trousers and the rigid rod there. He sucked in a breath.

"Do it now. I need you."

The urgency in his voice propelled me on. I fumbled for the button on his pants, nervous. He took my hand and guided me. I pulled down his zipper, and his c**k lay there for me under silken underpants.

I squirmed against the seat, my own arousal already painful.

"You never took your shirt off. Do it now." His tone brooked no argument, his voice hoarse with need.

Need of me.

I took my hand away from his underwear and slowly took my shirt off, unable to meet his gaze. My br**sts sprang free. I hadn't had time to get a bra. I hadn't even thought of it in the rush of things. I felt exposed and hot. My ni**les pebbled as he studied them.

"Look at me, Lacey. I want to see you look in my eyes-I can read you, you know?"

I didn't answer, but I locked gazes with him, and the raw desire in his eyes made me shudder. I wondered if he could bring me to orgasm just with that look.

I wanted him to touch me. My br**sts ached for it.

"Take off your shorts now. Leave your underwear on."

My hands shook as I complied with his command. I was glad I was wearing red lacy panties, one of my nicest pairs that only one other man had ever seen. They were already soaking wet.

"Take it in your hands."

Heat rose to my cheeks at how forward he was. He didn't flinch as he said it.

I wondered how many times he'd done this before, with how many women.

"Trust me."

I nodded and pulled his underwear back, freeing his cock. In my meager experience, he was large. My hands shook.

"Relax. I like you." He tilted his head and grinned.

That gave me courage. I leaned over him.

"Put it between your tits."

I closed my eyes, feeling myself go red to the roots of my hair. I did what he asked, and he moaned.

"That feels so good. I love your soft tits."

From seemingly out of nowhere, Rock drizzled oil on his cock.

"Move up and down." I did as he asked, letting my mouth and tongue just catch the top of his c**k as my tits made a vise around his rigid dick. His c**k slid between my br**sts, over and over, and I moaned, my arousal painful.

"Stop."

I let go of his cock, not wanting to.

"Lie down. Put your head on my lap." He spoke in short gasps, and I was pleased to see how I'd affected him. He was rock hard. I lay with my head near his c**k and spread my body out along the seat.

"Limos come in handy for this sort of thing," he said and laughed.

I laughed, too. Then he silenced me by tangling his fingers in my hair with a tenderness I couldn't believe was in a man like him. He played with it, wrapping it around his c**k and stroking. Watching him do that almost drove me mad.

"Your hair is so soft, Lacey. I'm going to come on your face."

"Yes."

"Touch yourself while I do." He grabbed his c**k firmly, and I whimpered, turning my head to flick my tongue against it once.

I was putty in his hands.

He stroked his c**k up and down, staring deep into my eyes. I felt like he was seeing all of me, every last bit, including all my insecurities and failures.

I told myself it was just foreplay. Nothing else.

I swallowed at how far afield my hopes were already getting. That was dangerous territory with a man who could take what he wanted and then discard it. A man will billions of dollars had no need of a woman like me.

As if reading my mind as he'd done earlier, he whispered, "touch your pu**y. Make yourself come."

I closed my eyes, overwhelmed at the feeling I saw in his eyes, the desire that was all for me.

He pumped his c**k harder as I opened my eyes again and swirled my fingers over my clit, sighing as my own pleasure built. I imagined him inside of me, and my movements grew frenzied.

"I love watching you." He spoke in gasps. "I'm going to come. Are you ready? Come with me." He wasn't making a request. He was commanding.

I nodded. He released his seed on my face with a shout. At the feel of the salty, thick warmth on my lips, eyes, and cheeks, I cried out with my own cl**ax, my pu**y clenching over and over in waves.

He looked down at me for a minute and smiled. "Well done."

I thought of how I must look with his cum on my face.

"Let me wipe that for you. You're so gorgeous, Lacey." He mopped my face gently with a fine, silk handkerchief he pulled out of his pocket. He'd never taken his shirt and sport coat off.

"Thank you."

"I mean it. I hope you know that. You will know that by the time I'm done with you." At this words, my stomach clenched.

Done with me? I was beginning to think a year would never be long enough with him.

"We just pulled up at the airport." He threw the handkerchief in a little bag near his leg. "You have some new clothes there." He pointed at a compartment in the middle of the row of seats in front of us.

"Thanks."

"Hurry. We don't have much time." His jaw clenched, and I sensed his mood had changed again.

"I will." I jerked the shorts and top on, and he dressed, too. The clothes fit me perfectly and were much nicer than anything I'd normally buy. I wondered how he'd known my size.

Just as I was finished getting ready, his cell phone rang.

He listened for a minute.

"Yeah. Right. Well, I'll deal with it when I get to Venice. Don't call me again." He barked the last sentence into the phone and jabbed a button.

"Everything okay?"

"Far from it, but you knew that already. Let's go to Venice." He gave me a cold smile, and fear coiled in my belly. Would I survive this year with a man so sexy and volatile? Or was this all some kind of joke?

I followed him out of the limo, ignoring every man but him. Venice, here we come.
