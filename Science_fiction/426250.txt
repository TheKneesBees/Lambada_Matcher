Girl World – The USA

	Jenny Smith stepped through the hairdresser’s door excitedly. The wind made her hair uncombed for the last time, so her big green eyes and plump lips were happy in advance. She sat down on the pink chair, crossed her slim legs, she was looking at her freshly manicured nails, and it was her turn with her hair too, almost immediately.
- Hello Jenny! Why are you so happy? – the similarly thin Lucy George, the hairdresser began to speak, what meant – the local girls all knew – that it’s the next patient’s turn.
- Hi Lucy! Please, very hurry because… There is something I didn’t tell you because you’re would sure to fly into a tantrum about the jealousy! – Jenny stood up and sat down to the snow-white patient chair. The girls who went there from the neighborhood, knew the hairdresser girl’s name, but she was Lucy’s friend for a long time.
- Oh my God, are you meeting a guy?! – the blond girl was laughing and stared making the hairstyle they already talked previously.
- You stupid! – brought out the convulsions of laughter from her – I’m not going that for back in the time. But only perm can help my hairstyle, so I will bring back this trend into 2031.
- But tell me what happened and how are you bringing back the trend alone!
- Because of that same thing – they laughed.
- And are you going to tell it me one time? Or are you going to tell it, when the guys will resurrect?
- But surely won’t you be angry?
- I won’t – almost shouted the hairdresser girl crossly.
- Well… Tomorrow I’m going to a beauty contest as a racer! – the other was grinning.
- So what? Do you must blow that thing up so much? That is going to be just municipal, isn’t it?
- No…
- What?! What’s that no?!
- National.
- So you already were on a municipal one? And you didn’t tell it to your best friend?!
- You said you won’t be angry!
- You’re ready. Give me the money! Hi!
- Hi!
- It’s the next’s turn!
- Hi Lucy! – a brunette girl in a yellow dress was standing up from the waiting’s chair.
- Hello! You’re not going to a beauty contest as a racer, are you?
- Why, is it a problem? – Katy Lohan answered shily.
- What??? Now is it real?!
- Why, am I ugly? It’s possible but nowadays the trendiest thing is if I attend that big girlish thingies, and I can’t assert myself, I have tried it, I need something bigger thing to people accept me! – Katy’s tears were flowing.
- OK, sorry, I didn’t want to be rude, just… It’s the same, I didn’t even ask you what like hairstyle would you like…
- What do you think, what like would be fine for me? Or would anything become me at all?
- Shut up! You’re already a totally cute girl, just you’ve already done too much things to your hair! When did you war it naturally for the last time?
- I don’t know…
- Maybe the problem is that you made yourself totally plastic. What if you wore it it just let escaped? – Lucy took the rubbers and barrettes out of Katy’s hair – However, it’s totally fragmented…
- I know.
- I think in spite of fact that, war it escaped, I suggest you a shampoo, and I will give a wave till then. If it will get straight for tomorrow, come back again, or you can do it at home too. We will defeat that bitchy!
- OK… Who are you talking about?
- It’s not matter, you have to win!
	Jenny returned home after the solarium too, put down her ivory-colored purse, took off her light blue sandal and looked in the mirror. She was satisfied with her hair, nails and skin, but she felt like she didn’t have enough strength of mind to do over the beauty contest tomorrow, without her friend. She took back her sandal and purse, and sat to her. It was like the wind, what didn’t made her hair uncombed yet, urged her to go there where Lucy lived, because they were should to make it up with each order. As she was considering what to tell her, the time went so fast that she was surprised how fast she arrived to the little pink house, next to the many-colored cars and houses. The house had blinding white fence what made unambiguous that the house wasn’t as light as the white fence what was glittering from the sunshine, just pale pink, and it was unambiguous that it wasn’t red, wasn’t purple and wasn’t orange but pink, because it was pale. A lot of people admired this house, but Jenny already got used to her friend’s house, and now the only thing that interested her was that she should make it up with her and get ready for the beauty contest with one hundred percent. She rang, and surprised when noticed that she was still wearing the same clothes what she worked in: the dark pink top and the purple pants, what reflected her house: the dark pink didn’t seem to be purple next to the purple pants. Jenny was mulling on their conflict so long that she was feeling like days passed since their talking at the tonsorial.
- Hi… - Jenny began to speak when Lucy opened the door.
- Hi. I think you want to make it up with me – the other girl answered objectively. Jenny didn’t count on this, so she surprised a bit.
- Are you still angry with me? – Lucy turned her head away and didn’t answer, she was just standing with arms folded – But can I go In? – Jenny began again.
- Yes – Jenny founded herself in the usual hall where was purple wallpaper with flower pattern. There were blue floor and dark brown coat racks. But she wasn’t in that mood how she used to step into there.
	The telephone rang in Lucy’s room; she hurried into it and answered. Jenny slowly followed her.
- Hi – Lucy answered, standing in front of her magenta desk.
- Hello! I remember that you said how fragmented my hair is and what shampoo I need for that, and that it need have wave until it like this, but what I used to do and what should I do so it wouldn’t become like this again?
- I think you dye your hair, don’t you?
- Yes.
- So it’s because of that. But if you used to dye and you continue dying, it is going to become more attractive after some use.
- After how many use exactly?
- About three or five. But the beauty contest is tomorrow, isn’t it?
- Yes, I just thought in advance.
- If you use more expensive dye beside to the shampoo, it is going to be more attractive, but won’t be  more quickly.
- Thanks! Bye! – Katy said.
- My pleasure! Bye! – Lucy finished the conversation happily, but she turned round frightened from Jenny’s voice.
- I’m not the only one who has to say sorry, I see.
- What are you talking about?
- I heard that you help somebody else to win the beauty contest.
- Why, should I help one who concealed from me the contest?!
- Just because I was afraid to you will be jealous of me because I’m entering for it! – Jenny was shouting it and her tears was flowing – I need you for the beauty contest, I can’t go there if my best friend hates me, because of this trifle as an addition, and without that good friend and good hairdresser too like you, you don’t need any good hairdresser to reach a good position on the content, but I can prove only with it indeed!
- You’re so good friend! – Lucy was moved. Then her mobile rang again.
- Hello! One more thing came into my head! – it was Katy.
- Sorry, but I think you should looking for another hairdresser. I’m … very…. busy now… And if I continued to help you, I worked against my friend – Jenny turned towards.
- So you don’t answer me either that what like hair would be advantageous for me on the national content, on the next week?
- But the national one is on tomorrow!
- What??? No! Tomorrow is the municipal one! That is exactly, both of them, the national one earlier, after that the municipal, and next week, if I will reach a stage when, I can go for the national one.
- So I didn’t work against my friend!
- What!!!
- Nothing, just I still can work for you!
- Good, so do you tell me what like hair do you suggest me for next week?
- Sorry, but it isn’t my duty. You can decide on it too, can’t you?
- So why did I ask it?! And why did you help me till now?
- My friend concealed from me that she was on the municipal beauty content as a racer, and today told me that she is going to the national one tomorrow, and I wanted to work against her – she looked at Jenny – but I know now how good friend is she in spite of fact that.
- So is it a big request too, to answer my question?
- In the end, when your hair won’t be fragmented, you can show with any hairstyle what you like and what fits to your style.
- But I think don’t every hairstyle would be advantageous for me.
- So try some hairstyles at home and look for what ones are advantageous for you, or come to me, and I will do it for you.
- OK. Bye!
- Bye!
- Now why did you backbite me to this stranger girl?! I’ve already said that I concealed it only for our friendship!
- Sorry, but she inquired me so much that this was necessary to shake her off! Now will we have a quarrel again?
- Why didn’t you lie?!
- If you really did it because of our friendship, why are you ashamed of doing that?!
- You didn’t say her I did it because of our friendship!
- But I told her how good friend you are.
- OK? I will forgive you, I will need you much tomorrow.
- You’re my friend only to I help you?! – Lucy was indignant.
- No. I’m so proud of I have this super friend who isn’t only beautiful but is such a good hairdresser too!
- Thoughts! – Lucy laughed happily – I will do you a hairstyle that you surely will finish between in first ones!
- Isn’t perm enough?
- It’s possible to do with it more too. Come in to me tomorrow, I will do it then!
- OK? I’m going now, I should get ready a bit too for the beauty content.
- Hi! – Jenny left Lucy’s house happily and satisfied, in good mood as she used to. She succeeds to make peace with her friend, and she is going to the national beauty content tomorrow! She was looking around on the street happily on the way. She noticed only now how blooming colored are the houses, the cars, the flowers, the gross, the trees and the sky in the sunshine. What’s more, it was like she was seeing a man, approaching from the distance, but it was surely just the mirage what made a girl that odd, and Jenny was so happy now that she saw this good thing.

	Next morning, at ten, Katy stepped out from her light orange house and set to the solarium. The beauty content is going to be start at two on the afternoon in any case. She went to by taxi for two streets, then saved her rest of money, and walked further on foot. It’s so funny – she tank – a desolate place is nearest where there is a solarium, from the other deserted place! She looked around how she usually did when she come here, is that is a building under construction or not, and she saw surprised tat it is. Then she almost fainted.
	No, surely some girls are joking with her! But this man’s everything is so manly, surly anybody didn’t get up a mask and some man clothes! She was standing on one place almost in shock, for seconds that seemed like hours.
- Hello. Is the world this deserted since that crazy woman tried to wipe us out? – the man began to speak– You’re surprised to seeing a man I see – he was smiling. It was like this voice, this move, this look and this smile resembled somebody. Somebody famous man from that age when there still were men.
- This is… a deserted place exceptionally… Oh my God, I’m talking to a man! – Katy was laughing.
- Haven’t you ever met with any men? I know from the TV that a crazy woman tried to annihilate us, but there were so many victim of the poison?
- I’ve never seen any guys in live! Moreover, hw believed there aren’t any of them! How did you stay alive?!
- I’m curious to know it too.
- Why haven’t you met anybody till now?! I mean, after dropping down the poison. Surely would know it already all the world! Do you lie in hiding because you’re famous? You very resemble a movie star!
- I woke up a few days ago. I know that this is very odd, but my last memory is that I had to lie in something ice for some seconds on filming. That stupid director thought the glass wouldn’t be lifelike enough. Other actors gave something chemical agent for the glass that worked by chance in reality, and they really hibernated me. Other actors had to do it too, but when E woke up, I couldn’t wake tem up. The ice already almost totally melted from them, but they didn’t have breathing, heartbeat and pulse either.
- So it seems I’m speaking at first on the world to the only man all over the world! When I will tell it a lot of TV’s, I’m going to be almost as famous as you! Is that true that you’re a world-famous actor? What’s your most famous movie or series where I could see you in? What’s your name at all? Sorry if I’m speaking queer but I’ve never met any world star, let alone a man!
- I’m Laurence Fishburne, you’ve could see me in The Matrix or SCI, these are my most famous movie and series.
- I’m Katy. CSI is still, or again on TV and I’ve seen some parts of it, and when I was a little girl, I’ve seen The Matrix or it’s third part! – the girl was exulting – The Matrix was such an exciting movie but crimes don’t really hold my attention.
- I didn’t see any parts of CSI before I got a cast in it, in turn it was already for nine years on TV, but I watched some parts of it before filming. The Matrix was a really exciting movie but I didn’t have too much time to give some thought to that how I liked it, because we had to learn kung fu so much. It’s odd that the first part were already twelve years old when they frosted me, and I slept over twelve years.
- Did you dream about something? – Katy asked with curious eyes.
- The ice frosts the brain too, so it was like I was dead.
- Where were you for days after you woke up?
- I got know from the TV that’s in the caravan where are the filming accessories that what happened to the world. I saw that everybody disappeared from the location so I watched TV to maybe I will get know from it what happened. Suddenly, somebody mentioned that “since men died out” and “because women who older than thirty already don’t live”, I was almost in shock for some days, and didn’t leave the caravan. When I still didn’t was frosted, I had a wife, a son, a mother, a father, some friends, some kindred. And a daughter… I think my younger daughter is still alive if didn’t hit her an accident or a deadly illness.
- Well, I understand it… But I don’t understand why you mentioned your older daughter that way.
- People already don’t remember this scandal at least in this world. It’s better if you don’t know because they would speak about it again. It’s already a problem too that I said the word “scandal”.
- Sorry to hindered you so long time, you surely looking forward to seeing your other daughter, and I think you have to tell that all two times if not more times. And I promise you I won’t mention the scandal to anybody.
- Actually, it seems like I met Delilah nowadays, like this twenty years difference didn’t exist. I got know from the TV too that it’s already 2031. This all thing is like I was a main character in a movie, but this is the reality, and this talking  makes me feel that this really happens because it’s like they made with me an interview again – he was smiling.
- I will tell this all thing instead of you if you want, I want to be famous anyway. And I will help you to fend Delilah, you’re surely curious what like girl she became in her twenties – she gave him her phone number – I have to go now because I’m applying on a beauty content today. Watch it on the city channel and vote on me! Bye! – Katy hurried into the solarium and she already called the news programs of TV channels what ‘s number she searched on her mobile, on the internet, on the way. For the first time, of course they didn’t believe her but she promised them that she will sattle that they will meet the man, and the TV channels admitted it.
Laurence went back into the caravan, and watched TV because he was curious that what like the world became. He already didn’t went out to the street because he knew that he was the only man on the world, and girls were nagging him if he met more of them. 
What a good timing: he haven’t eat anything for days because of the nervous depression, and now he can lose some weight for when and now he is going to be a greater star than before then they frosted him. He have put on some kilos at that time. 
He got know surprised that people didn’t invent anything in the last twenty years. But later it came into his head that already only girls lived on the world, and the inventors are usually men, and older than the people who live today. After he got bored with watching TV, he was considering what will he tell Delilah after the past decades, and why he was that man who stayed alive, other men why didn’t, why do only that girls live on the world who are younger than thirty, older women why didn’t, and while he was considering, fell asleep, by no means he couldn’t sleep for days after lying unconscious in the ice for twenty years and since he got know what things happened twenty years ago.
On the beauty content, Katy was shining with her tanned skin and beautifully waved hair, and was beaming with joy because she was going to be a star, and all of that helped her to finish third. That thing didn’t dreve her into a frenzy either that most of the onlookers were lesbian.
When Laurence will got know it, she is going to be the first girl on the world for twenty years who is with a man! Then her boyfriend going to be the most famous one on the world!
Jenny was anxious on the beauty content, but Lucy was sitting in the first row of the onlookers, and was rooting for her. She made her a beautiful bun on that day, before the content, and let a curl down on each side. Jenny were wearing a light blue, long evening dress, without straps, and a pink bikini. She reached rank second. The two friends discussed it with each order that they will organize a party to celebrate this success, but they didn’t have any strength for it because they celebrated the winner till down, so they only had a shower and went to sleep.
The municipal beauty content finished at eight in the evening, with celebrating the winner. Katy decided to doesn’t celebrate that she ranked third, to don’t let it slip during the party that who she met with today, before the beauty content, and that her position could help her to make a relationship with him. She was so happy because of this, that it was always in her mind that how famous was she going to be. She almost couldn’t speak anything else, only about it, and the alcohol would get it out from her that have met Laurence. The right thing to do was to drink some alcohol when they celebrated somebody, also when she was the person feted, she was in vain happy without any drink too. 
Instead of organizing the party, she called Laurence, who’s number she found in her mobile, between her didn’t receive calls. They discussed that they will meet tomorrow, where they met at the first time, and they will go to Katy’s house, where Laurence can search Delilah on some community places on the net if she’s there on one of them. If not, she will ask her friend if they know a twenty-four-year-old, Afro-American girl with that name, if not, she will ask their to ask their friends, and so on. After that, on the afternoon, people are going to be waiting for them to the TV studio. Any reporter weren’t willing to go there, it was easily possible that Katy lied, and they could spend some of their money unnecessarily for travelling.
The girl also told him of course that she ranked third on the beauty content, maybe the man didn’t watched it over.
They met at half past nine on the morning how they discussed it. Katy was wearing a pink top with straps and a low-cut neckline, and the top reached only till her belly. Her skirt was short and she was wearing a white sandal with tall heel and a circle-earring. On her face there was beautifully used makeup and her hair was in a ponytail, put on the side. She already wanted to start the temptation with this clothes, with the sexy necklace, with her beautiful make-up, with her pretty hairstyle and that earring what was advantageous for her. The tall heel was also useful for a girl who wanted to be that tall man’s girlfriend like he was. And, of course, it wasn’t a chance that she invited him into her house, however, it was almost impossible to solve the searching on the internet because she didn’t want to Laurence meet other girls before he is going to stand in front of a TV camera.
Laurence was wearing a yellow T-shirt with white pants what stressed his brown skin. Katy just noticed now that maybe he looked great too. Lucky that the ice didn’t let him to get older because it would be hard to persuade herself to a bodily contact with an old man.
- Hello! – Katy was approaching, putting her well-shaped legs before each order, and her hip were moving from it to the right and left.
- Hi.
- You’re look well in that clothes. Where are they from?
- We luckily brought a lot of clothes for the filming. Can we go?
- Yeah – they set, Katy continued to walking like a model.
- How far do you live?
- It’s fifteen minutes by taxi, but if we will go on foot, we’re going to go on that way where we won’t meet any girls so they aren’t going to nag you.
- So we’re forced to go on foot.
- When you still had friends, did you talk to strangers too?
- When they used to congratulate me, I said thoughts, but not really in other situations.
- So I’m such a lucky one now!
- I have some questions too. I watched on TV yesterday what like the world became, and I saw that it haven’t changed anything in inventions. But who does man works? And how do you multiply?
- Girls don’t really invent anything, only men, and older men of them too.
- It came into my head too.
- But humanity’s survive is so important that we had do invent something for that, so academic’s joined forces, and they invented the artificial multiplier machine some years later. I don’t know how it works, I’m not an academic. But everybody has to work if she’s already eighteen years old or older, if she go to school and if she don’t too, so guy works can get girls too. It’s easier to be admitted to these works so some ones do these too, and of course, they get pay for that.
- And why live only girls who aren’t thirty years old yet?
- Who already very got used to the life with men, they were older than twenty-nine and some girls in their twenties, and they couldn’t imagine life without men and couldn’t absorb it, so they committed suicide.
- How many people in their twenties? – they arrived. That thing got to the man’s mind that maybe this is that place where he is going to got to know that his  daughter alives at all.
- A lot of them, more than half of them, but girls who are in their twenties now, they already got to the life without men.
- It’s logical in the end – Laurence felt like he took his frightening with his shoes together, in the pink hall. Katy buckled her sandal off, and took it beside Laurence’s shoes.
- Do you still want to know immediately where your daughter is?
- I came here to get know it.
- Well, it’s OK – they went into the room that was equipped with almost lighting green furniture and with light purple carpet and a yellow curtain. Katy turned on the computer – Do you know any community places on the net? I think you haven’t put yourself on any of that because people would constantly write to you.
- But I’ve heard these names. The question is do you use that ones then twenty years ago.
- So I will open these ones what we use. Search for Delilah while I’m getting changed to start off. Call me if you found her! – the girl took her most beautiful lingerie from her wardrobe and took it out from the room that way how Laurence couldn’t see these. In the bathroom, she stripped and took on her other bra and panties. She has seen in movies how women used to tempt.
	She was considering a bit what to tell and do when she will go into the room, than Laurence already called her that he found Delilah. Katy went back into the room, Laurence haven’t even looked at her.
- I haven’t find her on any community places yet but I noticed between the news that she won the national beauty content. She inherited her mother’s beauty – Katy become uncertain. He still wants his wife? – She still lives there, in that house where we used to live.
- It’s such a good thing. We still have a lot of time before start – she stroked over the man’s muscular arm. Laurence looked at her only now, and noticed what she was wearing.
- What are you doing, little girl?!
- We met so well, didn’t we?
- I could be your father and I even know you!
- I’m already a big girl. I’m already nineteen years old – she began to stroke Laurence’s thigh, but he shoved her hand from it and stood up from the chair.
- My other daughter was nineteen too when they frosted me! What do you want from me?!
- I thought if I will be with the only man on the world who is, as an addition, a world-famous actor…
- You’re just like my older sister! – the man left the house angrily and as quick as lighting. 
Katy was standing paralyzed almost for a minute, then she took her clothes on then called Laurence, thinking he already calmed down.
- Hello!
- It’s a shame that I deleted you, I didn’t answered if I knew that you called me. I would know that you won’t get off me because you need me to become a star in front of the TV cameras. At the end, they would believe that you’re not a bitch who could make a relationship of convenience but that you’re a girl who have lied once – Katy couldn’t even begin to speak between Laurence’s sentences, but she couldn’t say anything anyway – When we are going to meet in the show, I will tell what a big bitch you are, and it remain will be seen how much will you enjoy your fame.
- Isn’t there something else solution? Anyway, I helped you to find Delilah without you would meet anybody.
- It was your interest too because you didn’t want that to somebody else stand in front of the TV camera that she met me for the first time after twenty years. You will get what you wanted, you will be famous by me.
- Couldn’t I rather pay you to don’t tell it?
- I remind you little girl that I’m a world-famous actor. You can’t give me so much money to I forget what a big bitch wanted to exploit me.
- So why will you tell it in the show to a lot of people?! And how did your money endure?!
- Anybody haven’t been at the neighborhood of the filming location for twenty years ago, otherwise they would melt us. Our money we brought for during our being there are still in the caravan, with my credit card where most of my money is, and only I can take the rest of my money out of the bank too. Also the house where Delilah lives, is on my name, at least it is going to be my property when it will turn out that I’m alive.
- Instead of you want to take vengeance, you could be happy about that a young girl wanted to with you like me! You surely want them to know it because of that!
- I think a lot of teenage girls dream about me as about every or almost every star, but you could be with me on that way too that almost my look is the only thing what you know about me and you’re not my fan. Don’t want everybody to be with somebody who doesn’t like her or him at least a bit by his or her look. However people like you maybe do it and they merit to someone ready her a lesson. Well, do you still want to be famous if people are going to know you as a bitch?
- Katy became uncertain, mostly from this question. She was considering for seconds that what should she to say. She had to answer now, before they will miss time to arrive to the studio.
- Yes… But I will explain it away that, I will tell that I have never done anything like that!
- On the planet of girls? It’s no wonder.
- But there are lesbians too, and I haven’t done any favors like that either.
- The question is will they believe you or not.
- And you?!
- Why would I say anything like that about anybody, without any reason? – the girl was silent for more seconds.
- OK, just let’s hurry!
- We’ll meet I n the studio, bitch – the man turned the phone off.

	Katy went to the studio by taxi; her thoughts were whirling in her head during it. She was desperate for some minutes because of what are people going to thing about her that what a bitch is she. She wanted so much to say them that Laurence’s older daughter had something scandal! In all probability, it was something like she tried to do with Laurence because he said she is just like her. But if she will tell it, he is going to take vengeance because of it too. She thought she rather should to say good things about him to he won’t tell them that she would have sex with him to make together a relationship, to be famous. In any case, she realized by their talking what an intelligent man was he. She set to like him even if she didn’t like his look much more than an average-looking man.
	In the last some minutes, she was excited because of she was going to appear on TV and what a famous she is going to be when she will tell what happened to her yesterday. 
She arrived in front of a beautiful, big, white building and it took a lot of time for her to find that on which floor she had to leave the elevator and wich door she had to went through.
	Laurence went by taxi too, in any case only the taxi driver saw him during it and people didn’t use to let whoever in where he went to. The twenty-one-year-old taxi driver girl, of course, hardly could concentrate on driving because she met a man after twenty years, and she haven’t know yet, till now that a man is alive, as still anybody haven’t know it, only Katy. As an extra, Laurence is a world-famous movie star! She was looking forward to tell it her friends.
	When they arrived, she asked for an autograph, he signed it, than hurried in the studio to girls don’t hinder him with their questioning and with blocking his way.
	Laurence and Katy didn’t even speak to each order before the show. In their first appearing on TV, they, of course, were on a serious, important news-telling TV show where they talked with people. The studio had beautiful shades of blue what was serious, and, at the same time, a bit womanly.
	They answered to the blond, long-haired anchor jointly, by turns, they told what Laurence already told Katy before. The man told to watch another show of this TV channel too because he had something exciting to say too. Katy calmed down because he still haven’t humiliate her. The anchor talked it off on phone, still in the show with the leather of the national research institute to ask for help of the research institutes of as many countries as they can search for the woman’s laboratory who dropped the bomb down what she made from the poison, and they have to get know why Laurence stayed alive.
	While going back, Katy was considering that Laurence why didn’t told in this show that she wanted to use the man. In the end, it came into her head that he wanted to make her nervous long time while she’s waiting when will he tell it and that it didn’t fit in the topic and isn’t so serious topic what fit in this show. But it’s the next show tomorrow, and she thought it would be better to don’t even perform in it. She will explain something away in other shows, but it wasn’t to her liking to perform in a show while somebody is humiliating her in it.
	Laurence went back by taxi too, at least only the taxi driver could nagging him by her showing her wondering and cheerfulness, and by her questioning.
	For a while, when he was busy by performing in shows, he didn’t meet Delilah, rather when he will have more time for it.
	The caravan was fixture with everything what’s necessary in a flat; in fact, it was on a desolate place. That thing that he already knew where her daughter lived, gave him appetite for evening. He ordered there the dinner to meet only with one girl now too. He already didn’t tell her what things happened to him after woke up and that he still doesn’t know why he stayed alive. He said her that he didn’t eat anything for days so stay him alone, and she is going to get know everything from the shows. He made her promise for an autograph to don’t tell anybody where he stays nowadays. He decided to eat less time to meet less girls who he had to make promise him to don’t speak and shake them off. He could order more helping and portions for one time and put some of them in the fridge later but he became a really big star now, so he should lose some weight in spite of the fact that he is middle-aged. What’s more, he would be an old man about time, after years while he was frosted, but technically and apparently he wasn’t be even fifty as before.
	Next day he gave more money to the food courier than she needed to buy a car, to buy one and take it there. After that, he didn’t already have to listen to the wondering of the taxi drivers and answer them. He asked for and got a dark blue Open and there seemed on every part of it that it was total new.
	He didn’t’ have lunch because the travelling to the studio, being there, and travelling back gave the time of it. He should to lose some weight anyway, and he wasn’t too much hungry because of this because he didn’t use to eat much at lunch. And the most important thing was that he hadn’t have to meet any courier girls so many times. Mainl since that courier girl who he’ve met the last time, also tried to make passes at him. However, after he told her that he was still mourning her wife so he couldn’t make any relationship with anybody, she let him alone. But maybe she only let him alone for a while. And he already didn’t even locate about anybody that if she beautiful, if he liked her move and personality as a woman. He couldn’t even feel anything about anybody at all.
	The next studio was much more youthful: the room’s mostly was decorated with different shades of pink. The anchor was blond there too, but her style was like a teenager’s. They began a loosely talking about what a strange thing can be for Laurence to wake up after twenty years, and they were giggling on it. Laurence mockingly expounded what was Katy’s plan with him. They also talked about he already had a new car so he didn’t have to shake taxi driver girls off at last.
	He already went there and back with his new car, but the courier girl who carried the dinner, was worth as much as two-three taxi driver girls: she also wanted to make passes him! And, after that, girls continuously tried to approach him, anywhere he went, when he got out of the car, but not only courier girls, but in large numbers. However, it wasn’t surprising in a world where he was the only man after twenty years. In a world, where only teen girls lived and in their twenties, everybody wanted to be a middle-aged man’s girlfriend because he was the only one, without the lesbians. But it wasn’t sure because didn’t every girl try to make passes at him in the end. Or not yet. And he didn’t want any man-woman relationship with them. He didn’t know either why but he felt it wasn’t the only reason that he was mourning her wife, of he didn’t want to  dating with anybody either. But he still missed her, also as a woman. They were married for almost nine years when they frosted him, and she also committed suicide after a while, with the other women who were older than twenty-nine, because she believed he also died, because of this damned, particular director. He also was a man so Laurence could at most scold his memory. If he didn’t persist to using real ice, he wouldn’t be frosted, so could go home to her wife, and her daughter didn’t miss them for twenty years! What’s more, if he wouldn’t be frosted, didn’t commit suicide very woman, who were at least thirty! Or maybe he wouldn’t be enough alone against the suicide because of the men lack. But maybe would be less, maybe much less suicide. He spoke also about that in an interview next day.
	Katy rather went to the other shows without Laurence so the man couldn’t have his say in her protecting herself about she wanted to be with him only to be famous. And they didn’t even want to talk each order. They fought against each order by debates in every show, without the other one, about is the girl really that big bitch. Katy more and more wanted to deploy that she tell that Laurence’s daughter also had a similar scandal, but she was afraid of the man’s reaction. But she invented another revenge up against Laurence.
	She decided to begin already now to try what hairstyle should she have on the national beauty contest what was going to be next week. She walked in Lucy’s hairdressing salon, and while she was sitting on the waiter’s chair, she was considering what to tell and how to tell it.
- It’s the next one’s turn – she heard Lucy’s voice. They said hello each order, Katy sat down to the other chair.
- I thought we could begin trying hairstyles for the national beauty contest for next week.
- Why? You have so many ideas? – Lucy was surprised – And do you have enough money to I make all of them? – Katy thought about that only now. She became vague, she was considering a bit, and a solving came into her head.
- Ok, make only one. But don’t you tell me what would be surely advantageous for me?
- Well… your face is thin so I think you would be pretty backcombed.
- So rather make it and… Isn’t necessary anything else, is it?
- At least one rubber or one-two small barrette but let most of your hair out.
- OK, do it! – Katy said excitedly. Lucy thought that’s because of the hairstyle.
- OK, I’m beginning it. But during this, at last I can tell you that I saw you on TV, and I was total surprised! You were talking about you met a guy! A girl met him for the first time after twenty years who I’ve met and who I’ve talking on phone more times! And I’ve seen in shows that a man really does alive!
- Yeah… I’m already over on it. Have you heard about my scandal?
- Of course… You and that movie star always talk about this in the show. What an exciting, exactly a celebrity stayed alive! I remember, I’ve seen him in The Matrix 2 and in the 21!
- It’s not necessary to change subject. I would like to ask you something exactly about this subject to help me to take vengeance on him.
- It’s so exciting, I’m going to take part in a media story!
- But there’s a problem… Laurence can’t get know that I got his daughter to move house to he doesn’t find her.
- Isn’t it a too big punishment?
- Certainly not! He was sleeping for twenty years like it didn’t passed, he got know only from the TV how many time passed! But it can be irritating that he at last wake up from the ice, he believes she still lives there where he used to live with her wife and her, because he read that! He believes he can meet her at last but it’s not so easy!
- There can be a very big thirst for revenge in you if you can speak so much about this.
- Well, yeah, and it seems I picked his total long composition manner up because I always watch on TV his answers for me.
- Perhaps because of the interviews.
- Well, do you know a twenty-four-year-old, black girl whose name is Delilah? I think not, so could you ask your friends if they know her, if not, they ask their friends too and so on?
- How wouldn’t I know her?! We were celebrating her all night when she won the national beauty contest!
- Super, so I can much sooner accomplish my goal!
- You say she is this actor’s daughter?! Oh my God, it came into my head just now that her last name reminded me of a star! Exactly of this man’s last name!
- How much do you know Delilah?
- We only celebrated her because the right thing to do is to do this.
- Did you talk to her?
- Very little, but my best friend comparatively much.
- So you have to get her to invite her somewhere where you also going to be then, you have to make friends with her and suggest her to move somewhere where it’s hard to find her because now, when she is the daughter of the most famous man in the world, people are going to nag her. And get her to delete her address from the net.
- And why should I do it for you?
- I will pay you for it if it’s necessary.
- How much? – Katy was considering.
- For example, that price what’s the cost of making a festive bun.
- OK.
- Do you have time for do it today?
- Yeah! – both of them were happy. Lucy was happy because of the money, Katy because her revenge is going to come true – And when will I get the money?
- Get the girl to write to her profile that she moved house to the new tenants don’t complain about people harass them. When I will see that she wrote it on her profile, I will give you the money that day.
- Super!
	Lucy was still working till six in the evening, and then went to Jenny’s place who lived in a middle-sized, white block what was in the environment of similar blocks. She went to the fourth floor by elevator and rang. Delilah answered the door! Lucy was surprised and happy too. She got on a step in Katy’s plan without doing anything!
	Delilah had long, black, thick hair, round face, brown eyes and a bit thin built. She was wearing a white dress with straps.
- Hello! I’m Lucy, Jenny’s friend.
- Hello! Are you going in?
- Yeah – Lucy arrived with Delilah at the bright blue hall.
- Hi! – Lucy said first.
- Hi! What do you say to that who is my new friend?
- Wow! I’m in o ne flat with the national beauty queen! By the way, we’ve talked some words at the party after the beauty contest, but I think, a lot of people tried to talking with you so you don’t remember me. What’s more, surely many people stop you on the street because you are the daughter of the world’s most famous man! It seems I speak much when I’m very excited! – Lucy laughed and Delilah was smiling.
- Aren’t we going into the living room? – Jenny began to speak, and they went into the living-room by mutual consent because there is bigger space for three people. Then that came into Lucy’s head that she already isn’t going to be Jenny’s best friend. They’re maybe going to meet sometimes because of that much time what they’ve been friends but the daughter of the world’s most famous man, who is a national beauty queen as an addition, a lot trendier than a nice and talented hairdresser girl. But if she will can be Delilah’s enough good friend, they’re going to meet sometimes the three of them, so Jenny is going to be still her friend, as an addition, she is going to be a friend of one of the world’s trendiest girls!

	The living-room contained golden and orange colors; it was possible to as well think about that it’s a rich girl’s living-room, because it was such a beautifully furnished. Jenny and Delilah sat to the sofa so Lucy could sit only to the armchair to they comfortably find room, so she sat there.
- How did you become so good friends? I mean, how could a super girl accept to be friends with an average girl? I mean, Jenny is very trendy and pretty too, but the other one won a national beauty contest and her father is a movie star, who, as an addition, is the only man on the world! Delilah, surely everybody wants to be your friend and you chose exactly my friend! Jenny, what’s your secret? – the two other girls were laughing at how talkative was Jenny now.
- I don’t know, it seems like I’m good at making friends too – Jenny laughed.
- Lucy, you can speak so much like my daddy on interviews! – Delilah began to speak – Don’t you want to be a star?
- Why doesn’t want to be a star?! That’s almost every girl’s dream but speaking much doesn’t mean I’m suitable for that – Lucy answered with smiling.
- I don’t know your talent but it also matters a lot that people don’t have to draw the words out of you.
- It’s good that I exactly chatter so much when I’m excited! – they laughed. Now, when they anyway were talking about stardom, it was true enough that they haven’t talk a lot to each order, but Lucy thought the time was suitable to talking about Delilah’s moving, anyway, she felt like they were already good friends enough – Delilah, now, because we’re talking about stardom, it came into my head that now, when you’re so famous and successful, you surely live in a total hidden place or you’re going to move to a place like that, aren’t you?
- I still live where I lived when I was born; it’s also on a hidden place a bit because my parent’s were already world-famous actors then. I start to experience that girl’s don’t let me alone so maybe I’m going to move to an even more desolate place soon.
- You already were alive when your mother died. Don’t you miss her?
- I was only four then so I didn’t live long with my parents but my step mother used to lie to me that they just went to a travel so I total broke down when I got know that they didn’t. But I already understand that I was still too young to endure this big tragedy.
- Isn’t it bad that this house makes you remember your parents?
- I’m already past that for a long time. I already got know the truth when I was ten years old. I mean, about my father, that “truth” what people used to believe then.
- So you probably don’t move?
- If this stalking will continue, I’m going to move.
- I know a total good place. It isn’t too far from here but it’s a total deserted place. You go to the right two streets from here, then you turn to the left at the store, and keep straight on three streets – Lucy looked for it on purpose.
- Thoughts, I will look it if I will move.
- I’m finished preparing dinner – Jenny stepped into the living-room. Lucy and Delilah almost didn’t even notice that she went to prepare dinner – Calm down, it’s also for the beauty queens because it’s almost all salad! – Jenny gave the transparent, patterned glass bowls where she served the salad in, to the two girls and sat back to the sofa with her own helping – We can stay here because it doesn’t make any trace on anything. 
- It’s total delicious! – Lucy praised her.
- Thoughts! – Jenny smiled proudly.
- What’s it made of? – Delilah asked.
- Only a pinch of salt gives the taste for it beside the lettuce, the corn, the cucumber, the carrot and the radish. The reason of why was it long to prepare, is that I had to cut it up, and I should to take care of my work-nails. Don’t everybody have so beautiful original nails like you – Jenny answered.
- My daddy also badly need that diet grub like this. However, nowadays, when I’ve seen him in the recent shows, it seems like he lost some weight, didn’t even a bit…
- Don’t you want to meet him? – Jenny asked. Lucy swallowed the food aside and set to cough.
- Calm down, I didn’t mean she should be her own father’s girlfriend! – Jenny laughed, then Delilah too, and Lucy tried to imitate them in it.
- I would like but I don’t know how I could find him. He surely lives nowadays in a total desolate place. I think he is going to look after me or already set to search me.
- So it’s better if you don’t move yet to a place where he can find you harder – Jenny said. Lucy felt she must shout.
- Maybe it is going to be better if I will engage some bodyguards till then – Delilah was considering – It’s better if I’m going now because it isn’t too good idea for me nowadays to walking in the dark.
- Lucy, aren’t we accompanying her?
- Let’s go! – Lucy answered quickly.
- Thoughts! It set to get dark and I feel myself in a bigger safety with you girls – they took her sandals on and set.
- Who knows, maybe something bitchies would be quite capable of killing you by jealousy! – Jenny said.
- Yeah. This little bitch was also jealous of celebrities who appears on telly because she is who’s met daddy for the first time after twenty years and she tried to seduce him to be famous. She total reminds me of my half-sister.
- Why, what did she do?
- I rather don’t even tell you. In the end, the scandal would break out again. I got know it from the net too, when I was thirteen years old, when I wanted to know more my dad. I wrote his name in the searcher, and a lot of articles wrote about it.
- What a good thing that you can get know so many things from the internet! Our parents are at least on community sites and it’s hard to search them because who does still remember their name! – Lucy spoke.
- You already have speak about that scandal a lot so you could tell it us, we won’t tell it anybody anyway! Am I right, Lucy?
- Yeah.
- In the end, a lot of people look after my father’s name and they’re going to know it anyway… - she sighed – Montana, my older sister wanted to be an actress in the beginning, but our common father thought it would need too much work. She used to kept her plan in secret, then, suddenly, exactly on daddy’s birthday, it came out that she published a porn film about herself. Before that, she didn’t dare to tell it her parents to don’t talk her out of this. Daddy total snapped, disowned Montana, he said he isn’t going to talk to her till she would change her life, and he tried to buy every DVD of Montana but they already sold them. In the beginning, Montana used her own name so she took daddy into shame with this, allegedly any porn star doesn’t use her real name. This is what my half-sister became, only to be famous.
- That’s vulgar – Jenny said -  I’d rather stay be unknown than systemically have sex with different people I n every occasion, or almost every occasion, sometimes almost with more people, in fact because of that reason that isn’t vital and everyone can watch it too if they spend money for this!
- I think most people are like you about this – Lucy spoke.
- It’s unbelievable me too what a bitch my half-sister was, but these qualities aren’t hereditary.
- Maybe she used to be a friend of bitchies – Lucy said.
- I don’t know but my father surely didn’t use to bring her up badly. On the net, there isn’t anything what seems to indicate that he would sat on example like Montana did! And if people could see about him something like this or if he was only brought her up in a similar deal, he didn’t disown her because she became like this. And if he would be similar to her, he didn’t reject this other bitch!
- You’re right – Jenny said.
- Yes – Lucy agreed.
- And now, let’s stop this subject! I don’t even want to talk about this.
- OK. So what to do? Or how many time have we till arrive? – Jenny sked.
- Ten minutes – Delilah answered. She was almost lighting in her white dress because it already got dark.
- Your dress is super, Delilah! – It stresses your skin’s nice brown colour – Lucy began to speak.
- Thoughts! – Delilah said almost with laughing.
- Will we go together for shopping? A national beauty queen’s advice would be super about what clothes to buy! – Jenny spoke.
- OK – Delilah was smiling – We will talk it over on phone when and where will we go, but we already arrived now.
- I could think about that you have so beautiful house like this – Jenny was looking at the white building what had more floors, and a dark, comprehensibly tall fence surrounded it.
- And a loin statue is also next to the gate! – Lucy was wondering.
- Yeah, it’s my daddy’s horoscope; it’s here already for twenty years. Well, I’m going, bye! – Delilah said.
- Bye! – the other two girls said with each order. They also took leave of each other because they lived in different deals.
	Lucy were walking in the dark alone, considering about if they went in the same deal for a while, did Jenny invent any objection or not, about she’s going in another deal. Maybe, she wants to shake Lucy off to have as much time as it’s possible to spend it with Delilah, to don’t lose her as a friend. That way, when they were together today, maybe it bothered her that she had to care about her too, not only about Delilah.  And she couldn’t even get her yet to move! Or maybe she could… But she didn’t tell her to write to her profile that she has moved! But if Jenny will be Delilah’s better friend than now, she can break their friendship with Lucy because she can lose Delilah because of her, because can change for from Jenny to Lucy! But it’s also possible that Delilah will interconnect them if she will be a friend both of them, but she couldn’t to be her better friend than Jenny, who Lucy could lose because of this. She haave decided: she’ s going to ask Katy for a bit more time to persuade Delilah to move and write it to her profile, and tries to be in a better friendship with her, but at most like Jenny.

	More and more girls harassed Laurence to be his girlfriend but he rejected all of them. He decided to he is going to appear in the last show and to stop this childish debate; anyway, people can know that Laurence was who was right.
	When he arrived at the studio and got out of his car, a lot of girls tried to flirt with him again, but he already didn’t even talk to them, went into the building again like they weren’t even there.
	A long, black-haired anchor was talking with him about how he spended his days nowadays, like it was in some recent show, by curiosity, but the show didn’t continue now like it usually did. The anchor said she has heard that researchers found the lab of the woman who dropped the poison-bomb, and they connected the research institute’s leader.
- Hi Nicky – the anchor said.
- Hi Vicky! – the researcher girl began to speak.
- We already have talked to each order, do you remember?
- Yeas, I said that we found the lab.
- Where does the research have got?
- We got the result today.
- Do you know why Laurence Fishburne is that man who stayed alive?
- We examined the matter what that woman dropped down and it came out that testosterone is what it attacks at first, then the important organs around them. There used to be so much man hormone in Laurence Fishburne, and so thick because of this, that the poison didn’t really went through the hormones, it only killed some of these. There isn’t any other explanation to this. It’s so clearly showed in the chemical agent that it isn’t even necessary to examine him.
- It’s amazing… So the reason of he is the man who stayed alive is that he’s manlier than the other men?
- Yes. In the end, it seems in his look too – it was audible in Nicky’s voice that she was smiling – And what is mo re amazing is that these hormones gradually are going to be reproduced by the effect of love.
- It’s such amazing and romantic! Thoughts!
-Bye!
-Bye!
- What do you think about you were the manliest man in the world and almost everybody have wanted you till now too, because you are the only man in the world, but now it came about that you’re also used to be manlier than anybody was twenty years ago? – Laurence was only listening the research’s result with wondering, and that things came into his head one after the other, what he used to solve manlier before, than now, after twenty years, and now he couldn’t feel drawn to anybody at all, also because of this.
- I can’t say anything about this. It came into my head only now that I really used to conduct myself in the recent days, after I woke up from the ice.
- In what things?
- For example, when I reported about what a tribulation was for me to lose my family, without my younger daughter, I stopped that habit of me that I don’t talk about my problems to strangers. It already, with remembering subsequently this, seems to be a girlish lamentation, compared to what like I used to be till then.
- And are you already starting to be as manly as you were?
- I haven’t fall in love with anybody yet of course and I think anyone have fall in love with me yet, but, by the way, I wouldn’t let her to show me it. It’s also belong to that I’m less manly that I don’t feel drawn to anybody at all, only my wife is who I miss as a woman.
- But if you let someone to show you her love towards you, it also was love between you and her, only wasn’t mutual. If you felt that somebody loved you and she showed you it, you could start to become manlier again.
- It would be very hard because I would feel like she would be a man or something animal, without my wife, so I almost have a horror of this for the time being.
- So if somebody loved you and you knew it, are you going to start a relationship with her, or you are going to feel like this forever, not for the time being?
- If it will happen, I’m probably going to invent something to make that thing come up if she really feels love towards me, and if she did, I’m going to get myself to start a relationship with her.
	Lucy was hoping with waiting Katy at the hairdressing salon. There exactly wasn’t anyone, only they, when she arrived.
- Hi!
- Hi. I’ve looked for on Delilah’s profile if is there written where she lives. It’s natural that she still haven’t moved but if you at least got her to delete her address from the net, I knew you at least have talked to her.
- I’ve tried it. She also said she’s maybe going to move. But she also said she’s maybe staying till her father will find her, and she is going to engage some bodyguards.
- Shucks!
- But I think she is going to delete her address from there, just she haven’t had time for this yet.
- It’s totally the same! Laurence already knows where she lives.
- Are you sure he wants to meet her? Days past already from he woke up but he still hasn’t gone to her.
- He’s said he wants to meet her. And why wouldn’t he want to? Only he hadn’t have enough time for that because of the may shows…
- He really can be curious about what like adult she became… Well, are you giving me more time?
- W ell, if you will get her to move and if she moves before they will meet, you’ll get the money.
- Well, I’ll try it – anyway, she wanted to be Delilah’s better friend, maybe their friendship with Jenny is going to be in a bigger safety.

Katy, after leaving the hairdressing salon, immediately called the most popular TV channel on phone.
- Hello, it’s me again, but because of a total other business.
- Hi! – I’m curiously listening to you.
- I looked after Laurence’s daughter today, because of a private affair, because one of my friends wants to be friends with Delilah and after I wrote the girl’s name into the search engine, some things also appeared about Laurence of course. One of these contained that someone loves Laurence. But not anyone! She went up to her profile today after twenty years and she was born in 1990 according to her data! Do you understand?! This woman is already forty-one years old! She used to live in depression during twenty years because of Laurence’s death!
- It’s not anything. The reason of she connected again to the world, is surely that she got know that her love is alive. A woman lives in the world who is over twenty-nine years old! I think you find her first! When can you come into the studio?
- I haven’t got any program in other shows today and tomorrow. But shouldn’t you call the woman there too? She lives in Hungary and she also has to arrive there!
- I will contact her and get her to come as soon as she can. Just don’t other people find her before it! What’s her name?
- Diána Kovács. She lives in a city called Tatabánya, in Hungary.
- Thoughts! I’ll call you about when you have to come, when I already got know when can she come. Bye!
- Bye!

Diána counted on what is going to happen. She was impatiently looking forward to shows to call her and was preparing with big excitement for speaking in front of TV cameras in her mind, when she was in her room what was furnished with orange and brown furniture, and it had light pink walls. She also hoped that she can meet Laurence in America, she is going to walk all Hudson Heights if it will be necessary, looking for houses with tall fences, how she used to plan it between other plans twenty years ago to meet the man. But he is the only man in the world now, all of them are younger than her so they surely look better than her! Because of the freezing, Laurence was still so handsome like he was, he hasn’t get older! Moreover, now, when he lost weight, he looked even more handsome! – she noticed happily. After years, twenty years ago she already set be ashamed of the man’s age who she has loved, and she hoped when they’ll be a couple, he will look the same or even more handsome because if she won’t love him anymore, she unnecessarily suffer through nine years. When she was twenty-one years old, she already has loved him for nine years, more and more, but hopelessly. And now, twenty years later, he didn’t get older! 
She looked at her profile the same day, if one of the TV shows already wrote to her. Victoria Dawson, the anchor of an American channel asked her through the community site’s messenger to appear in a studio in New York if she can, at the address and date she indicated. Diána was wondering how simple the world’s functioning became. Then it came into her head that she haven’t give her e-mail address and telephone number either. The anchor gave these availabilities so Diána called her on phone, after annoyance because they think anybody has enough money to travel to the other side of the Earth. She already would do when she was a teen, because of Laurence, if she were be so rich! And she wasn’t even near to the poverty, she was nearer to the riches then. Nowadays, she unambiguously nearer the poverty, because of the depression, after sold the unnecessary furniture after her family’s death. Because of the depression she felt by Laurence’s death, she used to order that little food she used to can eat also because of this, and she used to order it in front of her door. It was interesting that she used to have a terrible life before too but she used to want to eat all day, but she always used to do diets and always used to use remedies what had to make her lose weight, but it wasn’t use to be enough that she always precisely used to keep the rules, because of her thyroid illness, she has never became thin what would be her aim. But, in the past twenty years, anything didn’t used to interest her, only that thing that she was alive, she had her reminiscences what she could think about, even if these didn’t use to make sense. Now, when she knew that her love is alive, everything set to interest her again what things used to interest her till she was twenty-one years old. She spended the recent days with tiding the flat’s and her own look up but she still hasn’t leave the house, only pretty much cleaned her flat, she combed her long, fairish-brownish hair, took her eyebrow’s unnecessary part of her skin, put on make-up to these, to her round, brown eyes, and her thin lips and she also had a bath every day again, she already ordered some soap, scent, detergent, dishwater and everything she needed. She still paid on the internet, from her bank account. She used to be too depressed for years to leave her flat, then she would be embarrassed because everybody would watch her on the street that this old woman is also in the world, and a huge fuss would start about her. In the studio, at least going to be cooperatively a few people. However, a lot of people are going to watch her on TV, and she was very excited about this but she very hoped it won’t be a live broadcast, and they will can shoot what didn’t work well. But now, when she set to take care of her look again, and looked in the mirror again, she saw that it wasn’t sure that everybody will notice how old she was: she looked ten years older than her age, because she didn’t really sued to be anything through twenty years. Her pimples disappeared, and people could see her to be thin, because she used to eat so little food!
Vicky sent a private airplane for Diána for the journey, they paid it because of the woman’s pecuniary standing, anyway, the show is going to get a huge receipts when they are going to broadcast a talking with the woman who is the only woman who is at least thirty years old in the world, and who turned up after twenty years, and wondering people didn’t hinder her in her travel to America.
Diána was tensely sitting idly during the way to America. She was wearing her purple evening dress, her hair was had a wave. She was planning how to word her story and she was considering about how many people will harass her then or after the show because they will recognize her by she was that woman in the show who is allegedly at least thirty years old and doesn’t only seems to be some years older than her age, or they won’t harass her so much because they already have seen her in the show so they’re already going to know that a woman is alive who is more than twenty-nine years old, and that maybe there are more women, just they didn’t leave their house because of the depression…
Later he got tired of her thoughts, and fell asleep, then, after some hours, she frightened woke up because she didn’t now how much time she had for putting her hair and smeared make-up in order. She took her curling tongs, minor and make-up appliances out and put herself in order again in panic, then she was considering about how she are going to word also in English, if she will meet Laurence, that what a big fan she is of him. She hoped the man won’t watch the show because they’re probably going to talk about she loves him, and she thought it would be took fast in get to know each order with Laurence, he maybe wouldn’t even be ready to meet her because he would be afraid that she would make passes at him. Diána watched the man in the shows he appeared in nowadays, they broadcast the only man who turned up after twenty years, in every country, with broadcasting some parts of American shows, so the woman also got know that Laurence was fed up with girls try to flirt with him. And she knew everything about him for more than twenty years, what people can know about a world-famous movie-star from the other side of the Earth, by bios, interviews, news and pictures through the internet, beside she has watched him in more than thirty movies, and she already has seen most of movies more time. She also set to watch CSI because of him, but this was anything compared to what this girl used to do to contact the man she loved, till she was twenty-one years old. And her love was by chance exactly a famous, American actor with a family. The grief tormented her through many years because of he died with the other men and boys, she got to know that there is even more bigger grief than she used to feel before, because she experienced it, as an addition, also regard to Laurence.
It came into her head after getting of, that she didn’t know how this Victoria Dawson looked like. Fortunately, she could remember her name because this is the family name of one of the co-starts in one of her favorite movies, the Titanic. But now she had to ask somebody where she could find Victoria! She has never asked anybody about anything by herself, with initating the conversation, only her family, her best friend and some relatives and in very rare, unconditionally important situations. Is it sure that this is so important business that she has to do this? In the end, she m  ostly came into America to look Laurence up, and now she got the money for this. But if she won’t appear in the show, they could claim this money back she got to travel there to appearing, and she couldn’t pay it because she didn’t get it as money but she got a travel on a private airplane, but she already would spend it to the plane ticket if it would be money she got. But is it sure she can do it what psychiatrists and psychologists couldn’t even get her to do it either?!
She just imagined that she is doing it, and her palms already set sweating and her heart was violently beating. As an addition, she hasn’t talk to anybody fro twenty years, without that telephone conversation the other day.
Vicky noticed Diána who was lingering and was feel embarrassed at the other side of the building, she thought maybe this was that Hungarian woman. She went to her but then she noticed that she didn’t even nearly seem to be fourty-one
- Hi! Haven’t you seen that almost middle-aged woman coming in? However, I think there would be a totally huge fuss because of her…
- I am her… - Diána blurted it out shyly.
- You??? – Vicky laughed. Diána was smiling that it was so unbelievable that she wasn’t at most twenty-nine years old - Did you say that seriously?
- Yes – Diána became serious.
- Sorry but I have to check it because maybe just a twenty-nine years old girl passes off as you to appear in the show instead of you, or what… Can I get your certificate? – Vicky also was speaking confusedly. Diána took her yellow certificate case out of her bag. She just saw it now for the first time after twenty years and it irritated her and she was ashamed again of how was it scratched all over. Like it wouldn’t interest her, like she would be unassuming and she wouldn’t want the most beautiful one about everything, whereas she hasn’t do anything to this certificate case, just has brought in her bag! This little case was also almost so reversed like her all life… And now she also worried about her certificate expired a long time ago.
- Here you are, but they already expired a long time ago.
- Really there are on every one that you were born in 1990! And there are the same datas on these, and also you resembles the photos! You have hardly change! How do you do this??? Rather answer this in broadcast! But don’t be so excited you just have to sit down in the studio with me and to answer! Haven’t you ever appear on TV?
- No, I haven’t… - it came into Vicky-s head that the reason of Diána was so shy that maybe she didn’t even talk to anybody through the twenty years. She decided to ask it too in the show.
- I see your make-up is already such a pretty, they may isn’t going to have to do your make-up. Is there any foundation, face powder or press corrector on you?
- No – Diána already didn’t saw it to be necessary because her pimples disappeared.
- Really??? I thought it’s also a reason of how young you seem, and that they should take it off from your face to the audience also believe your age. But I’m going to tell that I’ve seen your certificates what it unambiguously came out from, that you are her – Diána was feeling envy while hearing how much this anchor girl could prattle. It’s surely because of her job. But she was going to speak awkwardly little in the show too, even if she only will have to answer.

In the show, they made Diána to tell everything about how she lived in the past twenty years and why. After the long talking, they asked about more thing too, about her love towards Laurence, she also answered sincerely these.
- Why was you taken by so much about Laurence Fishburne? – Vicky asked after got it out of the woman that how many years ago this love set and what like her teenage years were because of this.
- A lot of things. For example he is the most attractive man in the world about his look for me, and in everything, in this too, and about his voice and inside quality, he is the manliest in the world. At least, he was that twenty years ago, I observet it in his bio, interviews and news about him – Diána surprised about herself that when she spoke in glowing terms about her love, she spoke a lot more. She has always be proud of Laurence was who she loved, she could enumerate so many things bout why she loved him about she enumerated now. And while she spoke about him, she looked even younger by that sweet feeling what transfixed her by the love.
- If you were his girlfriend, his personality was as manly again as his voice and look. You just have to make him believe that you really love him with true love, you don’t want to be a couple with him because of that reasons like the others, not because of that reasons like the others, not because he is the only man in the world and also the most famous one, because this and because of his acting in movies and in CSI, and because he was the manliest man in the world till his they frosted him, or maybe because you like him only about his look. I think you also would like to be his girlfriend but I think you also have seen in our show that it isn’t that easy, as an addition, he still mourn his wife’s death, and she is the only woman who he could feel drawn to, till he is going to experience love, even if only by one member of the couple, to feel that somebody loves him.
- Yes, I know.
- And you have to make him sure because of this that this is the reason of you would like a relationship with him. A girl is going to speak about proving it, after the commercial. She is that girl who found Diána on the internet. Stay with us because you’re going to surprise about who is her! – people turned the TV cameras off, Diána stood up, Vicky went to her – You don’t have to take part in the show’s resumption but if you’ll stay, and keeping answer my and that girl’s questions who is going to come in new, after the commercial, whe’re going to pay you of course. The snow is going to continue five minutes later, you have to decide till then.
- I’m staying – She can get know in that way that what to do to Laurence believe her, she wouldn’t see it on TV because she couldn’t arrive back in the hotel in that moment because it was a live broadcast, and even if they will repeat on TV what the girl said, it wasn’t sure that Diána will watch TV exactly than too, as an addition, exactly this channel.
- Super. But couldn’t you answer at least a bit longer? Or the reason of you’re so tight lipped is you didn’t talk to anybody at all for twenty years? – Vicky asked kindly.
- This is a reason too…
- Wait, rather answer it in broadcast! – she interrupted her – Let’s sit back because it continues! – they sat back to their place, people turned the TV cameras back, Diána’s head was so much trembling again, because she had to appear in a live broadcast, that she also felt embarrassed because of her trembling. She remembered that happened when strangers took a photo about her alone to a group photograph of the class, in high-school, and when also strangers took a passport photo, and when she had to answer the teacher’s question in the class’s presence, and when she talked to her last psychiatrist for the first time.
- Hi, we’re here again with Diána Kovács, the only woman who is over twenty-nine! – Vicky began.
- Hi – Diána said again.
- Diána, I forgot to ask you how it feels to be the oldest woman in the world.
- Always, In every community, I have been allways the only or one of the oldest ones, and this thing have more and more disturbed me – she remembered – Now I can’t to say it’s good when every girl is much younger than me – she was smiling shyly.
- But you seem like you would be of the same age as the twenty-nine-year-old ones, just would seem some years older than your age – Vicky comforted her politely – How do you do it, you’re already forty-one years old?!
- I looked years younger when I was a teen too, maybe because that thing too that any years past, I used to behave at home like I would be in that age, sometimes maybe like I would be even younger  - Diána was working hard to overwork herself to answer longer, like when her last psychiatrist gave it her as a homework – And I was so depressed in the past twenty years that I didn’t used to do any physical work, I used to hardly clean the flat, I never left the house, I used to work only through the internet.
- Was this depression rather because of losing your family and friends or Laurence?
- Because of all of them, and because every men and boys died, and I haven’t know yet that he didn’t, I set to feel even bigger grief than I used to feel before because of my love towards Laurence. Because it used to seem lik I’m never going to experience mutual love – she already has said before the commercial why didn’t she committed suicide.
- But it came out that Laurence Fishburne is alive, and the girl who’s coming, knows how to convince him of your love. Katy Lohan! – everybody surprised of the audience, Diána too. This is that girl who met Laurence for the first time after twenty years, she is that one who tried to become her girlfriend for the first time, and now, she is who find on internet the only woman in the world who is over twenty-nine!
- Hi! – Katy stepped into the studio in a short, necklined, yellow dress, and sat down to the only emty chair on the stage, crossed her legs, folded her hands on her knees, she had a beautiful, golden bangle on one of her wrists and an elegant, white ring on one of her fingers – Before you could believe that this is a so big coincidence that it’s a lie, I tell you that the business are connected with each order a bit. I know Laurence Fishburne personally, I have talked with some of my friends too about him and about his daughter, the national beauty queen Delilah too and one of my friends wanted to be Delilah’s friend, so I looked after the girl on the internet, and there appeared some things about his father too, of course, so one of the community sites profile of Diána too because it was almost unambiguous that she loves him.
- Why did you click to Diána’s profile?
- I wanted to know who fell in love towards Laurence Fishburne because we haven’t know yet that anybody would fell in love towards him, and if she became his girlfriend, Laurence’s manly personality came back – and Katy appeared in further shows.
- I understand. And how to prove to Laurence that this is really love what Diána feels towards him?
- Fortunately, she is also on a community site where it seems that she put some poems on it more than twenty years ago, under Laurence’s photo, and that poems completely unequivocally very serious love poems. We just have to point it to him if he doesn’t believe it.
- Bud Diána is Hungarian, isn’t she? I think she wrote that poems in Hungarian – it irritated Diána that Vicky weren’t asking her the questions. She felt herself so unnecessary again like when she used to met her and her younger sister’s friend, with both of them, and she used to almost only say hello and answer to their friend, and say something in a subject that way to the two other girls don’t know who is she said it to or she said it to both of them because she didn’t used to dare say anything to their friend, just when she asked Diána, because of her illness, and it would be indecency if she would talk to only her sister. Now she didn’t dare talk to Vicky, either Katy by herself, like she used to feel herself unnecessary between her friend and sister too because there hardly used to be a subject she used to comment on something. But there surely was a reason of they’re going to pay her if she will stay in this part of the broadcast, and now the happiness of she is going to be at last her life’s love’s girlfriend, suppressed the feeling to be unnecessary.
- Yes, but there are more poems between the comments she wrote, from that age some of them are in Hungarian, others are in English language, and these are about her love towards him. There are a serious, emotional and an other version what’s mostly about her attraction to his look.
- It’s surely going to be enough proof. Diána, thought you for you were here. We’re going to continue the show after the commercial, and Katy is going to give Diána some advices on what to do for her relationship to be as successful as can be with Laurence Fishburne – Diána was indignant with desperate inside. So how will she got know how is it recommended to behave with Laurence?! This all is only for the show, not for they to be a couple!
	She nervously ran out of the studio while the commercial began, and almost crashed into someone who… The same tall, the same brown but not typical African black skin, the same manly, square face, the same eyes, the special-shaped eyebrows, short nose with wide bottom and arched lips!!! The reason of Diána’s heart was beating violently, wasn’t already by the indignation, and she felt like she is going to faint. She couldn’t even move, just was standing and waiting, she didn’t even know for what.
- Anchors are so irritating her? I have appear in that show only once but I haven’t observe they would be worse than the others – Diána couldn’t even begin to speak. She just heard in live his manly, deep voice she always loved! And he talked to personally her!!! – I’m happy if the reason of you can’t begin to speak is that you’re so big fan of me – he was smiling. He didn’t even know how much she loved him! – Diána thought inside.
- I’m a very big fan of you – she began to speak.
- Because I’m the only man in the world or because of the CSI or one of my movies? – Diána became more embarrassed and retained a smile – It’s lucky for you that we met there because they called me into this show again but if you also only want to make passes at me, you’re better to forget it. They’re going to call me in soon, anyway – Diána didn’t say anything. Anyway, the’re going to tell him in the show that she loves him and that she exceptionally isn’t a teen nor a girl in her twenties.
	Diána was looking at the building’s way out like she was waiting for somebody, than, some minutes later, they called Laurence in. Diána stayed there, looked round, and, because there wasn’t anyone, she went near to the door and was eavesdropping.

7

	Of course, the subject already wasn’t that how Diána should behave with Laurence.
- What your days like nowadays? Do still a lot of people want to make passes at you? – Vicky asked. Katy wasn’t there anymore, she left the show through the other door.
- Most of them already mostly only inquire after if I already have a girlfriend and what like women I like because they want to introduce somebody to me. Some of them told that if they can’t be my girlfriend, they want to see in live or at least on TV a current, real love relationship because they always see man-woman relationships in only at least twenty-year-old movies.
- So you haven’t got girlfriend yet?
- No, I haven’t.
- And because it came to the subject, can I ask you what like women do you like?
- When I still could feel drawn to women, I mostly used to like black ones, with thin or middle built and long hair, the others used to be variable.
- Yes, we looked after your wife and that woman who was your girlfriend before her, and they also fell within this.
- How much chance does have a woman with you who meets two of these requirements?
- It depends on a lot of thing, I can’t tell it but who meets only one of these requirements, or with nothing of these, evidently has less chance to I fall in love with her.
- I think you already think that we have found someone, and not anyone, who loves you and she also can prove it – Laurence was afraid because he had to be with someone who isn’t Gina, with he was happy because the poison’s influence is going to be over.
- Does that chance still interest you that your manly inside qualities can be back? – Laurence was considering some seconds.
- Yes.
- Didn’t you meet a girl nowadays who had special qualities? – Laurence was considering again.
- Only now, before I came into the studio – Vicky, and Katy between the onlookers, smiled to each order.
- Why, what like was she?
- She was much shyer than people I meet nowadays, and also she was more tight-lipped than people who I used to meet twenty years ago. Why?
- What do you think?
- She’s who…?
- Yes, she is. She is the woman who loves you for more than twenty years, not only as a fan but as a woman loves a man.
- For more than twenty years???
- We haven’t tell you a very important thing about this woman. This woman Is already forty-one years old. Katy found her on the internet because she was looking for one of her friend’s sake who wanted to be her friend but evidently your name also appeared between the things she found so Diána’s name too because it unambiguously came out according to her profile that she loves you.
- It’s too much to me. And why did people find the only man and the only at least thirty-year-old woman in the world in the same year?
- Diána used to live in so big depression because she believed you died with the other men that she wasn’t in contact to the world but when she got know that you’re alive, she set to live a complete life again, and she is on a community site too what shows that she entered there just now after twenty years. This is the profile what Katy found.
- I want to see the proof. This all thing seems to be very unbelievable and I don’t want to become a couple with anybody unnecessarily.
- So the proof please – they showed it on the backdrop wall the community site and while they were clicking to Diána’s profile, then into the another community site and showed the indications what referred to that  there too, and the poems she wrote under Laurence’s photo twenty or more than twenty years ago. Diána was indignant while hearing behind the door that Vicky was reading not only the date, but the English poems too out. Diána didn’t agree to this, and she put Laurence’s photo and the poems on purpose to the very end of the pictures because she didn’t want to advertise that she loved a star being an adult! But the man at least is going to be ready to be her boyfriend at last, that way. But only by compulsion!
	After the show, Laurence and Diána were surprised when found themselves in front of each order, in the corridor. The woman was watching like a frightened little girl and now almost seemed like that.
- You were eavesdropping here till the end?
- I didn’t have time arrive back to the hotel to watching the show – Diána gabbled nervously.
- Really you are that forty-one-year-old woman?
- I’ll show you my certificate if it’s necessary – she set to open her bag. She didn’t endure when someone didn’t believe her. As an addition, exactly he, who was the most important person to her for more than twenty years!
- It’s not necessary – he grabbed her arm – I’ve seen some photos about you and identified you because you haven’t change much - Diána hardly was conscious. Her love touched her, now for the first time!
- Anyway, we have to start get closer to each order one day – they were smiling. Diána closed her bag. Now, when she was seeing her love in live, who she has loved since she was a teen, she looked younger then thirty too – When can we meet?
- It’s OK for me whenever but I don’t know this city, nor the country so…
- You really have a strange accent. Witch country are you from?
- From Hungary.
- Once I became a friend of a Hungarian director so I played in two movies of him.
- I know…
- I think you know everything about me what people can know from the internet.
- Yes… - Diána was still very embarrassed. Mainly now, when he already knew that she is that woman who loves him for years and he had to be her boyfriend by compulsion, by interest, he had to be a couple with her, who was the oldest woman in the world!
- I think it is going to be better if I also will get to know you more. Tomorrow, at three in the afternoon, I will go fro you and we will go somewhere what isn’t a too noisy place. Witch hotel are you living in?
	Delilah was talking to Jenny on phone when Lucy rang. She left her to the bodyguard so Lucy found herself in front of a tall, muscular, almost manly girl who was over twenty-five.
- Hello, who are you? – she began to speak to her in deep voice.
- Hi! I’m Jenny’s friend who is Delilah’s friend, I’ve already met her twice.
- I know Jenny. You can come in.
- Thought you – she stepped in through the gate with heaving a sigh of relief, and a beautiful, grassy garden unfolded before her with some flowers and strange trees. The Delilah appeared on the stair of the house’s side.
- Hello! Sorry about I didn’t answer the door but I was exactly talking to Jenny on phone.
- Hi…
- Are you coming in?
- Yeah… - she went up on the stair.
- I think you didn’t come to Jenny now because she isn’t here now – they arrived to the hall. There were small, colorful flowers on the higher lacing of the wall.
- I think it was super to chat on Jenny, and I thought we could be better friends. But not because you are the national beauty queen, nor because your father is the only man in the world! – she her white sandals off.
- Calm down, you don’t have to make excuses! – they went into the living room what was designed with yellow and orange colors, and sat down to the sofa – What will we chat about?
- I saw today in live broadcast that they found a forty-one years old woman who exactly loves her daddy, as an addition, for more than twenty years! – Lucy faked the surprised inquiring one.
- I was watching it too because they advertised before it that there going to be a very important thing in connection with my dad.
- I thought that you were watching it, just something came into my head in connection with this. I don’t know how much would it shake you if you would see your father again when still only almost his look is manly, and his voice, but I think it would be such a brutal so I think you should wait till that woman will transform your father back or what.
- Maybe you’re right. And it is going to be easier for him that me to search me anyway because it was on the next that I still lived here where I used to live twenty years ago with him and my mother, and he is going to come when he’ll have time for this.
- Your mom also was an actor, wasn’t she?
- Yes, and an opera singer, before that – Lucy retained a laugh.
- Were you alive when your parents died? How old are you?
- I’m twenty-one so I don’t remember them so much.
	The two girls talked more an hour, than Lucy went home because she didn’t want to be indecent with disturbing Delilah after she turned up to her without any words.
	Diána was very excited till three in the afternoon because she is going to meet Laurence again, for much more long time than at the studio, and she was happy because she has met him at last and because she is going to meet him and his wife there wasn’t already so she could let herself to directly fight for her love. She remembered that when Gina was expectant with Delilah, she hoped that Gina will miscarry because a child could even more connect them. She felt guilty conscience because of this, but she felt it much more now: she was happy because Gina died. Exactly she, exactly Diána, who still couldn’t even get herself to trample an insect!
	She was getting ready in the hotel for the meeting, she was putting up make-up and doing her hair very long time and was trying dresses after the others like a teenage girl who was getting ready for the first date of her life. She has already had five boyfriends when she was a teen but she didn’t feel love towards anybody of them, she was with them only for getting any experience and confidence. She already loved Laurence during these relationships.
	She never has been so excited than that day, when she was waiting for Laurence. In the last minutes, she was hoping he won’t come today, with looking forward to see him again. She was wearing her light pink skirt with her white sandal and black T-shirt without straps, according to her last decision. She put two curls of her hair to the sides, with a pink barrette; she let the rest of her hair hanging and put two curls of it forward.
	She went down in front of the hotel, and when she noticed Laurence in live again, it was almost so strange for her like at the first time. He was wearing a green, single-colored T-shirt and light green shorts and he looked somehow so handsome in these now that Diána wanted to jump into his arms and kiss him right now.
- Hi – the man said at first.
- Hi.
- That place where I used to meet my friends is very far from here and we could getting to know each order almost only there without people would taking photos, asking questions and eavesdropping so we have to go by car, we can talking during it too.
- OK.
- I bought this car nowadays because I so fed up of aggressive taxi driver girls and I haven’t have time for go to the house what used to be mine, maybe my car is still there or Delilah sold it – when Laurence finished the sentence, they already have get in the car and set for a long time. Diána didn’t even know what part of the sentence should she answer. And she had to answer now if she whenever had to answer because her aim was to get on well with her love as well as she could. She had to answer without waiting for a question, just this once – It’s interesting that many girls how try to be my girlfriend, but they don’t love me, and you don’t even dare begin to speak – he was smiling. Diána insisted on smiling too, to save herself from this awkward situation.
- When other men still used to live in the world, didn’t girls harass you? – she overworked herself.
- Well, it’s sure that didn’t so many girls used to do it. I used to have some crazy fans but it’s sure that there weren’t so much people who used to harass me.
- I’ve read you used to be kind with them too how your mother used to tought you.
- Yeah, but I think it’s understandable that I’m not so kind with this many, very aggressive girls.
- I think this too.
- How old were you when you set to like me?
- I was twelve.
- I was already forty-one too.
- Yes.
- It’s interesting how now we fit about age in spit of this, because of my freezing.
- Yes, it seems that you didn’t even get older, nor your organism, I’ve heard.
- Nor you didn’t get much older, rather only your face became more womanly, it isn’t so little-girlish anymore than on your old photos.
- How many whit girlfriends have you had?
- I have had five friends altogether, without Hajna and Gina who also became my wife. Two of these five were white. Have you ever had any black boyfriend?
- I also have had five boyfriends, and one of them was black but I met him only once because… - Diána suddenly still didn’t dare to continue the sentence.
- Why?
- It’s very personal thing. However, you already also have the right to know it.
- So do you tell me?
- He decided after being my boyfriend for three days, that he doesn’t want a girlfriend who doesn’t have sex with him.
- You’re still virgin??? Or have you had sex with a boyfriend you had?
- Any of them. I couldn’t and still can’t do it without love, and my religion also prohibits it and I still live according to this.
- What’s your religion?
- It’s not too popular religion – the woman began to smile.
- Jehovah’s witness?
- Quite. What religion do you believe in? – Diána intentionally didn’t left any time to him to start to say bad things about this religion.
- Also believe in God and these some things in every Christian religion what I like.
- In Jehovah’s Witness’s religion too?
- I don’t know too many things about this religion but it’s still better if someone stays be virgin till marriage than what my older daughter used to do – Diána wanted to tell him how many things she used to do twenty and more than twenty years ago to be famous but by love, to Laurence get know her, and she also haven’t even able to doing porn if her love only that way got know that she’s in the world. Nor she haven’t even able to agree to take any photo about her in lingerie, even if she hided it. Let alone, a nude photo. Let alone a video during that intimate activity like that. Let alone before the world’s very eyes. She couldn’t say anything because she didn’t want to keep offending her love’s daughter that way that he also hear it, let alone now when Montana is dead.
- How could she sink so deep? Did she get into bad company? Because I can’t imagine that you would play a part in Montana’s moral decay – came into her head.
- I didn’t get divorced from her mother by chance. She also became a similar bitch during our marriage, like her daughter, and the judge didn’t forbid her to spend time with her.
- I understand yet. I wanted to understand it already when I was twenty years old, I wanted to k now whose fault is it because I wanted to tell it to they know that it weren’t you who brought her up badly. When I got know the new from the internet, I felt odd for days because I have never heard or read any scandal about you, then they wrote in a site that maybe you are the reason of that.
- If it shaken you so much that you unburdened yourself to me with that thing that you’re so shy, and you haven’t even met me then, you can imagine what it could like be for me. I am who brought her up, I used to meet her regularly, and she got to be that shameless bitch. I was considering how did I spoil her but never came into my head anything, only her mother. And one of the most brutal thing is in this that she used our family name. She was dead for me already then. Gina’s, my Langston’s and my mother’s death shaken me manifold than Montana’s literally death.
- How old was your mother?
- She was seventy-two but she seemed to be a lot younger.
- I know, I have seen some photos about her.
- I used to meet my father almost only in my childhood when they haven’t divorced yet and when he used to visit me once a month.
- Why did you start to use his name instead of your art name too?
- Exactly because I used to miss him so much and I used to feel I’m belong to him that way.
- I thought it too – the woman was smiling. When are you going to meet Delilah?
- I’m going to go there tomorrow; in any case, I already have waited a lot about it. I’m curious what like adult she became during the twenty years, while I didn’t see her – he was smiling – and what’s up with our house.
- What was Delilah like when she was a little girl? – they arrived and got out of the car exactly after the question.
- She used to be a very good little girl, we used to love her with Gina and she also loved us.
- It could be terrible to her when she lost her parents.
- And this place reminds me of my pals, I used to meet them here. It’s good that I’m not alone when I’m seeing this place again when they already aren’t alive – Diána was happy about Laurence now didn’t need her only for become his girlfriend to she make that poisons’ influence over but also it set to disturb her more and more how less manly his personality was, how feminine, sincere, sentimental precision he spoke with, because of the same, hormone-killer poison. Her family now, already would be right if they were alive: she already loved only his look and voice. Till he’ll have a girlfriend who loves her, and it is going to be exactly her! Her cheerfulness came back again.
- This is that place where everybody used to check in in the exception of them who wanted to go in?
- Yes. It’s already Delilah’s property since everybody believed that I died because I was frosted, but maybe she sold it. If now, she also surely changed the things in it to more girlish things. But it didn’t change anything from outside – it was simple white from outside, there wasn’t any special o n it. Anybody didn’t think that it was Laurence Fishburne’s manly “refuge”, where used to be secret passages in it and where everybody used to check in the exception of his pals. Who knows, maybe it became something all girlish place during twenty years, mostly in this world when girls offsated that a lot of them had to do manly works, with conducting themselves so girlish that it used to be almost ridiculous, and that girls who didn’t do manly works, also became like them because they sued to perceive like it would be a trend so they felt good that way. Laurence have heard this analysis from TV, by a psychologist. Nowadays, when he just woke up after twenty years in the world of teenager and even younger girls and who were in their twenties, he comparatively watched TV a lot to get know this world.
-  Won’t we ring and ask what this building became? – the little girl came forward Diána.
- I don’t think it’s worth so much now when I’m one fo the most famous person in the world, they would harassing me again by being inquisitive. But you could ask it instead of me, I believe almost only in you that you’re going to tell the truth. I’ll stay in the car.
- OK. But what should I say?
- Just ask what this place is, because you’re curious, say thoughts for the information and tell that you don’t need their services now. But, of course, don’t say it with that formal expressions, only if it became something official place – he was smiling. Diána got frightened by the unusual task. She had to ask a stranger!
- It’s sure that they aren’t going to think I’m crazy? – the woman was smiling to seem like she was partly joking.
- Tell them that you’re on a holiday here, and they surely aren’t going to. But, in the end , I can ask for it one of Delilah’s friend if you’re so shy – he was smiling at Diána’s shyness.
- No, I’ll do it – she was still smiling like it would be nothing. She made up her mind no fewer than this for her love.
- OK, and thet in my car after it and we’ll go to something desolate place – he got in the car, Diána walked to the building’s door with trembling feet, and rang. Maybe it’s a flat. Everything set to trembling on her by this possibility. What an awkward situation! If not, that was awkward that she rang!
- Hi, why did you ring? – a girl answered the door who was about twenty years old and she had long, blondish brown hair. Diána almost fainted by the shame.
- Hi, I just…
- Oh my God, I’ve seen you on TV! You’re that forty-one-year-old woman! – she broke in Diána’s words. Diána didn’t count on this. Everybody judges she’s twenty-nine, then identifies her by TV???
- Yes, but now… Well I’m on a holiday here or what, and I would like to know what this place is because I’m curious.
- You won’t believe it! Laurence Fishburne used to come here with his pals to relax! It just came into my head now that you love him! – the woman nor counted on that she is going to be say these – So, it’s the most super cloth store of the city now. Are you going in? Or, at least, give me an autograph!
- OK – Diána was smiling confusedly – I haven’t got too much money for new clothes  now. But if you have a paper and a pen, I can give you an autograph – she tried to smile as much as she could to it seems to be almost laughing because maybe the girl didn’t mention the autograph seriously.
- Wait, I’ll bring it soon! – the girl ran into the store and came back with a dark pink slip and a middle pink pen. So she really said it seriously – I‘ve got an idea! You can buy a cheap pant a half cheaper than its cost, in exchange for the autograph! Come on, It’ll put you what pants can you choose between!
- Thought you but somebody is waiting for me in the car.
- But will you still give me an autograph?
- Sure. I’ve never gave any autograph yet – she was smiling.
- Really? By the way, I’m Jenny, writ it also on it that you’re giving it me! – Jenny Smith said while she gave her the paper and the pen – It’s incredible that the  nly woman who is at least thirty years old, giving me the first autograph – Jenny said while Diána was writing her name and the text, still with little girlish, round words, as twenty years ago, since she has never even written any world. She was wondering that she still could write at all.
- Thoughts! I won’t hinder you already) Goodbye! – Jenny was getting the paper and the pen.
- Bye! – Jenny went back into the store, Diána got in Laurence’s dark-windowed car. Jenny could think the windows were dark because of Diána. The man saw everything from inside, of course.
- It seems like I can be already only this popular women’s boyfriend – Laurence was smiling, Diána smiled back.
- I just gave autograph now for the first time.
- What my favorite place became?
- The shop assistant girl was worded that “the most super cloth store of the city”. She offered me that she’ll give me a cheap pant with half cost, in exchange for the autograph, but I already was keeping you waiting long.
- but you would deserve that little reward. I saw how you were excited.
- Anyway, it isn’t the most important to me, for the time being to have more new clothes. I have to find a job what pays more, as soon as possible, because now, when I already have to pay the accommodation too, I’m not going to have anything to eat soon.
- I can pay the accommodation instead of you, anyway, I owe you because you granted this big request of me.
- I didn’t say it by this reason…
- And I didn’t supposed it but I think you also know that this much money is almost nothing for me, but it can help you a lot and can compensate you for this situation what you felt awkward.
- That thing would compensate for my all miserable life if you loved me mutually – Diána said inside. But she couldn’t tell anything.
- Thought you very much – only this was what came into her head. Laurence got going the car – Where are we going now?
- I think let it be a surprise.
	Laurence took Diána to a so beautiful and elegant restaurant what she has never seen in live. The man paid for the owner to don’t let anybody else into the restaurant now. Diána told him that she was mixed up now, in eating because she was on a diet since she was thirteen years old to she was twenty-one, then she only could eat very little during twenty years, because of the depression, and now she had appetite again, and doesn’t really know how to eat, maybe she should to turn back to her diet to don’t put on weight, or se should still eat as little as during her depression because she succeed to lose enough weight for her by only this, because of her thyroid illness. Laurence also told her that he didn’t eat anything during some days, after he got know that everybody died of his family and friends who were men, boy or over twenty-nine, also, he ate less and that he still kept it to later, now, when he became this very famous person because he put on a lot of weight before they frosted him, but it didn’t matter so much before. They were talking mostly about this and Diána’s trials in diets. The woman was eating fish, Laurence was eating chicken breast, also with salad. They was laughing at how Diána liked fish, in that more meaning because it was the man’s nickname too and at Laurence still liked females, but to eat them, as an addition, this body part of them. Laurence paid the dinner, of course, then took Diána back to the hotel.

Lucy just finished her work for that day and was setting home when her phone rang.
- Hi Jenny!
- Hello! I’ve got such a super story! When will we meet?
- I just finished now so whenever today.
- So we’ll meet at me, one hour later! Bye!
- OK, bye! – Lucy went ome, took her stained top off and changet it for a vivid blue one what was tied on her neck’s back, she read a bit her love novel she recent bought, then took a taxi, and arrived at Jenny after fifteen minutes. They found room in the room too because they were only two of them. This room had orange furniture, yellow walls with orange flower-patterns on it and yellow curtains. They sat down to the bed, in front of each order, Jenny sat on her ankles, Lucy was sitting with hoisted-up knees.
- So do you tell it me?
- I met today the forty-one years old woman who loves the only man in the world! She’s also so shy in live like she has been on TV and I was the first one who she gave an autograph to! She hasn’t even the slightest that I’m Delilah’s friend.
- Wasn’t Laurence with her? In the end, it’s his interest too to become her boyfriend because the action of the poison what makes him girlish, isn’t going to over without this.
- Now, when you said it, it came into my head that she said that somebody was waiting for her in the car, this was the reason of she didn’t came in for shopping, while w met at my store, and I offered her in exchange for the autograph to buy I cheap pant with half cost.
	The bell rang. Jenny answered the door. It was Delilah.
- Hello!
- Hello!
- Maybe it’s queer but sometimes a world-star is bored too – they were laughing.
- Exactly here is Lucy too. You know, my other friend – Jenny said while Delilah was taking her beautiful, pale yellow sandal off.
- Yeah, I remember, she also has been at me too.
- I didn’t even know it – they set into the living-room, Lucy saw them together, and joined them. Jenny and Delilah sat next to each order to the sofa again so Lucy got one of the armchairs again – Delilah, I haven’t even told you it! – Jenny began it.
- Jenny met today that woman who loves your daddy! – Lucy continued it.
- We met at my store, and I told her that your daddy used to meet his pals here, a long time ago, when it still wasn’t a cloth store! – Jenny said enthusiastically.
- You nor told it me! – Lucy was indignant.
- But I have already told you that this was his place where he used to relax and where there are secret passages!
- But you didn’t tell me that you also told it that woman!
- So what?
- You’re really having a quarrel if Jenny told this trifle in private too??? – Delilah interrupted, then they stopped speaking.
- OK, I’m continuing it. So I asked her for an autograph.
- And she was the first girl she gave it to! – Lucy interrupted.
- And she was as shy in live as on TV!
- And Jenny offered her to give her a cheap pant by half cost, in exchange for the autograph!
- Because she said she hasn’t got enough money to by any clothes – she nor told it Lucy, but she already didn’t even remark it.
- And she refused it because somebody was waiting for her I the car!
- What had dark windows!
- And maybe your dad was waiting in it!
- Because it’s his interest too to become a couple!
- Thought you Lucy, I could tell it single handed too – Jenny said, sounding bored.
- And why am I here??? I’m starting to feel myself unnecessary.
- And Delilah wasn’t keeping silent almost till the end?
- She could comment on it too.
- Now I’m who is starting feel unpleasantly… - Delilah laughed confusedly.
- I’m better to going now – Lucy stood up.
- But now because of me, or yes? – Delilah asked, sounding the same as earlier.
- Lucy, why do you want to leave? – a smile was on Jenny’s lips while she was saying it, and a bit of mockery was in her voice.
- I fed up of I’m always only the third, unnecessary one when we are the three of us! When I’m only with one of you, everything is total normal but it seems like I’m not suited to be friends three of us… By… - she put her sandals on hastily and left.
- I’m better to leaving now too – Delilah stood up.
- Why??? – Jenny asked with refused to believe.
- We should talk this all thing over three of us. Or maybe it would be really better if we’ll only in twos. Well’, I’m going… Bye…
- Bye…
	Delilah and Jenny separately called Lucy to talk their friendship over together, three of them, but she wasn’t ready for it. Delilah has decided. She won’t hinder the friendship between Jenny and Lucy. Anyway, she could find friends wherever for herself because she was the national beauty queen and the daughter of the only man in the world. She bought the house already next day, what she picked earlier for herself, at least won’t so many people harass her when it used to be generally known where she used to live, and maybe she is going to can get herself rid of her bodyguards. But till somebody will buy her house, they’re going to guard it. She didn’t have any word with anybody about the moving, and Lucy and Jenny couldn’t reach her on phone, nor I n e-mail because she changed her phone number and e-mail address. She deleted herself from the community sites, anyway, so many people used to write to her that she couldn’t use to answer them, nor half of them.
	Laurence wasn’t feeling anything when he was driving his car on the usual way, towards the house what used to be his house; he only wanted to meet her daughter who he hasn’t seen during twenty years so he was excited. These decades he was frosted, was like if he only slept through a night and he didn’t dream anything. Like her daughter grew up during a night and almost everybody died of his family and friends. He didn’t feel any nostalgic while he was going on the usual way, nor when he saw the huge, light grey walls, the tall, white house, the balcony’s red roof, the big, dark gate and next to this, the lion statue what opened its mouth for roaring on the grassy, taller earth what was designed by buses, next to a huge tree. But it was strange that it was like Gina employed some bodyguards during this “night” because it was sure that he hasn’t done it. He just set to feel now that it was already a twenty-year- later-world, where already there was no Gina, girls, who where younger than thirty, did the bodyguard’s work and if he’ll go into the house he isn’t going to find a four-year-old, but a twenty-four-year-old Delilah. He was feeling he was missing Gina again, with as much again when he got know what happened to her and to every other women who were over twenty-nine and to every man and boy with the exception of him.
	When he reached the gate, one of the bodyguard girls awaked him from the grievous remembrance.
- What did you say???
- It’s such a super seeing you in live but you unnecessarily ring, because already doesn’t live anyone in this house – the bodyguard girl repeated it who has short, black hair.
	So he heard it properly, hits already wasn’t his imagination. Delilah moved house. Laurence asked the bodyguards where she moved to but theyd’dn't know it either, but they maybe would tell it him if they knew because in the end, everybody knew that he was her father.
- Won’t you give me an autograph? – the blondish-brown half-long haired one asked.
- You have no ide either when Delilah can be? – the man asked while he was automatically writing his name to the paper how he used to do twenty and even more years ago.
- She hasn’t said anything us about this, she hasn’t even allude to this.
	Diána called Laurence at six in the evening because she believed he surely has met Delilah then.
- Hi.
- Hi! What was the meeting like?
- Not was it any.
- What do you mean about not was it any? – the woman was wondering.
- She moved house. Aren’t we meet? I don’t want to be alone now after I saw my house again this way. Or my ex-hose… - Diána would be so happy sometime, during many years: her love wanted to meet her! But now, when his personality became deformed to be so feminine because of the poison, she loved only her look. And now, she had to listen to the man’s girlish lamentation, who she loved so much exactly because he used to be so manly… his look… and his personality used to be in the past…
- OK. We can meet as well now.
- Can I go to you? – if the poison didn’t kill his attraction towards women, it would be possible to think he didn’t want to only talking to her in the hotel room. But, that way, why not?
- Of course.
	Laurence arrived there an hour later. The receptionist also said beside what room was Diána in, that she rooted for them to become a couple. The man only could hope that anybody thought they’re becoming a couple already tonight, in that hotel room…
- Hi – Diána answered the door. She was wearing a light pink top and a white skirt what reached till her knees. She already had a bath but she took these back because she felt like it wasn’t the right thing to meet Laurence in a nightdress till they are going to be in a close relationship.
- Hi.
- Let’s go into my room? Because there isn’t living-room.
- It’s the same to me.
- Well, there isn’t anything else here to sit down, only in the kitchen beside of this… - they went into the only, small room, Diána sat to the side of her bed, Laurence to the only armchair.
- So how did you see the house again?
- Everything looked the same from outside as before, it just bought the reminiscences back about Gina and other dead family members and friends of me -  Diána was feeling ashamed of his feminine sentimentalism, instead of the man too, again, but she wasn’t revealing it now – Then also came out that Delilah moved house, the bodyguards, who guard the house till somebody will buy it, they nor couldn’t where could she go.
- I’ll help you to find her. By the way, I think one of your family members could be still alive, who used to be important for you. She has so much willpower, she was capable to do so much things but it’s not sure you would see her again so much pleasure. Maybe it’s better to don’t speak about her anymore…
- Montana?
- I know it wasn’t a good example what way she reached to be famous, I just think she maybe had enough willpower o live too, in contrast to other women who was at least thirty years old, because she sank so deep for the fame.
- She said it was nothing to do it…
- Yes, but maybe she said it only for people’s attention, like the reason of doing porn.
- It’s not sure that I would like to meet her more.
- But twenty years past since than and I don’t think she would do something like this when people will find her, because she’s already forty years old. Because it’s sure that she doesn’t do anything like this now because we would know about this if she did it, and also that I’m not the only woman in the world who is over twenty-nine.
- Rather let’s don’t care about Montana, at least till we’ll find Delilah. Have you got any plan?
- It came into my head that you should buy her house, anyway, it used to be yours, and you can surely contact her that way.
- I thought about this too but Gina’s memory would surely haunt me constantly.
- When you’ll love me, it wouldn’t haunt you, just kiss me now to don’t have to hear this unmanly whining anymore – Diána thought inside.
- You can sell it after this but if you won’t buy it, I don’t know how you could find Delilah. I don’t believe she’s still on any community sites, where we could find her, if she was still there, she surely doesn’t answer her messages anymore, because she became so famous that a lot of people can write her.
	Delilah knew only the real estate firm could call her, when her phone rang because she gave her new number only to this. Since she moved yesterday, she was only taking care about make plans how to furnish her new house.
- Hi Betty!
- Hello Delilah!
- I already have a purchaser??? – Delilah was wondering.
- And isn’t anyone!
- Why, who is it?
- Your father.
- Sorry, I can’t hear it because they’re pushing my pieces of my furniture. What did you say?
- I said he is your father – Delilah got frightened. She didn’t count on this. She didn’t even know to be happy or not, because now he surely wanted to meet her. She hoped Diána or someone else already changed his personality back. She didn’t want to see her father to be like this. And she hadn’t any friend now who she could talk about her problems with. She still didn’t know anybody here.
	Jenny and Lucy realized the reason of Delilah stepped out of their life, were themselves. She didn’t want to be an obstacle between them, and she could find friends anywhere, because she was a world star. So they couldn’t be on bad terms each order anymore.
- Lucy, it’s so good that we made it up with each order! – Jenny began to speak with sitting on her friend’s sofa. Lucy was sitting on her armchair, also with pulled-up her legs.
- Yeah. What let’s to do?
- Let’s chatting! I think it’s maybe lie that Delilah’s daddy is going to be a man also inside only if he’ll be a girl’s boyfriend who loves her or inversely… However, it isn’t possible inversely before it. So it’s total like a changing-back frog-prince tale! Only now isn’t the look what is going to change. This is ridiculous!
- The science certified it on the basic of hormones’ working. Then he’ll feel that somebody loves him, his man hormones are going to come back. It automatically works that way. It’s so romantic, I’m looking forward to see a man-woman love in live too! I mean, on TV because they’re too famous to show up on the street too much… But it is going to be real, not a twenty-year old and even older movie!
- And what about us? We’re never going to experience how it feels to have a guy???
- You want to become the girlfriend of Delilah’s father???
- Who doesn’t want to??? I want to try it out what it feels like, to have a boyfriend! Only lesbians succeed in relationship in this world!
- And when you tried it, you’re going to be happy???
- I don’ know but I want it to know. We may fall in love with each order.
- You like your ex-friend’s father as a man???
- He’s not ugly.
- But he could be your father!
- So what? He could be everybody’s father with the exception of that forty-one-year-old woman. As an addition, he could be her father too because the only reason of he hasn’t get older since he was middle-aged, is that he was frosted!
- So what are you going to do?! – Lucy laughed.
- I’ve got a plan – Jenny was smiling mysteriously.
- And what???
- It’s a secret for the time being. You’ll see.
	Laurence turned off the TV, stood up from the armchair, called Diána and began to walk up and down nervously in the huge caravan during it.
- Hi.
- Hi. When could we meet?
- I have enough time whenever. Is there any problem?
- You haven’t seen on TV what happened?
- I have still didn’t watch TV too much today.
- And it piled up that beside it, that I’m realizing Delilah maybe doesn’t even want to meet me. She could ask the real estate agent for my phone number but she still hasn’t call me. Or maybe something trouble happened to her.
- Where should we meet?
- I’ll go for you and take you here – if they met in the hotel room in the evening again, there was more reason to people think they are already a couple.
- Now?
- I’m going to be there about half an hour later if I’ll very hurry.
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.
Laurence was really hurrying as fast as he could to tell her that many, disturbing thoughts what also came into his head during he was driving. Maybe Delilah was angry with him because she got know from the internet tht he disowned her half-sister? It wasn’t probable. Maybe she didn’t want to meet him that way that his personality got deformed to be so feminine. It surely would be scary for her. Or anybody burgled her and she had to kill her because she was at home then. In the end, he left many money to her and she also could win a lot when she became the national beauty queen, and also he has seen her appearing in TV shows on the recent days.
He told this ideas Diána during they were going back by the car, and she could say only that calm down because if something happened to her, they surely told it on TV what Laurence watched a lot nowadays, and maybe she ‘s waiting for his calling. They were still talking about this in the caravan.
- And what’s that other thing what was on TV?
- Some girls, as an addition, such a many of them was demonstrating in front of the research institute because they think researchers lied when they said my manly personality and attraction towards womankind are going to become, only if I’ll be a relationship with someone who loves me.
- What could be the reason of they doubt academics told the truth? And what’s their aim? They want you to don’t date only with me?
- While I said every girl who tried to give me the come-on that they haven’t got any chance. They think some girls have and some girls haven’t got the ability what they can reach with it to I’m interested towards them as women?
- I’ve not any idea. So girls want to harass you again?
- I really hope they don’t because I’m fed up with them my rest of my all life. As an addition, that puts the lid on it exactly now when I haven’t any idea what Delilah wants, does she want to meet me at all.
- Don’t be angry about this, I’m just saying it you to calm down but there are people who have much more problems than yours. I still haven’t tell you a lot of things about me because I didn’t want to burden you with these, and also I’m not proud of these but maybe I’ll tell you these one day.
- Now you made mo curious. By the way, if I get so near someone to a partnership starts between us, even if by interest, I think it’s honest only that way if we tell the important things to each order, or this relationship would be similar to a prostitute gives a bodily service to somebody, also if she doesn’t have sex with him.
- I see, I’m going to tell you when I’ll be ready for this.
- Anyway, I can’t believe now about anything that it’s a bigger trouble than my problems – the man said, sounding offended.
- So I think ‘m better to leaving now – Diána was also offended but she didn’t suggest it. And Laurence didn’t stop her so she set alone in the middle of the night. Laurence didn’t even take her back to the hotel.
	Lucy gladly took the money over from Katy after she called her on phone, told her that Delilah moved house, and called her to the hairdressing salon. Then it felt for her like time flying till the end of the work, and like she also was flying home from the work. She arrived, decided to call Jenny on phone to talk it over what should she spend the money for. But she was relaxing a bit in front of the TV before this. She sat down to her pale pink, flower-patterned sofa in her living-room, and turned the TV on.
- The day before yesterday there was a demonstration in front of the research institute because a lot of girls think they lied when they said Laurence Fishburne is going to regain his man hormones if he will have a girlfriend who loves him. Here is Jenny Smith who organized the demonstration! – Vicky Dawson said in her usual show called Queer Chat, and Jenny came through the door where the guest starts did. Lucy’s smile frosted to her face – Hi Jenny!
- Hi! – she was smiling proudly, she apparently was enjoying to appearing on TV.
- Jenny, why do you think the researchers lied?
- Well, I’ve said my friend to that it’s ridiculous, it’s like it would be a tale where somebody changes a frog back to be a prince. Maybe a TV channel paid for the researchers to that girls who long for romantic nature watch or hear about how a real love is created in the reality, in the present because they only can see things like this always I n movies, as an addition, in twenty-year-old or even more old movies and read about this.
- Wait! you told it to Delilah??? Because you said before the show that you became friends.
- I told it to another friend of me.
- I told it to another friend of me.
- And aren’t you afraid your friendship can be broken because you said these now, here, on TV?
- I didn’t say her father also knows about the researcher’s lie so I don’t understand why would I say anything bad about him.
- It is going to be come in by the answer of my second question. So Jenny is going to say after the commercial, what’s her aim with the demonstration – Lucy now, just commonly didn’t changed channel during the commercial. Now weren’t the commercials what were disturbing her, and she couldn’t even concentrate anything else. Suddenly came into her head now that now, when there are commercials, she can utilize the time and tell this… insensitive, lying cow how she misjudged her and their friendship was over forever. But she rather was waiting till the commercial’s end, anyway, she wouldn’t have enough time before the show is going to continue, and she already wanted to know everything now about what was her bestie like. After Jenny said in the show’s continuation that her aim, is others, exactly she has chance to be Laurence’s girlfriend, because she thought others also had the right to try what’s like to have a boyfriend and because he was the only one who they could satisfy by him their instinctual desire towards men, Lucy was totally sure in this, and also she told Jenny already that day that their friendship was over forever.
	Diána hardly found the way to the hotel last night, and then she hardly could fall asleep because she was so much worrying about her relationship with Laurence. Next day, at half past eleven in the morning, when she got up because of the postponed sleeping, she has noticed for the first time that she wasn’t in her twenties anymore because there were so big wrinkles under her eyes. She was standing in front of the mirror motionless, be in a state of shock, during long seconds what she was feeling like these would be minutes, then put so much foundation like a plaster-work, to her wrinkles, in panic, with trembling buy the tiredness and by being at the imminent of snapping, and when it came into her head that Laurence maybe didn’t even want to meet her at all anymore, her tears washed her make-up down. It was also possible that he already didn’t even believe the researchers that she was that woman who he had to be in a love relationship with! She threw herself to her bed and was sobbing till her phone set to ring.
	She suddenly was happy about maybe it was Laurence but he maybe wanted to meet her. And he couldn’t see her when she looked like this! Later she realized he was the only one who could call her because she hasn’t give her number anyone in the world for more than twenty years. Bu she didn’t know what to say him.
	She was still lying on her bed and crying for hours when somebody knocked on her door. She ran into the bathroom, combed and smeared further great deal of foundation under her eyes. Then it came into her head that if it’s Laurence, she didn’t know what to say about why she didn’t answer the phone. She slowly set towards the door with being afraid, and she also opened the door that way. When she caught sight of the man, every disturbing thought left her mind because she could see him again, and already she was only feeling the attraction because of the love, and she was also feeling that she was embarrassed because she met him again personally, after so many years of passion with love. This one day gap when they didn’t meet, changed her inside to be a teenage fan girl again, and she also looked like this now. Like they met for the first time.
- Hi.
- Hi. I’m sorry about I conducted myself towards you when we met last time. I’ve called you but you didn’t answer the phone.
- I’m sorry too about I said you that there are people who have much bigger problems than yours.
- Will you let me in? – it came into Diána’s head now to stand aside the door. They sat down to the same places as the last time when they were in the hotel together – In reality I have to thought you for you said that. It helped me since then, it just was hurting my feelings happen to be then.
- And happen to be then I didn’t think about how many people you lost. But it is going to help you, I can tell you right now some of my very odd problems what I’ve mentioned.
- I don’t want to urge you. You’ve said you don’t really would like to tell these. It’s enough if you’re going to tell these when you already will be ready for this.
- Maybe it would be better also to me if I would be over this soon. But prepare for it that these are really odd things. Maybe you won’t would like to meet me anymore after I said these.
- It is going to come out.
- So you already know that I set to love you more and more when I was twelve years old. It used to be so hard to live without you that beside I used to fight for you on the basis of different, through by thoroughly finished plans, on the other side of the Earth, unbeknownst, without any talent, being twenty-nine years younger than you, with Hungarian mother language, being white and too poor to travel to America, I used to try to replace this relationship what wasn’t implemented with I used to try write poems about you first, later I used to make drawings and paintings, I made a board game about you, I used to edit photos about you and about me to be one picture like we would be a couple, I used to make power points about these photos, I wrote a novel about what it would be like to become your girlfriend, I made you be my boyfriend in computer games and used to live as your wife and our common children’s wife virtually, but these didn’t really ease my grief  either what I used to feel because of the unrequited love, more and more unbearably.
- I didn’t even know that your odd things are linked to me.
- I didn’t even know that your odd things are linked to me.
- This is only one of these. My other qualities what can named to be unhealthy too, aren’t linked to you so much.
- It isn’t so unhealthy what you would be mad from. In the end, it seems to be natural reaction if a love is so unrequited like this and it isn’t over. And if I knew it, I could be happy about a so young girl like you were, used to adore me so much.
- But the other things are unhealthier. You also know about my shyness but you didn’t know that I’m so shy like this almost with everybody about since I was born. As an addition I used to dare only say hello and answer everybody with the exception of my family, my best friend and some relatives, and this still continues, just now, when anybody doesn’t live of my family, relatives and friends with the exception of you who I meet with, I’m shy with everybody with the exception of you. I’m afraid so much of I won’t suit somebody, with what I would say or how I say something idiocy or I will conduct myself on an awkwardly idiocy way or I will offend someone.
- If you didn’t think so bad things about yourself, if you had more confidence, you weren’t being so shy. I think you’re only too modest.
- There is something too. Since I was teenager, I precisely keep various rules at more and more fields of my life, these are very complicated rules. I also regulate that in punctually what minute and hour do things in my life, and so long rule-system developed to my study at home after arriving in home aster school that when I used to write it into my diaries, it used to take a whole page seat, as an addition that way that I used to write with as small characters as I could to there’s enough room. The exceptions are at every fields of my life, what I haven’t got any rules for these. They noted this and my shyness down to my medical documents at the psychiatry.
- I haven’t had so interesting girlfriend like you yet – the man tried to comfort her. But Diána was nervous because she told him these. What is going to be when she’ll tell him the other, maybe even more unhealthy habits?!
	After Laurence arrived in home, he decided to leave the caravan only when he meets Diána, and that he is going to meet her only in her hotel room because girls could try to give him the come-on whenever, on the street again. It could be better too if they’ll think they became a couple, just let him alone!
	His phone rang. He answered it and decided that if they’re calling into a show, he is going to tell them that his condition to he’ll appear in the show that they’ll sattle to girls don’t disturb him nor when he’ll get out of the car, going through the corridor and get back into his car.
- Hi dad!
- Delilah???
- Sorry about I’m calling so late, I considered a lot about… if I want to talk to you in your that condition too. But I’ve seen on TV that girls harass you again, and I have been very disappointed in one of my friend so I realized we need each order! – Delilah gabbled excitedly – It’s so queer we’re talking to each order after twenty years gap!
- It seems to me like you would grow up during a day. When they frosted me, you were four years old, and when I woke up, you become twenty-four.
- It’s very strange too but I lost you with Mom. I used to believe during twenty years you also died.
- I’m only curious, what like adult young girl you became. But I got to know during only one day, after ice melted from me that everybody died who I used to know, with the exception of you. After you didn’t call me back, it also came into my head that maybe something happened already also to you.
- Why didn’t people find you after the other men died?
- The filming was going on at az isolated desert island for the movie’s sake. But it was also possible that they intentionally wanted to keep some men’s body for the posterity. I reported that I found the other frosted actor’s body, maybe they buried them or frosted them again and put them into something museum. If they touched us, when we were frosted, it was risky because ice could break.
- This is so interesting! Let’s meet and tell me about it!
- The situation is that I don’t really dare to leave the caravan since girls maybe want to give me the come-on again, but I’m ready to do it for you.
- OK, thoughts! Where will we meet?
- I think it is going to be better if we’ll meet at your house to others don’t disturb us.
	Delilah give him her address, and Laurence was there an hour later. He told her daughter how he lived nowadays, and he told about Diána too about how they spended the time together and what like woman he has got know her, but he didn’t tell her about her odd habits because he thought she didn’t wanted him to hand it on to anybody. The girl also told him about what was it like to be part of the national beauty contest and also win it, to become friends with Jenny and Lucy, why she broke the friendship with them, she moved house and changed her phone number because of this, to they don’t reach her. Laurence told her he was proud of he had a daughter like her, who gave her friendship with them up, in their interest and who sympathized with her father when these insensitive bitches wanted to harass him. While they wasn’t so immoral personality like Montana used to be. One of his daughters had to die, but he was happy about she wasn’t Delilah.
	When Laurence arrived in home, his phone rang. He thought they already surely were calling him to appear in a show because Diána didn’t call him and he just came home from Delilah so she nor wasn’t calling him.
- I have live every day since I was about seven years old like I would be the protagonist of a TV-series, and since I was a teen, I live my life that way that I imagine that it’s a new episode every day, and I mostly think about that viewers who’re watching only this episode first and didn’t saw the older ones, so they get know me every day according to how I conduct myself, what I’m saying, what I do and what I’m doing just that day, how I do and say things, what I read and what I’m reading just then, what I watch and what I’m watching just that day, what I’m writing just then, and they see and hear me almost always so I always take care sure that never to be lame in anything because I can’t say inside “What a luck that didn’t see it anybody” so my life is like a mix of movies named 50 first dates and The Truman show but I know just imagine this but it was so amusing to imagine it, and I have feel later that I couldn’t live without this, it would be so boringly bleak. Beside this, I live that way since I was eighteen years old, that I feel to be mine, it only doesn’t come by itself, and I only at home dare to imitate that sixteen-year-old cast since I was twelve years old, and when ‘m at other place, I imitate two twenty-four-year-old girls who have styles I like, one of them through one week, other of them trough other one week in moving, walking, looking and speaking. But I used to feel that when I would be with you, even if I only saw you in live or I talked to you on phone, or wrote to you, I didn’t try, I didn’t want, and couldn’t direct myself either, and it really came true. When I was watching you in a movie o r seeing you on a photo or YouTube, and when I was watching an interview of you or was reading it. You were so kind for me today that I thought I owed you to tell you as soon as possible, and I also wanted to be over of this sooner.
- Wow, I nor don’t speak that much!
- And am I crazy?
- That your imagination about your audience is linked to your shyness probably, I think, because don’t too many people know any things about you because you hardly talk to them, but you hear what they say about themselves, so it isn’t your separate odd quality so you have one less quality like this at once. By the way, it’s also possible that the reason of you imagine yourself to be the protagonist of a series and that you imitate various move casts style is that you would like to be an actress in your subconscious.
- My mom also said it’s because of my shyness, and I hope you’ll say what you said after this. Something common can be between us that way. That’s also true that I also would disown my child if I had one and it did porn but there are a lot of common between us, beside this. The reasons of I love you are you have so much manly look and voice, and your look also was so much manly till twenty years ago.
- What do you mean?
- You gave up using drugs what need a huge persistence as I know, also to memorize the lot of scripts, and talent and good memory are constracts of awkwardness, and a man’s much less manly if he’s awkward, at least I think it. And when I read your interviews, I like that… I don’t even know, what like composition of you. As an addition, I’ve read how intelligent you are, and I can’t doubt this and your persistence also because I’ve read you also have a degree, and for example I hardly could finish training trade school and grammar school while I used to study eight and half hours every day after school so sometimes instead of school, on average, when I was in the twelfth class when I was a grammar school student, and seven hours when I used to go to the eleventh class. I also forgot to tell you that my memory is so terrible like this, as an addition, I’ve fight very hard at every field of my life, but the results are almost opposite.
- I think you’re exaggerating, mainly because I know your confidence’s degree.
- Believe me that I’m not exaggerating, I’ll tell you about this one day!
- I’m curious to know what you’re exaggerating so much. But money’s already going to be used up too soon if we’ll continue it. Why will we meet?
- I always have time for it whenever.
- Me too now, till they’ll call me to something show.
- They nor haven’t offer you any movie role?
- No, already for twenty years – they were laughing.
- It’s little wonder if you were frosted. I think they are going to call you to a movie, but they haven’t plan a movie during this time where a man also appears.
- Maybe you’re right.
- I also love in you that you have enough confidence.
- But you also have big persistence. And you don’t become manly by this – they laughed.
- Yes, it’s one of my little good qualities.
- Well, I’ll go to you tomorrow, at three on the afternoon.
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.
	Next morning Laurence went to Delilah again, and they talked a lot again. They got well with each order, a lot more than he used to get with Montana, even before she set to do porn. They agreed with each order on they are going to meet systematically. It came into his head at four on the afternoon that he talked over to meet Diána at three.
	Diána just was sitting on the carpet and her tears with the black eye shadow were flowing on her face. She wasn’t even seeing the point of to sit to a more comfortable place, nor doing anything. Anything didn’t come into her mind about the man why didn’t come, only that he changed his mind, he still didn’t want anything from her. But why didn’t he tell it her? So maybe they killed him to don’t be anybody’s boyfriend if they couldn’t be his girlfriend. What else could be? 
A knocking from the door interrupted her desperate considering, but she didn’t even move. After they were continuing knocking, she decided to stand up and answer the door. She didn’t even have any idea who it could be till she found herself in front of Laurence. She couldn’t even begin to speak.
- Hi. I’m sorry about I came only now but I was meeting Delilah and we became so good friends that I forgot about time – he noticed only now the marks of crying on her face, and he became even more sure because of it, that he is going to execute his plan – But I know how could I compensate for this – Diána tried to turn her head away when the man was bending close to her. She didn’t imagine that he’ll do something like this by favor. But Laurence’s a bit plump lips caught Diána’s thin lips, who forgot about every bad things and embraced the man while began kissing with him, with let all of her delightful desires into this kiss.
When their lips separated from the other ones, and they let each order og, Laurence was feeling like he has never seen so beautiful face like this, while the woman opened her big, brown eyes what radiated little-girlish innocence and looked up at him, with slowly taking her long, blondish-brown hair to her back, then let her thin, small lips to smile. Like the eye shadow what flowed down, wasn’t even there. When Laurence noticed it again, he gently wiped it with his hand, smoothed from her face the hair what adhered to it by crying, and very gently kissed her again. They embraced each order and were passionately kissing during it. Laurence didn’t even remember when he felt something like this towards anybody. Any Diána has never felt like this. This was the first time in her life when she didn’t looking forward to a kissing’s end, as an addition, she was wishing it never come to an end. Because at last she could be with that man who she loved. But Laurence pushed her away from him, however it was hard for him too, but he felt like if they’ll continue it, he isn’t going to can help go on with it. It was still the first afternoon in love together, and anyway, Diána has said that she would like to wait till the wedding. He just loved her more because of this too, and thought again of what a wonderful, modest, innocent creature this woman was. As an addition, she seeming now like rather a little teen girl. And be how big variance she was of Montana morally! Both of them felt so much happiness that they have never felt.
Every channel of the world was broadcasting the wedding with live transmission, but Diána was just laughing inside when came into her head how jealous she was inside when she was watching the new English royal couple’s wedding on TV, at home, with her family, and already then the only reason of she envied them, was because of the other newlyweds: because they found the mutual love. And now, when she found it too, she far from didn’t want a sensational wedding, she already would be satisfied with a smaller ceremony, but she was still happy about her dream came true what she used to want when she was a young girl, about a beautiful, big wedding, and what was the most important: with that man who she has loved already then, by true love.
A lovely, half-caste little girl, who took after her mother and a nice, black little boy was born to Diána and Laurence. Diána’s dream came true about children who were common with her love, Laurence felt more and more like he got back the people he lost, by Diána and the children. And the girls got so much romantic nature what by seeing them and hearing about them, what was enough for all their life, and they excitedly hoped further boys will born. The boy who they has had, was this man’s son who totally became a real man inside too, already before the wedding, and he was be the same as he used to be manlier than every man in the world, so balance was rectified by his son he has had, in the girlish world what used to be like that till then.
