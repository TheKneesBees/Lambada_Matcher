About the Author










Introduction


I am Roxanne Rockefeller on the Rock.
I can explain that. Well, I can’t explain what my parents were thinking. But I can explain the 5R star brand. 
I am not actually from the Rock, just a rider on a new range. Here, in fact, for the Fall Roundup. I’ve rode roundup on many a range including: the Biscuit, the Onion, Chesterfield, Fossil Draw, and Mink Creek.
The Rock? Same job, new range.
Which makes me Roxanne Rockefeller, a Rookie on the Rock for Roundup.
Classic: The 5R Star.
Maybe I did inherit my parents’ penchant for alliterative nonsense. 
 Folks call me Annie and as I tell my story remember: everything will be alright in the end.
If it is not alright, it is not yet the end.
Anyhoo, this here is my story and I am, by gods, stickin’ to it.

1  Bogey Down


“Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!” I whisper as I beat my hand quietly on the saddle horn. “Son of a bitch! Cocksucker! Motherfucking sonsabitches!” I wiggle and squirm and pull and push. “Damn, damn, damn, damn.”
But I just can’t get out.
“Damn it to hell,” I murmur.
I am also runnin’ out of cuss words. Excuse my French but this is a situation that pretty much has no more appropriate response.
I’ll tell you what happened. As in so many stories of wrecks, it all started out with a borrowed horse. Sometimes things go okay on a borrowed horse, sometimes they don’t. Horses are like people, no two are alike and people willing to loan you a horse are, well, human, so they may not be totally truthful about their horse’s tiny or mighty quirks. And cowboys, well, they just like to have fun. A minor wreck? Good for a laugh around the campfire for years to come.
So when riding a loaner horse, bear all this in mind, because you may get a surprise. Like my first ride on Bogey.
It had been drizzling off and on for days. Cool, damp, overcast. A spot of sun was feeling good as Bogey and I mosey down the trail bringing the last of the cows home. Bogey and me are trailin’ the cattle along towards camp, day dreamin’ about hay and oats. I’m whistling a hopeful “On Top of old Bogey.”
“Hope the sun comes out soon, Bogey. We wanna stay dry. Not looking like we will though. Good thing yore waterproof. Ain’t fair that people don’t have fur.”
Bogey snorts, “Bbbbbbh.”
“Nice that you agree.”
Suddenly we hear shooting, way too close. Bogey and I get damn nervous…borrowed horse, like I said…so I have no idea how gun shy he is. First rule of horses: never let your mount know you are nervous, he’ll get nervous too. Then he might panic. He depends on you, as the boss, to reassure him. If he doesn’t know you are the boss, you just as well kiss your pretty ass goodbye. No tellin’ what he’ll do but, in my experience, it’ll likely be bad.
So when I say Bogey and I get nervous, I’m kinda lyin’. You see, I may be nervous as all get out, pumped full of adrenaline, but if I ain’t ready to rodeo, my entire being is relaxed. Every muscle, even my brain muscle, projects total calmness. It’s pretty much like a Mexican standoff. I blink first and it could be head down, heels up, ‘Adios, motherfucker.’
‘Course, on the way inside of my being, I am not so relaxed. Not relaxed at all. I’m thinking: ‘Shit, shit, shit,’ but saying, “easy, Bogey, just a few firecrackers way off there. No problem, we’ll just continue to mosey along quietly.”
Don’t help that the cows are also lifting their heads and looking nervous.
“Them cow critters are just sniffin’ the air. Pay them no never mind. We’ll be back to the feed bag in a bit here.” I’m scanning the hills for the source of the shots.
The next several shots truly spook my cattle, which commence to hightail it out of the country.
“Easy, boy.” Bogey is prancin’ around some, but mostly keepin’ his head.
Then a bullet whistles past my ear, a sound you never ever want to hear. I instantly have no problem gettin’ spooked all to hell. Not that I let Bogey feel it. I calmly, quickly, lean forward, shake the reins and tap with my spurs.
“Hyaw, Bogey,” I whisper, “let’s get the hell out of here!” Bogey jumps into a full tilt boogey and we sprint off after the cattle.
We are runnin’ flat out down the trail feelin’ bullets, real or imaginary, hot on our ass. As we pass under a tree branch a shadow suddenly looms over us and…
Sheeit, the shadow jumps down and lands behind my cantle, on Bogey’s ass. Shadow reaches around me, grabs the reins and pulls Bogey up in a sliding stop. 
Then the ballsy bastard pulls a gun on me and says, “Git down, quick, I got this.”
I jump off, mostly pushed, before the horse stops completely. I hit the ground hard, breath knocked out of me. Bogey and the horsejacker speed up toward the bandits. One shoots from cover and Shadow slides off to the side of Bogey, hanging on to the horn and a stirrup for a few strides like a’ Injin. Then, he hops with one foot on the ground and, using the horse’s momentum, vaults back into the saddle.
He and Bogey run on out of sight. I am left behind, stunned, laying in the muddy trail. Gooey, but mud’s softer to land in than dirt, so I shouldn’t complain. I do anyway, once I get some air back in my lungs.
“Son of a bitch!” I grumble.
“Oh, hell.” I can hear another horse coming down the trail lickety split. I scramble under the nearest bush and curl up as small as possible, which ain’t very small, just as another rider and horse shoot past my hiding place. As this dude passes he shoots at me.
‘Bang, bang, bang.’
Hell, a bush ain’t much cover. Geez.
So I roll around and get organized. Damn, my knee is wrenched all to hell. My back hurts, my shoulder probably ain’t broke...maybe.
I finally get untangled from myself enough to draw my pistol.
The dude has already run on down to where Shadow on Bogey and another guy are shooting it out. The dude is coming up fast behind Bogey and leaning over as if to jump aboard. I draw a bead just at the last second before he is too close to Bogey. Don’t want to hurt a good mount. Hell, Bogey’s rider is wearing feathers and buckskin leggings, and no shirt...oooh...muscles. Is he, mayhaps, a’ Injin?
I take a breath, drawing a bead on the dude on the runnin’ horse just as he leans over to slide onto Bogey behind Shadow.
‘Bam.’ 
The dude falls limp onto Bogey, slides off his ass and drops to the ground.
Truth is I’m a fair hand with a gun.
The action goes on out of sight. I hear shots still, but getting fainter.
Wait, the shots are getting louder again, they’re coming back. They appear around the bend heading back towards me. Shadow is now hanging off the other side of Bogey, and he’s reloading. How is that even possible? Crazy glue?
Bogey stumbles and Shadow finally comes off and rolls behind a tree. Bogey slows down. I run out and catch the reins, hop on, and head off down the way to look for the other assassin. Bogey and I go hell bent for leather around the bend, forgetting about the mud.
‘Blam.’ 
Bogey’s legs slide right out from under him.
***
I wake up in a daze. There I am, all alone, just me and Bogey, a motionless ton of horseflesh. Well, half a ton. They say a dead horse is cover. A live horse won’t lay still. Not so with a good horse. Bogey is lying still as a statue. Only problem, he’s lying on my leg.
Is it broke? Hard to say. Can’t feel a thing. Leg totally numb. Might not be broke, if I’m lucky. Bogey ain’t movin’. Shit. The thought occurs in my frazzled brain that maybe the horse is dead.
***
I had done this trick before in the mud, without the whistling bullet, as a raw 14 year old horse breaker. I had the same numb leg and my horse Joe was stunned by the fall then, too. But after a bit he stood up, kinda three leggedly. Definitely shaky. His near foreleg numbed too. After he perked up I reached over, pulled myself up by the stirrup and worked my way to the saddle horn. Wow, was my leg asleep. Joe and I had matching numbness. Fortunately, feeling slowly returned with circulation. Joe and I were no more than bruised up and right near the barn. So, no long ride home.
This was just about two years before I started my adult specialty of rounding up these damn cow critters out of the wildest country imaginable. Even though the weather can be good, bad, or worse, the country can be easy or hard, and like as not, no two days are alike, most days it’s the best job in the world.
***
Riding the wild country is a fantastic escape from all the hustle and bustle of our modern world. No traffic, no worries, just you and your mount a’moseyin’ down the trail.
A cow horse requires just enough concentration to keep you from getting bogged down in all the Troubles you left at home this morning. A good horse runs on autopilot, but Murphy and his inescapable Law are always waiting right around the bend with a surprise, just like the gunshots. There’s no guessing which way your mount will jump if things go haywire.
Bogey and I could be just loafing along, minding our own business, keepin’ a sharp eye on those cattle. Even if they had walked enough miles they had decided pretty much to stay together and stay ahead of us and we hadn’t had a herd quitter for an hour or so, you dasn’t fall asleep. Tired cows can get spooked even easier, bein’ half asleep on the job theirselves. Late in the day this makes for a sleepy naptime combination ‘specially after a long hard morning of runnin’ those quitters in out of the brush.
Even if I was alert to the unexpected, as any horseman must, and Bogey was maybe idling along with eyes barely open, don’t let it fool you. A top notch cow horse like Bogey? When he has a job to do like moving cows, he don’t shirk it. One ear is always cocked toward his bovine charges, even when he’s loafin’.
The unexpected, that’s what gets you killed. A flock of quail flushing from under a bush at your horse’s feet, a sudden sound, a snake, a runnin’ animal; any of those and a thousand things you never thought of can set a horse to buckin’ or runnin’. Now a seasoned mountain horse like Bogey or Spike is pretty used to birds flushing and wild game, but a paper blowing across their trail or a flash of white, the spookiest color, and ‘Woo Hoo,’ it might be a rodeo. Which he will pick to spook at depends on the horse and the instance. Horses hate the unexpected. Flight kicks in first. Thoughts of fight? Not so much. The Chaos Theory is in full effect in the world of horses.
I was lucky Bogie had been so steady in the face of bullets that were loud, scary, and lethal all rolled into one. Hell of a horse.
                                                                ***
        I have been forced into idleness by circumstance. Moving or making noise may shorten my lifespan and my concussed brain? Damn fuzzy.
Thank the gods that some words have been declared expletives. They are but innocent words. Their synonyms are allowed. Funny, really, how one word which means exactly what another means is not allowed in ‘mixed’ company and, in some circles, not allowed at all if there is any other person present.
In my younger years, I resented the fact that some words were considered by polite society to be, well, bad. Bad words! It’s like reprimanding a recalcitrant dog. Bad, bad words! Stop entering my mind. Why were these innocent combinations of letters so irredeemably scorned? Plus as all kids know, there is the double standard of Adult Language. Adults can say it, you second class child citizens better not.
I have finally matured enough to realize that these expletives, however innocent, serve as a relief valve for both the explosive personality and the not so explosive, which I believe includes the most of us. And you can also shock the socks off of well-bred town folks. What, me? Would I do that?
I certainly do love my expletives. Were they not to exist I would have killed many a man, woman, dog, cow, horse...you know what I mean, for you, after all, are only human too.
Let us honor the prophet George Carlin and his famous seven sacred words. Funny, them are seven of my favorites!
All hail the men who invented such a fabulous relief valve! Where would we be without them? And who among ye would throw the first stone?
***
I wake up. Damn, was I dreamin’ again? Dizzy, head hurts. Damn, don’t say ‘ow’ out loud, girl.
Things stay quiet. Seems like forever. Did I say that before? I have no recall of exactly what has happened to get me in this situation. Did Bogey trip, or get shot? Not sure if it’s been seconds, minutes or hours. It is muddy and a mite cold. Where did that adrenaline go?
Bogey is passed out now for sure. Hopefully not almost dead. Many a skeleton has been found trapped under their fallen horse. There’s a long slow way to die. I dasn’t move my hand down to even check for a pulse in his neck, what with the fear of outlaws laying up and watching for any movement in my vicinity. My heart is apoundin’ to beat the band. It is hard to separate that from any heartbeat that may be emanatin’ from Old Boge.
As the sun sets, I begin to hear wolves howling. Oh great, good news.
Bogey and me are the perfect bait. Quite a large tasty meal for a pack of wolves. Yes it is true I am very sweet and tasty, not to mention hot and sexy. In retrospect, a strange train of thought for someone with only five .45 caliber bullets left in my weapon. It might turn into hand to tooth combat if the wolf pack is more than five.
Shit. I suddenly remember. Armed enemies are lurking nearby, so I dare not start working on getting Bogey off my numb leg. I am also pretty concerned about the leg. Is the circulation cut off? Will I live to care? I am truly caught between a rock and a crazy place.
Seems like I really am a mite depressed. I am usually in perfect spirits, ready to rock and roll as they say. “Oh lord won’t you buy me a magnificent young stud...what the?”
Suddenly a large hand covers my mouth. Caught totally unawares, I shit a big fucking brick. The hand keeps me from yellin’ out. So I bite it. Defensive reflex.
“Unhh,” a quiet groan.
Another hand appears with three fingers held in front of my face. Then some pointing with the index finger, which I figure means that there are three enemies about. Then the pointing hand levers me up and goes down to my holster to relieve me of my sidearm. Shit! What the hell is this? Double crossin’ bastard.
 He moves behind me and out of the corner of my eye I can see him toss the sawbuck off my pack horse, Jake, onto the ground. Then I hear Jake jump into a run and move across my vision with the now gun and horsejacker miraculously glommed onto his back. He has fashioned a hank of rope Injin style through Jake’s mouth and under his chin, giving him just one rein for steerin’.
I see a gallopin’ blur as Jake and his new rider head back up the trail hell bent for election. The rider is bent over the saddle. It looks like that Shadow fella from earlier with long black hair waving in the wind. There is a lot of waiting, enough that I begin to wonder if it is a ruse. Has he stolen my pistol, joined his outlaw compadres and left the country?
I am left with only the five shot derringer in my boot holster and my pocket knife still pinned down under my side. I normally carry two pocket knives: one for skinning and other precision work, like surgery, in my left front pocket. The other knife is a coarse utility blade, part toothed, part smooth and sharp, that I carry in my right rear pocket. Unfortunately, I had forgot and left the utility blade on a rock by the campfire this morning. Works great fer whittlin’ bacon.
I hear two shots.
I am still stayin’ still on the ground in hopes no one will notice me. Bogey’s body kinda dictates that. Seems like maybe three enemies are about.
Bogey takes a deep breath and shifts a bit. The ensuing pain brings back my reality. Fuckin’ A it does. Oh, doggies, it hurts. Maybe it’s good news. Pain is a reminder I might live another day. But I truly have stepped in the deep shit and got stuck hard.
At least this guy has left me alive though, whoever he is.
Suddenly I hear a volley of shots and the brush a poppin’. Three horses emerge from the trees and head up the trail toward me. Jake is in the middle gaining ground fast on the lead rider. Shots are flying from both directions, but the horsejacker has slid over onto Jake’s side and is riding on the far right side of the road, shooting at the other two from under Jake’s neck.
Hid in the brush more or less and lookin’ out from under, I hope to not be spotted and rubbed out. My derringer is too short barreled to shoot with any long range accuracy. If anyone comes close, however, I’ll have ‘em dead to rights. Oh, not so much, it’s stuck in my boot under Bogey. I have at least learned that Jake’s rider is no friend of the guys who shot at me. He is the same guy who was shootin’ at them before, ain’t he?
As they approach, Jake is catching up fast on the lead rider. The horsejacker hops over onto the lead bad guy’s horse and I can see a big ass bowie knife being proffered. The knife flashes and slashes around with both hombres having a hold on it.
Then the third rider catches up and jumps on, too. The poor overloaded horse staggers once, then humps up and lets ‘er blow: still runnin’, also buckin’ and sunfishin’. How he stays head over feet I’ll never know. The struggle is on as they arm wrestle atop the crazed, buckin’ mustang who was likely never broke to ride triple. My horsejacker seems to have a hold, but it’s tough to tell who’s winning. I can see as they disappear a big streak of red blood headed back along the horse’s flank. Just as the horse rounds the bend to go out of sight, they tumble off and roll across the trail, yelling to beat the band.
A big brawl ensues and since they are still in sight I stay quiet and try to rub the pain in my hip away.
Finally the bout of knife and fisticuffs sends them totally out of sight. Maybe I will luck out and be able to get this big stupid horse off of me now and find one of the other guys horses who ran off and catch him so I can get back to my camp. I don’t want to have to sit here all night with no food or bedding. Definitely need fire before it gets too cold. Yep, a warm fire would hit the spot about now, although Bogey is still putting out heat. Once I get out from under him, brrr. I wrap my arms around his neck to catch all the heat I can while I await resolution.



2  Lone


Today being my special day, I am dressed to kill in my finest work duds. Hair on sheep skin chaparejos over my blue jeans, my best leather vest over my snap shirt. Fancy stitched boots in the Paul Bond tradition. Fox Johnson style big ass rowels on my spurs, her handsmithed German silver conchos on her hand tooled spur straps. And my big brown five gallon (yes, I am shitting you) hat. Hell, where do they get those gallon measurements? When it comes to watering a horse, mine actually only holds a quart and some. I am all duded up as the party is set for tonight over the campfire if and when I get there. It is so far turning out to be a heck of a 21st birthday for me.
In any case, I’m slicked up and lookin’ mighty purty. Armament wise, before Shadow stole it, I had my .45 Colt on my hip. I still have my backup .25mm derringer in my boot top holster, under Bogey. My skinnin’ knife, where else? In my pocket. My matching .45 Colt rifle is in the saddle scabbard. I have, however, left my grenades at camp.
A girl generally wants to be prepared. But I didn’t feel the need for grenades whilst a chousin’ cows through the brush. Not that I haven’t considered the need a time or two. When those really wild suckers escape and brush up on me, a grenade would sure light a little fire under their tails! But mebbe also start a real range fire, not to mention barbeque their asses. My employer mightn’t nought ‘preciate me burning up their grass.
Of course, now I was questioning my no grenades while cowboyin’ policy. What with the shooting I had just encountered, and the shooters just a long lob away, I had been feelin’ mighty grenade poor then, and hell, who knew where they were now. They could be layin’ up anywhere. Lobbin’ a few firecrackers might roust ‘em out. Yee Haw!
Back in the early 1800s the Mountain Men used to always carry their long rifle across their lap when they were in hostile territory. I, being a stranger hereabouts, just follered ever’one else as to state of alert. I thought we had nothin’ to rustle up but cows. Hence the rifle rode in my saddle scabbard leaving my hands free for steerin’ and ropin’ if need be. Shit, did I pass out?
***
At this point up pops a wild Injin, feathers, war paint and all. Damn, but it does explain the howling.
And the wolf, with a capitol W, enters the picture.
“Lone Wolf’s the name, Paleface.” He hands me my revolver. “I used up all your bullets. You might want to reload, but them three hombres ain’t around no more.”
The wild man returns my.45, which I awkwardly try and finally manage to holster behind and kind of under my right hip. Uncomfortable, too.
“Now, you are my lovely lady prisoner.”
I shit another brick, but nothing to lose, I brazen it out.
“I think you might need to help me shift this horse, if you plan to haul me away to your teepee.” How can I remain a smart ass when I are about to be kidnapped? Am I really this stupid?
“Sure, let’s get this horse up.”
“Up? How strong are you, that you can move a comatose horse?”
“If you weren’t in shock you would have noticed he is still breathing and that eyeball is open. While you were passed out I taught him to play dead.”
“You’re shittin’ me. No one can pull that off that quick. And I know damn well he is still breathin’!”
“Haw haw, I have the Injin touch.”
“If you can raise the dead, red man, now would be the time to show me.”
“A pinned down white person hadn’t oughta be callin’ me a red man.”
“So kill me already, I was just follerin’ your ‘Paleface’ lead.”
“Okay, smart ass, I’ll take the horse and leave your sorry white ass here.”
“What is this, the land of racial insult?” But at least with Bogey off me I would be freed up. I am not sure I want to be a prisoner. But a handsomer kidnapper I cannot imagine. Oh, lordy.
“Okay lady, let’s start over. I am Lone Wolf, pleased to meet you.”
“Roxanne is my name, pleasure. Maybe we could get to work on getting this half ton of wolf bait off my leg.”
“I’m not in any rush. It is entertaining to see the master race in a tough position. Mighty fine redskin revenge.
“And you are mighty cute like that, I need a photo.”
“Cripes.” Oh lord, what have I done to imagine up such a smartass?
Then Lone Wolf jumps up onto Jake and lopes away. What the hell?
“Shit!”
After Lone Wolf gets out of sight I hear a piercing ‘wolf’ whistle and damned if Bogey doesn’t shake his head and stand right up!
That dang Injin has pulled off his magic, just exactly as promised.
A few minutes later horsejacker and Jake return leading a fabulously decorated paint horse who is lame on the off fore. The mural on this horse puts my art work in the primitive category. The paint has hand prints, hoof prints, all seeing-eye circles, buffalo heads, deer, antelope, what must be Spirit symbols and more.
He must see me staring at the horse and asks, “Pretty horse, uh?”
“Mighty fine work,” I say.
 Then I swallow, having trouble concentrating on the horse art as I remember who the prisoner is here.
If he only knew how little I am worth for ransom, he wouldn’t have bothered saving me. Most folks seem to consider a girl cowhand to be a royal pain in the ass. Actually, I am not sure I know anyone who wouldn’t be relieved to let Wolf have me, let alone be willing to actually pay money to get me back. Probably line up for a chance to pay him to take me.
I will end up a’ Injin slave. I am too damn ornery for any brave to want to marry me, which is the only way I know of to escape Injin slavery.
“How did you do that, Injin?”
“You might wanna call me Wolf, Paleface.”
“Okay Wolf, how did you do it?”
“Injin magic, White Eyes.”
“Have you memorized every western story ever told?”
“Pretty much, Kemo Sabe.”
“Ha, Lone Stranger too, Injin.”
“Honest Injin to you, White Eyes.”
“Seriously, man, how did you teach him the dead horse trick so quick?”
Wolf says, “Bogey used to be my horse before the white man stole him. He knows all kinds of smart Injin pony tricks.”
“If you are such a hot shot redskin, how could they have stole him?”
“I loaned him to a white man. White men not being as smart and savvy as us Injins, Bogey was swiped from him.”
I am still down and hurtin’ but not inclined to let my new acquaintance know. So I suck in a bale of air and get up. Hop a few steps trying to find balance on my one working leg. I really start to lose my balance, swinging my arms and hopping like crazy to stay up and then fall back down.
“SonofaBitch!”
Wolf does a quiet Injin laugh, “Hah.”
“Comical?”
“Dignity gone before fall,” says Wolf. Then he sobers. “Hurt much? Here, lay still, Wolf fix.”
After quite a few minutes of first class Injin massage, Wolf gets the circulation going in my leg and hip and I am a sore ass version of almost as good as new.
I can finally stand up only to discover that Lone is a big tall Injin, taller even than me. Not a common thing for anyone to be taller than me.
“How come you so big and tall no how, Lady?” asks Wolf.
“Someday I may need to kick your ass, so I gotta be big enough to do it. Call me Annie.”
“Okay. Annie. But no chance of you whuppin’ me, Injin kick your ass hogtied.”
“We’ll see on that ‘un.” Who am I kidding, his muscles have muscles. Wolf outweighs me an easy 50 pounds of purely beautiful muscle.
“Thanks for the loan of the horse, mine pulled up lame,” says Wolf.
“So I see. Rock bruise maybe?”
“I’m thinkin’.”
“I figured you was just a redskin horse and pistol thief.” I didn’t mention that I hadn’t realized he was an actual Injin ‘til he told me.
“Pretty well describes me. If I was a’ Honest Injin, I’d be pandering to the White Eyes.”
Wolf whistles in his mount.  Bogey obviously remembers the sound. He walks the six steps over to Wolf for a hug. Wolf’s painted mount limps over and we are set to go. Good looking brown and white Paint horse, talk about stereotyped.
“Is his name Scout?”
“Haw haw, this Injin should have thought of that when I named him. Be confusing though, my other paint horse is Scout.”
I reset Jake’s pack saddle and panniers, throw a diamond hitch. We mount up and off we set. Wolf walks beside me leading his lame paint.
“So you’re taking me prisoner? For ransom or slavery?”
“Sheeit girl, I don’t want you anymore. Come to think, yore like to be mean as a snake, and who the hell would pay money to ransom a’ ugly girl like you anyway?”
Dang, he saw the uglies too. “Hey, Wolf, thanks for the left handed compliment, and also for the save. You definitely saved my bacon.”
“The horse would have got himself up eventually, he don’t play dead forever. He would get hungry or thirsty and bail. Though it would be somethin’ if he played dead until he died. Hmm.
“Waste of a damn good horse though.”
“Yeah, but I would have started making a ruckus sooner if you hadn’t warned me they were still around. I have no idea how long I was passed out. And they weren’t making a whisper of noise. I had just about figured they had left. So, thank you.”
“Not a problem, white girl.”
“I suppose you’ll want Bogey back. But will you loan him to me to ride home? Else it’s a long walk afoot for me leading Jake. I need to get these victuals to camp. Where do you live? I can bring him over tomorrow.”
“My camp hard to find, white man never see it. I come get Bogey when I need him.”
“Maybe white woman can find what white man never see, you think?”
“Hmph. How have you ever lived this long with that mouth, woman?”
“Good looks, darlin’. My camp is over towards...”
Wolf lifts the sore hoof, pries out a rock and jumps up on Scout’s bare back. Scout takes a few tentative steps, limp cured.
 Wolf says, “Uh huh. Good. Long walk to teepee.”
He turns to me and says, “Injin been watching you all month, me know.”
“Shit.”
“Hey, saved your ass,” says Wolf.
“I reckon. Who were those guys?”
“Trouble. And they got friends too, Kemo Sabe. Take care.”
And off Wolf rode, you guessed it, into the sunset.




3  Backtrackin’


In retrospect, maybe a job in this particular country hadn’t been the best idea. Probably why the pay is so pure damn good.
Sure is pretty country though, the finest kind of country. Big mountains, steep enough to pucker up your ass cheeks whilst riding across steep seemingly bottomless slopes on frozen ice slick ground, sidehilling on tiny tilted cow trails gathering cows. Country with beautiful pine, spruce and aspen forests on the high flanks; and sagebrush in the valleys. Country that grows fat calves on plentiful grass. Country I was thinkin’ I could peacefully settle down in afore it had got fractious a few moments back. So much for peace and quiet.
We had started out a force of 25 cowhands hired to round up a couple thousand head of ornery longhorn cattle. Their summer range encompasses round about 40,000 acres of pure damn wild country. We had searched for cows, calves and bulls. Well over 2000, in fact, as a cow and her new calf are counted as one pair rather than two animals. And most of the cows hopefully have a calf by their side. The lease is for 2000 cows. Calves being born into that year are not counted, and the calves are the money end of the operation. Fifty bulls fall on top of that too, as their job is creating those money making calves. No plan of the prime purebred bulls becoming meat.
Anyhow we had made a bunch of figurative circles through the numerous canyons, filled with sage brush in the dry bottoms and willow brush, thick and tough to ride through, in the creek bottoms. Up high, lodgepole pine and Doug fir for forest, speckled with quakies, our name for quaking aspen, in thickets. Beautiful on the outside but dark, nasty, twisted pecker pole mazes on the inside. We had rode over and looked at each square foot of the whole country in the course of about a month. A lot of it twice or thrice.
So thick are the groves of quakies that the sun seems to almost not penetrate. However, a more beautiful sight you will not see than the fall color of the aspen leaf. Yeller, orange, bright pure red, even a lovely mauve, every tree having its own varying and unique shades of beauty, and the super hardy trees still showing quite a bit of bright green, even after the early frosts, though not for long. Truly a pure color mosaic for my hungry eyes. We would even find cattle clear up in the high mountaintops above the tree line, aforagin’ for the alpine feed.
Each pair or so of us cowhands did a half day or day long circle of our allotted share of this range, follerin’ the orders of the Ramrod. We brought our cattle bunches together day by day in a larger and larger gather. Generally we could get them into a big canyon where they would settle and graze and loaf overnight until our morning return. If they didn’t settle we would leave a couple of hands to ride nighthawk and serenade.
After we had the most of them found, we circled them loosely up and sorted out each rancher’s stock in order to get them to their respective home ranches. We split up and delivered each cattleman’s bunch or several ranches’ brands together, if their ranches were in the same direction. All through the gather we had a continuing loss of a few mavericks who would quit the herd and head for the brush. They would hightail it when they thought no one was looking, and by golly if we weren’t lookin’ or our mount hesitated a half a step, they were gone! No brush, however thick or prickly, would stop them. They just knew that there was some grass they needed to get et up before shippin’ out. Also, they figured hiding in the brush would save them from us boogedy bears. They surely had no liking for losin’ their freedom to roam.
Just the pure love of being wild and free up in that open country, few fences and hardly ever a human to bother their pastoral lifestyle, who wouldn’t warm up to that idea? I sure was thinkin’ hard on it. My kind of lonesome land. No one to tell you what to do, just the whisper of the aspen leaves in the breeze. This was my first trip to the Rock and it was more than pleasing to my eyes. Better than I could have even imagined. Hell, peopled with good lookin’ cowboys to boot.
After all the cattle we had gathered and range cut were delivered to be sorted between being shipped to market or moved to winter range, we back rode for the laggards for another 14 days. Some days it is the thankless job of the cowboy: low wages, nasty weather, worse weather, rough terrain, ornery critters, and occasionally contrary horses.
Main gather done, the Ramrod sent most all of the hands home. I was alone, crossing the range for one last ride on my spare horse, Bogey. My partner, Michael, had split out the other direction this morning doing a circle of his own. Michael was a seasoned hand. I grew up in ranchin’, but both he and myself were rookies on this range.
My main equine partner was Spike. A cowhand generally had two or three steady mounts and a couple half broke cayuses for a job like this. Dependin’ on their age and physical condition, each one had a half or full days rest on a regular basis, this being long hours of work in rough terrain.
Life doesn’t always go according to plan. Seriously, does it ever go according to plan?
I seem to be too cold to think straight.
I pull into camp after too long a ride over hill and canyon in the pitch dark, what with the clouds and pouring rain obscuring the full moon I had hoped to use to see. I am cold, wet, shiverin’, and hypothermic. Horses have fur and live outside, so Bogey is warm, comfy and in his element, as he is in most any weather. And like all horses, he always knows the way home. Which is good, ‘cause he’s been in the driver’s seat. I am just a’ hangin’ on.
“Damn, a hot fire’s gonna feel good, old horse.”
Bogey just nods. Nice thing about talkin’ to your animals, they never talk back. Don’t know if you ever noticed; when a horse walks, his head nods continually up and down. It’s him sayin’, ‘Yes, ma’am, I agree, whatever you say.’ He’s the best.
Fortunately, Bogey has been sending some much appreciated horse heat up my way on the ride. Getting off and leaving that horse heat with no fire built and chores to do was gonna be tough. Usually we had banked up coals left in the pit, but the rain had snuck in on us and fixed that.
I slide off old Bogey and...“Shit!”...crash all the way down to the dirt. My bruised and beaten body has stiffened up considerable during the long ride. By the time I unsaddle, grain and turn Bogey loose, I have regained not my pride but at least my composure. I limp and gimp over to the fire pit intent on heat, shelter from the rain and a warm meal.
I am getting out my matches with numb fingers when I hear hoof beats.



4  Compadres


Fortunately I have a hot, dry buddy to warm my bones, who I see is just pullin’ in to camp. When I can be sure it’s him, I holster my sidearm.
“Hey, compadre!”
“I’d have shot you if I hadn’t recognized Boot’s blaze in the firelight.”
“I’d a’ shot back, young lady.”
“Good thing you can’t hit the side of a barn, Michael.”
“Hey, just ‘cause I’m swish don’t mean I can’t hit the bulls eye. In fact, it means I get more practice.”
“At what?”
“Hitting my target.” Michael flips his wrist and his bangs. What a partner. Well, one of us needs to be ultra-feminine, might as well be Michael, he’s a natural. He may be gay, but it don’t make him any less of a top hand. He’s all cowboy at work.
After seeing to his horse, Michael saunters over to the fire and gets a good look at my cold, sorry, bruised up person. “What the hell happened to you? You look like a tree fell on you and knocked you in the creek. You’re shivering.
“I’ll start a fire and heat the stew You go get those wet clothes off, find some blankets and wrap up.”
During a celebration of life with a shot of medicinal pain killer, I tell Michael what took place with the shooters and Wolf, the amazing life saver. 
Michael informs me, “I ran into three cows and a bull just over that last ridge and run them in. Must have been the bunch you lost.”
“Did you hear the commotion?”
“Not a sound.”
“You were likely singin’ one a them off tune cowboy songs and missed it all.”
“Off tune?”
I laugh and say, “Yep.” Actually Michael is the lead singer in a hoppin’ cowboy band. Way good singer.
“Back to my story. Wolf is big, good looking and does a first class job of painting a pony. Tight little ass on him too.”
“Oh sweetie, that means he’s gotta be married. What man can paint a pony up real pretty and not have been caught by a woman?”
“Is everyone I know a smartass?”
“Pretty much, girlfriend. Have yourself some stew.”
After a bowl or three of stew, and a few more medically indicated shots, we curl into our bedrolls. We are heated by the coals. I am mostly dry and starting to warm up some. We snuggle up in our fire warmed lean-to for the duration.



5  Mañana


We are sound asleep, me nicely warmed by Michael’s body heat. We had been cuddling like lovers, ha-ha, well at least best friends, all night. Actually, I ain’t had nothing twixt my thighs but my fingers, hell, nigh on a year. But Michael and I have once again proven that the only sure backwoods cure for hypothermia is warm naked cuddlers sharing a sleeping bag. I am warm as toast at last. I drift back off to sleep.
“White Eyes, wake it up!”
Michael and I spring up, weapons drawn from under our saddles. We use ‘em fer pillows. Saddles with guns underneath, comfy.
“Holy shit, Lone Wolf, you ever heard of ‘halloing’ the camp? We coulda shot you,” I say.
“Yeah, if you had heard me comin’. Red man very stealthy.”
“It’s too early, couldn’t you wait ‘til sunup?”
“Look, lady, who is this dude, your husband?”
“I’d rather be your husband, handsome,” says Michael.
“Why he in same blankets as you if not husband? Him shape changer?”
“No, him more like sex changer or some such. If you stand too close his flipping wrist will break your nose.” I really think I am funny.
And to Michael I say, “Geez, Michael, I know you aren’t one to hide in the closet, but did you ever think maybe you’ll declare your undying love for this blood thirsty redskin and he’ll turn out to be a gay basher and knife you?”
“And you think saying this in front of long, tall and handsome here is politic?” says Michael.
“He maybe knifed three guys yesterday, saving my bacon. Maybe he also don’t like gays.”
“In fact, Annie, Native American people are known for their tolerance of gays,” declares Michael.
“Only in Little Big Man, Michael. This is real life, not Hollywood history.”
“Hey kids, red man standing right here. And saving your bacon was a coincidence, they maybe needed killing. But then maybe they actually left the country before I got around to killing them. If I had killed them, it wouldn’t have been for you. My buddy Bogey was in danger.”
“Gotta love a man who puts his horse first.” I smile and bat my eyes. “Lone Wolf, meet Michael, my partner.”
“How, white man.”
“Pleasure, handsome.”
“You come over to get your nag, Wolf?” I ask.
“I come to make you my woman, if Mr. Michael here will allow it.”
“Oh shit, Wolf, it isn’t a case of letting. Annie runs her own life.” Michael always defends me, like I need it. “She’d knock me flat if I tried to tell her anything. You don’t know Annie if you think she would be anyone’s woman.”
“Mr. Michael?” I say. “You make him sound like some high falutin’ big city hair salon artiste.”
Wolf looks at me. “White woman, I need a woman to catch a rat. I need one who is mean as a snake and not too smart. You seem to fit that description.”
“She’ll do it,” says Michael.
“Michael, you just said you would never tell me what to do.”
“I ain’t tellin’, I’m volunteerin’ you. This nice lookin’ feller needs a woman. Mean, not smart. It’s you to a tee. Plus, you’re the only woman here.”
“Men!”
So, unbeknownst to us, thus began one of the great collaborations of our time.
***
Breakfast is bacon, eggs, and biscuits with great coffee. All are as delicious as advertised. We eat with the gusto of those who have lived to see another day, no time to talk between mouthfuls. Just savor.
We admire the creek, the forest and our tidy camp. After a rest to digest we start thinking on our future.
Curiosity gets the better of me. “Hey Wolf, who were those guys you run off or was it just plain offed yesterday? Why were you fightin’ them?”
“Hell no. I wasn’t fightin’ them. They were shootin’ at each other and everything else they saw. As far as this Injin could tell, none of them could hit the side of a barn. I just run in to help y...uh, Bogey. Damn good horse, he stayed right down to my whistle in all that commotion. I got you to lay still, then I got shed of them.”
“Any idea what they were shootin’ over?”
“Injin business.”
“I finally get a paragraph out of you then you clam up.”
“I can handle it, don’t need no help.”
“Hey, if you do need help, remember, I like danger. I live for danger.”
‘Bang. Bang. Bang.’
“Shit, duck, this sounds dangerous.” Okay, maybe I don’t live for danger.
“Yeah, you should know,” says Wolf.
“Again,” I say.
 “This is getting old,” says Wolf. Then he sneaks a peek.
‘Bang.’ Another shot.
“Shit! Fuckin’ bushwhackers, still out there.”
After we hit the dirt, run for cover and all that, it quiets down and we eventually decide that the potshotter has hit the road.
“I’ll go check for sign,” Wolf offers.
We reconnoiter and all we discover is that Wolf’s hat has a nice clean hole, clear through just above his skull. The bullet actually clipped off a few black head hairs. It seems that we are in the fight whether any of us like it or not. It has become our business, too, as far as the bad guys figure, for certain sure.
“You sure there is no story here, Wolf?”
“You white folks will think I am a crazy Injin.”
I laugh.
“Seriously, Annie. You might think I’m mad. I’d of questioned your judgment if you didn’t.”
“Hell Lone, I already suspected it. When I saw you hanging off a horse and firing my six shooter under his neck, twice.”
“Yesterday was a sure ‘nough venture into the stinky black swamp of life,” replies Wolf.
“You fit right in with the rest of us crazies. We’re all here ‘cause we don’t really fit in in town. Don’t actually want to either,” says Michael. “I had a heck of a time trying to get out of the closet back in the city. I never did, too many scary gay bashers. But as soon as I figured out I really didn’t want to be a straight man and a law dog no less, I went over the edge. According to my ‘friends’ at least. I ditched that life, followed my childhood dream and become a cowhand.
“Cowboys, I found, don’t care whether I am brown or white, straight or gay, wearing a kilt or cowboy boots. All they care about is that I pull my weight. And supply a few laughs along the way. For a cowhand the only virtues are patience, tolerance and humility. Thank the gods my momma got me horse riding lessons as a kid. Saved my bacon. Woman was a saint.”
“Mother worship. Yep, yore gay,” I say. A girl’s gotta see the humor in life.



6  The Rock


Actually, they ain’t much in the way of old paper bound books nowadays, what with the book burnings and general massive destruction in the times of Troubles, but the moniker has stuck around. My saddlebags are full of all the important cowboy info that I have picked up and scribbled down in my travels around the Cosmos. Most have come down passed by word of mouth. But the story goin’ around these days is that a recorded history exists. Books or such. There is still a few about, they say.
The Hollywood journals have been the subject of much speculation since the Troubles which pretty much blew the world as our ancestors knew it clear to hell. Or as my Great Grand pappy used to say, ‘Earth went to hell in a starship and never come back.’
Fortunately, the Troubles didn’t get real bad until after mankind had moved out into the galaxies and terraformed a shitload of planets. Some of Earthkind figured out that the shit was hitting the fan and blasted out to new frontiers. Some planets were colonized by the government. Then what they did was send unwanted criminals (being killers, murderers, rapists, druggers, rebels, anyone who disagreed with their politics and all of them what didn’t fit into their idea of advanced and enlightened civilization) off in flying space boats to the less desirable worlds, as had governments on Earth past sent their criminals to empty continents. Cheaper than penning them up in prisons and feeding and guarding them.
What with all the shooting and bombs and killin’, not many folks survived. We were left with most of our information, libraries, web centers, cities being gone, towns too. Hell, history was lost.
But then as things got more organized on the new planets where the oldsters had moved after the destruction of Earth, folks began to use their minds to bring the past back to life. Families would sit and reminisce around the campfire and tell all they had heard from the ancient stories told by the oldsters. People finally got to the point that societies could support scribers to listen, remember, and start writing again, getting what we was left of human knowledge scribbled down.
I myself have spent many a night around the campfire listenin’ to the stories of how my 19th century heroes lived and worked. I am fascinated with the Taming of the West. My people way back then took a big part in the whole deal, bein’ cowboys and cattlemen theirselves. Trappin’, rounding up wild cows, driving huge herds of cattle acrost continents to settle new land, huntin’, homesteadin’, and gen’rally livin’ a hard fought life in a tough primitive world where your scalp was nary more than a trophy to the local folk.
And my partner Michael is a kindred spirit.
When Michael and I heard about the Rock, with not too many people and a whole passel of cowboys and cattle work, we was itching to join up. We were ready for new country and this sounded like a place worth checkin’ out. So we worked a season, saved up some travelin’ money and signed on for the wilderness roundup.
The Rock was built by outsiders, by people who came from someplace else giving the best of theirselves, hoping to make this the greatest planet in the Cosmos.
Rock folks may or may not have a lot of book learnin’, eddication being every person’s private choice.
Here on the Rock we are reliving the Old West. With the wilderness rules we have to conquer many of the same obstacles raising the cattle and living a fairly, for our time, primitive existence. ‘Course once we drive the herds to the transport centers, like the MadDog town on the coast, we exit the edge of the wilderness and move into more modern space transport. Not that we see very modern anything very often, being out here at the edge of the Cosmos, light years from the central supply lines.
On the flip side of the coin is the Center, the Center of the Cosmos and the center of the Centrist government. Now, ‘they’ say, everyone can enjoy the comfort and enlightenment of Centrist Civilization.
Savage outer planets are considered not so enlightened since we refuse Centrist control.
Centrists are in the Center, the middle of the road and the center of the Cosmos, claiming to have finally accomplished what the donkeys and elephants had clamored to do in the 21st century. They call it peace and prosperity. We call it mind control and total domination by the Centrist overlords. It is a puppet theater the ‘Benevolent Council’ foists on the unsuspecting public.
The philosophical question?
Civilization: Good, bad or ugly?
***
After a reconnoiter, Wolf returns. “Shootin’s over, I’ll make more coffee. White man always screw it up.”
“I’ll let it slide this time cutie, but next time I will prove beyond a doubt that gay men make the best coffee.” Michael conceited? Not much.
What an egotistical duo they make.
“Hell boys,” I say. “We gotta beat cleats. Forget the coffee.”
“You still need Bogey?”
I grin and say, “Naw, I got a polite horse who won’t fall on my leg.”
Michael and I walk out into the grassy park and whistle up our horses. While we saddle up we ponder on the events of yesterday.
“We are headed out to move those cows that got spooked by the shooters yesterday.”
“That fall probably saved your life, and yore leg is mostly just fine,” ventures Wolf. “That bullet whistled right over the top of you and likely hit a tree. I’da had time to have recovered the lead, melted it and recast the bullet while you were napping there.”
“You were there?”
“Yep, after I hit the dirt I lay still, but no one seemed to be in sight so I crawled away from the trail and circled down to where you were layin’.”
“How long was I out?”
“Long enough for them boys to almost get away,” says Wolf. “I got there in time to shut you up, so they didn’t hear you moving and realize they hadn’t killed you. If they do figure out you survived, they might want to finish the job.”
“What the heck are they up to that they are feeling the need to kill off innocent cowpokes?”
“Maybe they are not too smart, don’t realize you were minding your own business,” says Michael. “When folks are up to no good they can get mighty suspicious of everyone around.”
“Yep, make even a’ Injin nervous about being out and about. My day will be spent backtrackin’ these rubes, see where they came from and where they were headed. Too bad someone drove a herd of cattle right down the trail and covered their tracks so good.”
“Hey, you Injins are supposed to be top notch trackers. Not to mention that their horses are likely shod, and Bogey ain’t.”
“So you saw their sign yesterday?”
“Some, here and there along the way. Bein’ behind the cows myself, I only saw an occasional bit of a track, but I first spotted the traffic about two miles below where you run in and tried to scalp me.”
“Shit, lady, if I’da been scalpin’ you’d be a slick skulled squealin’ pig today. Wolf finish any job him start.”
“And I mightily appreciate yore not takin’ it, I’m pure damn fond of this fine scalp. It is beautiful and keeps my head parts warm to boot,” I say. My lapses into cowboy rhetoric seemed to be spawned by Wolf’s Injin brief speak. We make a complimentary pair. And, by the by, he is still hot. My girlie parts is a tinglin’.
“Thanks for the ‘loan’ of Bogey, Wolf. And the savin’ of my neck yesterday.
“And my ‘hardly hurt’ leg hurts like a son of a bitch, thanks for asking.”
Wolf laughs and rides off, ponying Bogey.
Michael and I continue on out into the draw.
“Oh, sweetie, I have died and gone to heaven! That hottie is the man of my dreams. I will never want another,” say I.
“I’ll bet he is sooo buff under those buckskins,” says Michael.
“No freakin’ way, Michael. You just hold your horses buddy, that Injin isn’t gay. He is without a doubt my dream lover.”
“He was making eyes at me all through breakfast, sweetie.”
“He was staring at you flouncing around the fire, flaming to beat the band. And I do mean you flaming, not the fire. He likely never saw such a display, bein’ a’ uneducated backwoods savage.” Just going with the fantasy out loud there.
Unable to resolve our dispute over the man of our mutual dreams, we hit the draw and head out to get that boogery bunch of cows that I had lost and Michael had found yesterday.



7  Meet


Now where my big wreck had took place was about halfway down the big creek known, no shit, as Dead Horse Draw. If I believed in coincidences I’d a’ been even more worried yesterday.
Dead Horse runs for a few miles from the high top snowy mountains down to the small pasture where we put our daily gathers. Now with the small lots we are picking up on the back rides, time permitting, we move them on through the small pasture into the corrals. Saves us some time when we are ready to head out, but then we have to throw them some hay if they stay penned up too long. And hay has to be growed. You may have heard the truth, cowhands are allergic to farmin’.
Partway down Dead Horse there is a narrowing of the hills on each side called Badger Canyon for about a half mile which opens back out to the small Holding Canyon pasture which is a less narrow defile maybe a half mile square. It works great for holding the herd overnight.
The head of Badger Canyon is where the shootout had occurred, just where it narrows to about 50 foot wide. So when I get to the beginning of Badger, holy cow I start sweatin’. Lightning truly has been known the strike the same place twice.
My thighs grip tight to the saddle all on their own. Fortunately Spike is not a worrier. I consciously relax my muscles and say a short prayer to the animal spirits. “Easy buddy, take it easy.”
Nothing untoward occurs for the first 100 yards in.
“Things are lookin’ good, Spike.”
Okay, I admit it, Spike is calm. It’s me I’m trying to convince.
I about crap my pants when I hear a twig snap. Instantly my pistol is in my hand.
Wolf’s voice comes ‘halloin’ out of the brush.
I breathe again.
“Uh huh, figured you would be a shoot first, ask questions later type gal.”
“Son of a bitch, I just about was! If you hadn’t yelled when you did...”
“Paleface, if I’d been layin’ for ya you would have never heard the shot that killed you.”
“I was hoping that yesterday was just happenstance. It sure left me jumpy.”
“Lookin’ at the sign I’d say they got a regular deal comin’ up here. We’ll know more if we can track them past your cow tracks. You find your cow critters?”
“Naw, looks like just one cow and her little calf must have spooked. They are likely further down where Michael will pick them up. I ain’t cut no sign newer than yesterday.”
“Well cowgirl, you partner up with me, we can figure out if the outlaws are stealin’ things.”
“What have you got to do with it, Wolf?”
“I poke in to things.”
“Why poke in to things?”
“To satisfy my curiosity.  Once my curiosity is satisfied I am calm. When I am calm my thoughts are  pure.”
“Now that is definitely Injin talk.”
“Actually I think it has its origins with the other Injins, the India Indians. It is Zen.”
“Ah.
“You Injins got valuables?”
“Would that we did. Mm, maybe. Not business of white girl.”
“I’m the one they shot at, hurt my feelin’s and some body parts. I am actually part Kioway and Osage, not just white.”
“Hmm.” Wolf looks me up and down. “Tall, like Osage, but you not look Injin.”
That got my back up. “Oh yeah, what does a’ Injin look like? You racial profiling, Injin? Just ‘cause you are darker brown.”
“Haw, just pulling your leg. Haw haw. Glad to know you are of the chosen people. I am Comanche.”
“Does that make us ancestral enemies?”
“Many say Native American tribes all enemies. That not the mistake. Tribes not Native Americans. That the mistake,” says Wolf. “We came from Asia, got to Americas centuries ahead of Palefaces. The Comanche, we had our own Nation, Comancheria.
“Injin and Paleface came from same place before America time.
“But Injins better.
“So we are friends, all human people start in Africa, all same. We have our tribes, we have our friends, our families. No such tribe as Native Americans,” says Wolf.
“Hell, speakin’ of Natives, shouldn’t there be an original much worshiped bunch called Native Rockians? Who was on the first crew that terraformed the Rock, wouldn’t they be first, who the pioneers displaced? Yep. Native Rockians. Maybe the first pioneers killed them off.”
Wolf surprises me and says, “I never met any other than that one crazy Brit feller.”
“Crazy what feller?”
“You ain’t met His Lordship yet? You think Injin crazy...”
I interrupt, “I got no idea of Comanche ways, but yore’s do seem crazy. I guess whoever died and made you Chief taught you that you got the right to boss me around.”
“Sheeit, woman, you are some ballsy girl. I am Injin, and mighty proud of it. If you like I can teach you Injin ways, Woman Who Talks To Horses.”
“Say what now?” I’m ponderin’ on that statement. “Geez, Talks To Horses? Have you been shadowing me?”
“Yep. Heard a few speeches,” says Wolf. “It ain’t easy being red.”
“White mans’ stereotypes, Hollywood stories, have made us the Injins we are today, whether we like it or not.”
“Ain’t that the truth.”  Wolf puts heels to his horse. “Catch you later, Annie Talks To Horses.”
“Annie what?”
Wolf slows his horse and looks around. “Annie Talks To Horses, it is your Injin name.”
“How come I never heard it?”
“Lone Wolf has just named you after your habit of talking to your mount, it is good. And a rare privilege to make yore acquaintance.” Wolf doffs his hat with a nod then lopes his horse up the hill out of sight.
To his disappearing back I say, “Still a little on edge from being shot at yesterday. Thanks for asking.”
I look down at Spike’s ears. “Whose privilege? His? What the fuck? Annie Talks To Horses? Man has been follerin’ me for some while it seems. Shit, and close enough to hear me talking to you. Creepy, thinkin’ too much on that. Stalker or guardian angel? What’s yore impression, Spike?”
Maybe all this talking to horses is driving me to the loony bin. In my defense, horses like to be talked to. And then there’s dogs, who love a good song, especially if it’s about them. “Ain’t had a dog in a while actually,” I tell Spike. Who nods agreeably.
***
After my cowless go around, I must pass once again through Badger Canyon. Twice in one day is two times too many. All I can think about this time are the sheer canyon walls. They are easy 30 feet high on each side, makin’ the perfect sitiation for an ambush or dry gulchin’. I think about Lone’s Injin spirits and hope they will guide me through safely. My backside is swarmin’ with creepy crawlin’ nerves, but I keep my muscles relaxed so I don’t telegraph my unease to Spike.
Now, being as I have been out hereabouts for about a month and rode what seems like every inch of the country gatherin’ the Cattleman’s Association cattle, me and my mounts have learnt this ground fairly well. Hard to miss a foreign track with 25 of us scouting hill and dale, tracking them split hooved cow critters. Not one of the hands had reported seeing any strange activity. The cattle break plenty branches and, when they walk a trail, cover many a track. But a track atop the cow prints, we’d of noticed.
Maybe these shoot ‘em up fellas is new in the country or have just returned from a 30 day vacacion. In any case, riding back through that narrow defile makes my ass muscles clench up so tight onto the seat of my saddle that I couldn’t fart if I wanted to. Good thing I am aboard my best horse. Little red bay horse, Spike is, likes to crow hop of a chilly mornin’.
Even with my rifle slung across my lap, my trigger finger is itchy as hell. I feel like Spike is walking slow as molasses. Fortunately nothing goes amiss this trip. I start to believe I will live to sin another day. Buy me a ticket straight to hell.
After I get out in the open I slide my rifle back in the scabbard, give my arm a rest.
About an hour further on, I hear runnin’ horses.
Shit, hope they are friendly. Fortunately there is a big oak tree with some brush under it by the crick, so Spike and I head behind that. Maybe they’ll just saunter on by and not see us. I don’t want no more trouble. Feelin’ a bit coward like, in fact.
Spike and I go behind the massive tree trunk and set tight. I loosen up my sidearm in the holster, just in case. Hell, here comes a dude in a surrey. Nice team of matched Belgian draft horses providing the propulsion. I pull my longarm out of the scabbard again and flip the safety off, just in case.
“We’ll just set quietly here a spell. They’ll never hear us. Quiet now, Spike.”
Next I hear a big, “Halloo, the rider!”
So much for hiding.
He heads toward me where I appear to be loafin’ in the shade of the giant Mexican blue oak tree near a log corral. My quickly contrived story is that I am waiting for Michael to complete his circle. I am hoping he will have found the strays since I didn’t. Then we can work together to get them corralled and do any needed doctoring for shipment to their home ranch. Actually, it’s true. I am too nervous after the last few days to think anything up.
The surrey is a beauty, looks like a town rig all painted up with delicate stripes and swirls. It even has a pretty red fringe around the roof and curlicues on the wheels.
It pulls up beside me and I find the ‘dude’ to be a yahoo in fancy duds. I’m talkin’ suit, string tie, shiny boots, big ass white hat. This feller is way out of place out here in the bush. Gotta be a city slicker plumb lost. Oh crap, he has got a gun in his hand, too.
“Hold it right there, fella. We don’t need any itchy trigger fingers causing an accident,” I say.
“Whoa Nelly, relax that rifle,” says the stranger. “No need to get nervous. I am the good guys.”
“Says who?”
“I believe that would be me,” comes a voice from behind me.
Fuck a duck, I fell for the oldest trick in the book. “Okay, no need to shoot, I’ll set it down slowly.”
“I daresay, young lady, we have no desire to harm you, just holster that piece and we will call it good,” says the voice behind me.
I reset the safety and slide my rifle back in the scabbard. The feller behind me walks around into sight, his rifle lowered. The dude in the wagon holsters his revolver. And we all start breathing again. Who are these goofy fuckers? Damned dudes.
I sink the spurs but before Spike gets half a stride, the dude on the ground has caught my reins and pulled us up.
“Hold it there, young lady,” says the guy on the surrey. “We likely ain’t who you think we are, we come in peace. How about we all get down, meet and palaver.”
Ay yi yi, they got me.
We all step down, they doff their hats and holy guacamole, this one feller, as Michael would say, ‘Too die for!’ Tall, blonde and dead handsome, even has dimples. I like dimples. I wipe my chin to check for drool. Not too many about that are taller than me, but this fella measures up right nicely. And he don’t talk a bit like a dude despite the duds.
“Who are you?” I ask, still nervous.
The feller that snuck up on me bows and says, “Pardon, Miss, ladies first.”
“Hell, I’m Annie, picking up strays for the Cattleman’s Association hereabouts.”
The tall blonde says, “Pleasure, young lady. I am Spud Mullens and my friend here is Jake.”
“I say, please forgive my friend’s rough frontier manners. Allow me to introduce myself properly. Jake is my lead horse’s name, gesturing toward the near Belgian. I am Sir Jacob Bridbury, Duke of Barkingham, 88th Earl of Boyd, Heir to the Flemish fortune and Quimby Castle at Bridbury, first cousin to His Royal Majesty King Arthur II, Counsel to the Duke of Beltingham, Brother to the Pontiff of Laxham, Friend to the Court of Palanca, and descended from the Neanderthal. Ambassador to the planet Rock. No one else wanted to be. Your servant, Madam.”
That’s a mouthful. “Pleasure to meet ya,” I say.
“Enchanted. A beautiful woman, even one as manfully dressed as yourself, is always a pleasure to find in even these most primitive of circumstances. I say, you might want to stop by my castle and avail yourself of the bathing facilities.”
“Hell, Jakey, she don’t smell ripe to me,” counters the other fella.
“Certainly not, being of your species. Pardon, I meant to imply that you appear to have the forbearance of royalty and should be treated as such. The rude fashion of camping out that is oft practiced hereabouts is rough on the female persona even more so than on the male, delicate creatures that you are. My eternal apologies if I have offended.”
“Jakey, yore just diggin’ a deeper hole. My apologies, Ma’am. Sir Jacob, he ain’t from around here.”
“So I see. Yesterday there was some shootin’ in Badger Canyon over yonder, made me jumpy of strangers,” I say.
“Oh. We have arrived here via Badger slightly discombobulated ourselves,” says Sir Jacob.
“As Sir Jake is sayin’, we was out and about lookin’ over our country. Then about five minutes back we were mindin’ our own business. Heading through the canyon. When we find ourselves smack dab in the middle of a gun battle. Motherfuckers were blastin’ away at us. Fortunately, our team spooked and run us out of there right quick. We aim to be fucking well armed to the teeth next trip.”
“Quite. A rocket launcher will be perfect. A few grenades,” says Sir Jacob. “But I say, Spud, there is a lady present, best to mind your language.”
“No fucking problem,” I say to set them at ease lingo wise. “I was wishin’ I had brought a few of them motherfuckin’ grenades myself when I was pinned down the other day.”
They both smile and look relieved.
Spud is nice and tall, a man I can look up to, yeller blonde hair cascading over his forehead, great tan, startling blue eyes, broad shoulders, tight ass, dimples, shiny white teeth, the whole freaking package! Did I mention this already? Worth repeatin’.
“That was you?”
“Sorry, what?” I say, too busy gawkin’ at this Cowboy God to have heard a single word.
Spud says, “Do you know what the hell is goin’ on?”
I shake my head to get the cobwebs out. “Shoot, yea. I seemed to be right in the line of fire between two fractious factions yesterday. My horse ended up on top of me. Tall Injin fellow saved my ass.”
Who are these guys? Damn, they still are good lookin’. Add these two to Lone Wolf and Michael, maybe I just haven’t had any in way too long. They are all beautiful. And only Michael is off limits as far as I can see. I been tryin’ for years to get Michael to switch teams.
And failed.
“Wolf, yeah. He mentioned some excitement yesterday. He forgot to mention you were a girl.”
“A girl can be a cowhand.”
Spud looks at Sir Jacob. “She’s a mite touchy.”
“She ought not be, weren’t you the bloke who hired her?” asks Sir Jacob.
“Believe I was. I disremember hiring more than one girl. Bud said she was a top hand, but this one seems a mite simple in the head. Must be two of ‘em.
“I say we get rid of this girl. I know a place just up the trail, lots of bears. We got too many strangers in the area already.”
“We are not getting rid of the young lady.”
“Why not? She’s dimwitted. Plus how do we know we can trust her?” Spud winks.
“No matter, I like her,” says Sir Jacob, “and she is pleasing to the eye.”
“Hey! I’m right here, listening.”
“See? Not dim, knows we are speaking of her. I say we let her in on it,” says Sir Jacob.
“Disregarding all that, I was thinking lightning might strike twice. Is this all a coincidence or did we each get bushwhacked by the same fellers on two different days?” I say.
“It seems that some kinda war has placed itself right in the middle of our cattle range,” says Spud.
I look at the fancy Brit. “Are you sure he ain’t the dim one?”
Sir Jacob smiles and pokes Spud in the side. “See? Excellent judge of character.”
“Yea, it was Wolf that saved me. He said they were shootin’ at each other, not me. So, you acquainted with Wolf?”
“Hell yeah, Wolf and I are brothers,” says Spud. “Guess we all better get together with Wolf and have a powwow. I’ll send out a smoke signal tonight.
“If he saved your bacon, you must be okay. He don’t generally go out of his way with strangers, even pretty ones. Plus you work for the Association. We would have met on the roundup, but I was off on business. I own the Par Excellence Bar None.”
“Oh, that Mullens.” I had heard he was a hardass motherfucker. Seems to be true. Bit of a shit, too, I’d say. No one mentioned he was a stud, a broad shouldered fine ass motherfucker. If I tape his smart mouth shut, ooh doggies. I’ll need to get hands on.
“I say, Wolf is as tough a gentleman as it has been my pleasure to encounter on this primitive rock,” declares Jacob, a fancy lookin’ sucker. He seems out of place in this world. Talks like a high tone English Lord. Oh, yeah, he said he was...Sir something or other...sheesh.
“You sticking around for a while?” asks Spud.
“My feelings are sure hurt over the whole shootout deal. Reckon I have a duty to the Cattleman’s Association too, seeing as how I am working this country for them. Outlaws ain’t likely to care about the rights of cattlemen or their cows. Can’t afford to lose no cows to flying lead.” Plus I got nowhere else to go, long story.
“And they don’t seem to care who is in their line of fire. Wolf has been out studying their tracks and such today. I’ll get him out here mañany and we will rendezvous,” intones Spud.
“My camp is just up the side draw here if you want to meet up there. Take a left by that big cottonwood. Lone Wolf knows where it’s at. Let me know if you need help, my partner and I will be around a few more days.”
“Yore partner good lookin’?” asks Spud.
I say, “Oh hell yeah!”


8  Powwow


The next day I meet up with Lone Wolf, Spud and Sir Jacob out at the trail crossing for a quick confab. Lone has little to report, having seen only enough to give him a few theories.
“My partner will be here in five,” I say.
“Good lookin’, you say?” asks Spud.
“Yep, extremely.”
Wolf covers his grinning mouth, gets control of his features, then adds, “Yeah, Wolf meet Annie’s partner, very beautiful. Just yore type.”
Oh crap, I think, another guy too good lookin’ to be straight? Arghhh. Just my luck.
Michael appears around the bend, in his full flamboyant voice. Waving a loose wristed hand in the air, he says, “Oh, Annie, introduce me. I hear you’ve found a whole herd of fabulous studs!”
“Yes siree, and Spud the Stud here has been super excited to meet yore fine fairy ass,” I say.
We all look at the extremely red faced Spud, who is waving a hand in front of his face. “No, um, no. There has been a misunderstanding here.” Then he glances around at us, laughing our asses off. Cowboy humor, keeps us going.
Michael extends a suddenly macho hand. He is a bit red too. “My apologies for my evil partner, it seems she has bamboozled us both. No harm meant, except to our fragile egos.”
He turns to me and says, “Annie, I will have you over my knee if this behavior continues,” which gets us all about rolling out of our saddles with glee again.
We decide to split up and track the suckers in and out, see if we can figure out what is so valuable as to be worth the shootin’ of innocent passersby. We all agree that there is more here than meets the naked eye.
I put in a long day with not much results: hoofed or booted, other than giving my overworked cowpony another big workout. Fortunately, he is way tougher than I will ever be. Spike sure appreciates his hay and oats come nightfall.
The following morning Michael and I are snug in our separate soogans when I roll over and open my eyes. Sure enough that wily Injin has crept into our camp again, stirred up the coals and made us a pot of coffee. Pure evil, the man is. 
So much for my Injin blood. I apparently have inherited no Injin skills. Sleepin’ with one eye open is not in my DNA. Once again Lone could have killed us both in our sleep had he been so inclined.
“Shit Lone, damn good thing I didn’t start up and shoot you before I got the sleep out of my eyes.”
“You white folks never hear Injin, I make plenty noise this mornin’. Got Injin juju on my side.
“Roll out and grab a cup. Sir Jacob has broke a rule and invited you to his teepee. He never invites strangers in. I believe he has fallen for your feminine wiles.”
“If he is susceptible to feminine wiles, wait ‘til he spends some time with Michael. He can out feminine me with one hand tied behind his back.”
“Not sure Sir Jacob will appreciate the irony there, really not sure,” says Wolf.
“I just met that guy the other day and a minute or two of observation showed me that he’s a different one, as dandified as I ever saw.”
“Sir Jacob has a past that none of us have found out much about. He is surely a believer in the end of the worlds being soon. He is well prepared, which has more than once worked out well for Spud and all us Injins he has befriended.”
“You have people hereabouts, Lone?”
“Not legal for Injins to be out here. We are good reservation livers. Smart Injin stay on res.
“It is well known to me, when things go wrong, White Eyes blame the Injins. History repeat itself all over again.”
After we coffee down and saddle up, Lone Wolf leads us up a well forested draw and into just about another world.
We head up a pretty steep stream for an hour and into a maze of huge granite boulders. After some serious winding about we come to a dead end, or so it seems. We are at the end of a box canyon with cliffs all around, including dead ahead.
Lone leads us into a just about impenetrable clump of Arizona cypress. Stuck just behind one of the mass of huge rocks there appears the mouth of a cave. It is hidden very well by brush and trees. I doubt even seasoned brush jumpers like us would ever come upon it by our lonesomes.
We dismount and lead our horses into the cave. Just as the light just about peters out to nothing, Lone stops at a ledge where there are carbide lamps and matches. He lights up one for each of us. Further inside there is a large room set up as a stable, hay and all. There we unsaddle and put our steeds in a small pen with a shock of hay each. There is water coming into the troughs from somewhere and some natural light filtering in through a crack in the roof.
Horses cared for, we walk on into the tunnel. It is a short hike, maybe 30 yards to a door. Lone invokes the Injin gods in some way and the door opens for us.
Inside the door it is nothing short of amazing.
First there is the tunnel, looks like an old mine. I can see veins of some type of metallic ore glittering in the walls and even places where miners have driven in and high graded the ore.
“Gold?” I ask Lone.
“White man steal Injin gold.”
“How’d they pull that off, you Injins bein’ so watchful and stealthy and know it all?”
“White Eyes sneak in and mine from before we conquer these parts. Injin move into this area not long time past, our birthright, everything. Now we more watchful, less firewater.”
“Mm.”
We head on down the tunnel passing cross drifts, making a few turns here and there, kinda confabulatin’ in fact. If we lose Lone and run out of fuel in the lanterns, it could get nasty trying to find the way out. If only we had brought bread crumbs. Hell, we could have crumbled it ourselves if we carried a loaf of bread in our emergency kit. But whoever thinks to?
Eventually we arrive at another heavy wood door with wrought iron hinges and hasp. Lone Wolf knocks some kind of fancy secret knock and we wait.


9  Jake’s Joint


In a bit the door opens and we enter. Sir Jacob is there in a fine and fancy suit. He has it all, frilly shirt, vest, suit coat, pants, jacket, shiny boots too. I am sure if I was high toned I would find him quite dashing. On second thought, I do.
Sir Jacob speaks up, “One must remember, Mr. Wolf, that the knock pattern changes on a biweekly basis. You seem to always be a fortnight behind the times.”
“So you’ll know it’s me, English White Eyes.”
“Ah, clever.”
Sir Jacob then turns to me and says, “Excuse my manners Miss Annie, welcome, come, join us. Would tea be acceptable? No doubt we have a crumpet to accompany and perhaps a small tankard of home brew for the primitives? Or perhaps an early vintage of my vino? I have stemware. I say, I feel that you, madam, are cut of a finer cloth than the savage Wolf and oddly named Spud.”
“You’ll have to forgive Sir Jake, he gets a bit nervous in the presence of comely young ladies,” says Spud.
“In fact, none of us see comely young ladies often enough,” says Sir Jacob.
“By early vintage he means a decade or so before last. This place ain’t been around too very long, but his brew is tasty,” says Spud. “Come on in, pilgrims. Welcome to Sir Jacob’s humble abode.”
“Hello. Sir Jacob, you remember my partner, Michael Santa Cruz.”
“Ah, we were not formally introduced at the time due to the merriment. Spud is still reeling, I believe,” says Sir Jacob clasping his hand. “Sir Jacob Bridbury, Duke of Barkingham, Earl of Boyd, Heir to the Flemish fortune and to Quimby Castle at Bridbury, first cousin to His Royal Majesty King Arthur II, Counsel to the Duke of Beltingham, Brother to the Pontiff of Laxham, Friend to the Court of Palanca, and descended from the Neanderthal. Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to The Planet Rock. No one else wanted to be, you see. At your service, kind sir.”
“Pleasure is all mine, Sir Jacob,” says Michael.
“You are working on the cattle roundup also?”
“Yep, I’m an old gay cowhand from somewhere a few planets away from the Rio Grande.”
“Come on in, we shall exchange lies over a glass of homemade wine. I in fact have a few vintage bottles brought from an earlier life on another world.”
“Homemade wine? Who would have thought civilization would have penetrated way out here into the Cosmos campo,” says Michael.
We all head out of the entryway and into a huge area with walls hung with racks of every weapon I ever heard of and many more. The décor is most certainly scholarly survivalist. Cowhide furniture, obviously hand crafted. What a palace. And back against the far wall, I walk closer, and holy shit!
 It is a cabinet of old books. Actual books! Holy guacamole. Bunches of ‘em. Shelves of books. Wow, I rush over and just gawk at ‘em. Scared to touch. Damn.
“The ‘Peace Room’, dedicated to the signatories of the Rock Declaration of Independence,” Sir Jacob announces as we walk through.
“The secret Declaration of Independence, mind you. If the Centrists knew of it they’d blow us right out of the Cosmos.”
Sir Jacob continues, “The ‘Moonshine Room’,” as we walk in, gawking.
Sir Jacob takes us over to a rack of wine barrels and threading a clear hose in through a bunghole, siphons out glasses of wine all around.
Sir Jacob raises his glass and says, “Here’s to us, the men who are doing what is legislated as wrong in order to accomplish what we believe is right. Revolutionaries.”
We raise our glasses and partake, mumbling in agreement.
“Now to business,” interjects Spud.
“Allow me, Miss Talks To Horses and Mr. Santa Cruz, to offer the convenience of my baths should you care to wash off the trail dust. We can start our business without you,”  says Sir Jacob.
“Oh yes, that would be fabulous,” says Michael.
“I see my new Injin name has already been popularized by, as you call him, Mr. Wolf,” I say.
“We have all heard you talking to said beasts, hard for you to deny.”
“Proud of it, actually. I like to brag that I ride some of the best behaved horses in the country. They appreciate the consideration of a pleasant word or two.”
“Best horses?” says Spud. “Naw, you ain’t seen mine.”
“Injin horse more better than both. Injin make good horse medicine,” Wolf interjects.
We adjourn to the baths. Sir Jacob has more than one! And luxurious, Michael and I wash and swim our cares away in true Roman fashion. On our return to the very warlike Peace Room, we find everyone standing around a table.
“You are in the fray now, Annie. We have continued the equine discussion and it seems each of us owns the perfect steeds,” says Sir Jacob. “Now to work. Come join us at the big table. We can lay out a map and share intelligence.”
We all head in and settle ourselves around a huge slab of Douglas fir. A table fit for a king.
I, of course, speak up. “This place is truly amazing, an underground castle. Soaking in the bath, I felt like royalty.”
Sir Jacob smiles and Spud laughs out loud.
“Along with being His Lordship, Sir Jacob claims descendance from some god awful King or other. Don’t egg him on.”
“His majesty, the King of Andorra, a few and more generations back. I am Basque by way of England, a descendant of shepherds,” says Sir Jacob. “My formal introduction is already lengthy enough without adding the dear Basquos.”
“Your Highness,” I say as I mock a bow and scrape.
“Har har,” says Spud. Kind of a jackass, this guy.
Sir Jacob says, “Don’t mind Spud. A mere commoner, he understands not the privilege and superior intellect of the Royals.”
“Sheeeit. Wanna have a brain pissin’ contest?” says Spud.
“Seriously, Spud, Jake, we got interlopers to get shed of, quit screwin’ around,” says Wolf.
“Now,” says Sir Jacob, “for a report from our faithful Injin companion.”
Lone Wolf tries unsuccessfully not to grin. “I rode the north section following their tracks, then backtracked them the other way. I suppose they come in from MadDog. There seem to just be the three of them headed back toward town. Then coming back this way, it is harder to tell. It seems that when they ran into Annie here, they got spooked and never made it to wherever they were planning on going. In other words, I got nothing but guesses.”
“I don’t know about them being spooked by me, but I was sure spooked by them.”
“You killed or grievously wounded the one, from what Wolf tells me.”
“Didn’t find anything on the trail but off the trail I found blood at last light, too dark to track it,” says Wolf.
“What did you and Michael find?” Sir Jacob asks.
“Whole lot of nothing. Maybe it was their first day in the country. We need to lay up and watch them,” I report.
“We-ell.” Michael flips his wrist. “If we can locate their camp, maybe I should go undercover.”
“What makes you think they want a flaming queen in their camp?” I ask.
“You forget I am a classically trained actor. And, in fact, any gay learns in his short pants to play straight if needed. I have fabulous gaydar, not a problem.”
“A vote?” asks Sir Jacob.
“Maybe shape changer have good idea. I find outlaw camp tonight, Injin smell smoke, find fire. Little Mike go in for kill.”
“No kill, just info, we don’t know who or what yet. Let’s not jump the figurative gun, troops,” says Spud, taking the reins. “With a small dedicated group there is nearly nothing that cannot be accomplished. We will reconvene as needed.”
“We can only accomplish if we keep our scalps.”
I am still in awe of Sir Jacob’s lair.
“This is amazing, all these black as night tunnels, but in the living area sky lights, windows, courtyard gardens, wow!”
Spud tells us, “Sir Jacob has him an actual fortress with firewalls, battlements, armaments, and no arraignments.”
“Why no arraignments?”
“That falls under my ‘hit the bastards in the head with a shovel, then bury ‘em with a backhoe’ policy. No need for lawyers,” says Sir Jacob.
“Aha.”
It turns out, that however the wilderness rules were written, Sir Jacob does have a backhoe hidden in his underground fortress. Although it was said jocularly, I wonder if he really has used the backhoe to bury dead bodies. Why the hell not? Less shoveling for us peons. He takes us down another tunnel and shows it off to us before we take our leave.
Michael and I saddle back up and head for camp.
“That was some castle, enjoyed the hell out of that huge rock bath.” Plenty of room for me and a good lookin’ cowboy, I wish. “Company not too shabby either,” I say.
“That Sir Jacob, though. He’s a mite quirky,” observes Michael.
“Please, that charming bastard’s looking at quirky in the rearview mirror. Sorta intriguing, actually. He gay or straight, Mr. Gaydar?”
“Yep.”
“Keeping yore own counsel?”
“Yep.”
“Mm,” I nod.


10  Mystory not History


Couple and some centuries have passed since the heyday of the Cowboys and Injins and we have a ton of information about those ancient times in the Hollywood stories that have been passed down around the campfire for generations.
We actually live in a much more primitive world in many ways. Of course we are at the same time and very ironically much more advanced. Certainly in the Center Worlds, at the core of modern civilization the advances are astonishing. But here, on our new little Rock home on the edge of the Cosmos, life is in some ways much closer to the 1880s.
Everywhere in the Cosmos man seems to still be man. Loving, hateful, spiteful, belligerent, jealous, envious, greedy, murderous, you name it. Though we like to believe we have risen above our primitive ancestors, we have but to retell an Old John Wayne western story to see that times were the best and the simplest then. These old stories represent the best in men, which those dreamers among us hope to recapture.
Reality, however, is a cruel mistress and these new hot dogging interlopers are a deadly reminder. The plot we uncover. It’s a long story.
Can we ever revive the high standards of the olden days? After all, we are all but students of The Duke.
They’s a lot said about what happened betwixt the Hollywood years and now. It’s called the Troubles. One of the things that happened is the schools.
Now the Center has their own story ‘bout what happened, we got ours. All I got to say about their ‘official story” is that half of writing history is all about hiding the truth.
This is the story I got figured out. It’s the truth as I see it.
First there was petroglyphs, symbols carved in rock. Then they had hieroglyphs, fancier symbols writ on papyrus. Then several someones came up with alphabets. Next they got everyone in schools and taught ‘em readin’ and writin’. Then they had printing and made books. People wrote in a hurry, ran the letters together into a stream called cursive. Then electronics come along and they all started typing. They used to say that the age of electronics was the information age. In point of fact, I’ve heard it said that without careful personal censorship it could be the drowning in information age.
So to cut down on all the info cluttering the kids’ minds and save teaching time the schools decided no need for cursive, it’s antiquated and typing is faster. Then as everyone got a laptop or tablet, the schools said no one needs to write anymore. Pencil and paper is old school.
What happened next of all, as far as has been passed down, was they quit teaching writing at all! Everyone typed into electronic devices: phones, pads, palms. Folks started listening to books rather than reading them.
That seemed all fine and dandy until a few generations passed and somebodies, a government or three, no doubt, got in an argument and set off the first big bang of the Troubles. An EMP it was and...
Shazam, no more electronic devices. That EMP left ‘em, for all intents, unplugged.
Oh and, oops, suddenly we didn’t know how to write anymore, much less read. Hell, we had never used a pencil. The few Neanderthal ancients that remembered how to write, not many could read it. Hand written letters are not as exactly each the identical same and so way harder to read for folks used to keyboard script. During the poor hardscrabble post war existence, no time to study up on it either. Hell of a deal.
Took us a mighty long time to come back from that. Still a passel of illiterates out there.
So once again, Civilization: Good, bad or just plain stupid?


11  Wilderness


It’s creepifyin’ that old Earth got used up. How did they do it?
Scary to even ponder on too hard, ‘specially if, like they claim, history repeats itself. Which it seems to be doin’ right here in front of our eyes on the Rock. The Rock being one of the more primitive paradises left fer cowhands to inhabit that Michael and I have found.
The Centrists started as a merger of the Demoplicans and Replutocrats in retaliation to the upsurge of the Libertarian Party, whose growth in strength and reputation made it obvious that the original two parties needed to combine or they would indeed be conquered. The Libertarian menace was the common enemy that forced them to join forces or drown. Their merger into the Centrist party was an obvious choice, as their fight over the middle of the road needed to gain a majority of the vote was causing them to be indistinguishable, even to the least educated of the unwashed masses. The long and bloody war that ensued pushed the individualistic Libertarian rebels to the outer planets on the edges of space.
After the Troubles, a lot of these outer planets was declared as wilderness areas. No motorized vehicles allowed. Not sure why, for tourists to come ogle us? T’were true on some of them holiday planets.
It was also figured to be a sure fire way to recover from the ravages of the cities. Now that the cities were all gone, blown to smithereens in the Troubles, the plants and lesser animals would take back their land. And humans had, we hoped, learned a lesson. Too many of any animal, even humans, in too close of quarters, not a smart idea. Killed the Earth.
‘Course then livin’ primitive, no runnin’ water, no electric, people found out just how much harder life without machines is. So they started tinkerin’, inventin’ and makin’. Pretty soon, if we ain’t careful, they change it so only some of the planet is wilderness, then the good landing and harbor areas get developed and then development slowly but surely moves inland. Happening on a lot of planets.
Anyone having taken the wrong side in the Troubles, like the sparse populations of the outer worlds, are still dirt poor, even illiterate and living in towns that are considered little more than ghettos by the Centrists. This works to the Centrists advantage to keep them tame and to get them trained to be good little workers. Folks are rewarded for living in the city and attending the schools, churches and workin’ at full time careers that keep the Centrist government runnin’ and in power.
The farmers and ranchers are a more idealistic and individualistic lot. Especially now that the tough times have lessened as the farms and ranches get established, the pioneers have more time to think about they and their children’s futures. And they have rediscovered the joy of the decidedly unvegger beef barbeque.
Traders have started showing up in ships hawkin’ cheap technologies and folks have started trading their goods.
Every planet does it different, but we’re sure ‘nough crawling, tooth and claw, our way up Nob Hill.
Just sayin’.
‘Course from a cowhands point of view, being a lover of grass and trees and all sich, I gotta say it worked out well. Here at the outer edge (if not off the edge) of the Cosmos, we ain’t got too much civilization, so we live quiet and free. Not bothered by anyone, no one loves us and no one cares. No complaints here. Until now. 
Who the heck keeps shootin’ at me? Cuttin’ into my quiet times.




12  Look Out


Bright and early next morning we head back out to look at the blood sign. We don’t have any other leads. We need another sighting, or at least some fresh tracks, to give us something actual to investigate. The hombres Lone Wolf had spotted previously vanished by the time he had worked his way around to their positions.
As we ride back out toward the scene of the ambush he explains.
“Looking at how they were set up and which way they was aiming, they were either laying in a crossfire to get whoever came up the canyon or they were in a gun fight with each other when Annie and I showed up. They either thought they killed us and left, or else us runnin’ into their firing lines fightin’ and shootin’ spooked the hell out of them.”
“Too many choices, gotta narrow ‘er down.”
“Skullduggery? Alien abduction?”
Wolf and I look over quizzically.  
“Farfetched, I know, but it too had to be mentioned,” says Michael.
“In any case they seem to have appeared out of nowhere. Can’t find sign in all that rocky ground,” says Wolf.
Hence Michael and I go on about our back riding business, keeping an eye out for anything suspicious or any shooting, while Wolf plies his trade.
Sure enough, after a day of roaming the country to the west, we have found 10 head between us and are headed back into the canyon, when one dry cow takes it into her head to go into the, of course, thickest brush around, just under the rim rock. I spur Spike in to head her off, but end up follerin’ her on into the thicket where holy moly, I strike proverbial gold. Or not.
A dead body ain’t exactly gold, but it did appear to maybe be a clue.
Michael swings down for a better look and says, “Ugh, this fella is completely corpsified.”
“You can be incompletely corpsified?”
Michael strikes a pose. “Oh, sweetie, if you saw a few of those old queens hanging on by the fingernails to their long lost youth? Still alive but definitely corpsified.”
That gets us to laughing. Helps overcome the pukifyin’ smell, but not much. Not a pretty sight for the eyeballs either.
“Maybe that Injin you are so sweet on can spot something we missed; he knows the territory pretty well.”
“Sweet? Me?”
“Not sweet, sweet on, sweetie.”
We look around the area, trying not to disturb things too much.
“Yo, Michael, can you head them cows on down toward the corral then come back up and help me investigate this bloated up feller?”
“Gladly,” he says, holding his nose theatrically. “Be back shortly.”
And off he goes.
Now this here feller is purely shot through the head. Not too pretty. And there is a track or two about, like as if the killer had come over to be sure the job was done. I mean if his buddies had come to check on him, wouldn’t they of buried the poor soul?
Weren’t much of a face left to identificate. I did find a few shell casings from his rifle, showing he had been in the fight. Not just shot without notice like I almost was.
Lone shows up about then.
“Hey girl, what you messin’ with now?”
“Hey, Lone Wolf, meet my friend, Headless.”
“Life has been extinguished. Spirit still burns,” explains Wolf. “It will find a new vessel and alight.”
“You say so.”
“Michael sent me up,” Wolf says. “I told him to head on down to camp when he was done beddin’ them cattle down. I can help you out.”
“Good to know that my crew follers your orders.”
“Seemed logical.”
“It was, I was just pullin’ yore leg. Maybe Michael will scare up dinner for us.
“You know this guy?” I ask.
“Hard to say, I don’t believe his head always looked that way. You find any eyeballs so we can get the color?” asks Wolf.
“Why do I need to sort through the goo? May not be an eyeball intact. His hair looks to be brown or blonde maybe?” I find a stick and troll through the remains until I find a blue eyeball. Smell is worse than the gore. Amazingly, I don’t puke when I find it.
“Blue and dishwater blonde is my call.”
“Sure. Hey girl, lay down next to him so we can see how tall he is. Add eight inches for the head. Here, let’s straighten him out.”
“Isn’t there an easier way?”
“Sure, pull out yore pocket tape measure.”
“Yeesh.” I look down, trying not to get in the massive pool of brain and blood splatter. “Are you doing this just to creep me out?”
“Just checkin’ yer fitness for tough work.” Wolf grins.
I grab his cowboy booted feet and Lone his shoulders, there being not enough head intact to get a good hold on. “So is he before going stiff or after?”
“Rigor has come and gone. I’m thinkin’ he was shot by that bullet that about took yore ear off the other day. I just didn’t see him ‘cause I was lookin’ at you and Bogey.”
“Maybe I was just caught in a crossfire with no ill will for me. I was a blazin’ along at that point of the battle. Then when you joined in, we likely raised their enmity. Not that my wingin’ that one feller didn’t help.”
I lay down next to the corpse, trying to avoid the blood and brains. Get my shoulders lined up with Headless’s so Lone can judge his height. Nasty work, but I got cojones or at least I don’t want Wolf to know I don’t.
“Little feller, 5’ 8” I’d say. Good six inches shorter’n you, Stretch.”
Yuck, I jump up, feelin’ a mite green. “That’s how you tell the bad guys, short.”
“Guys too short for yore attention are still folks. Don’t mean they are bad. Just ‘cause they got short changed in the height department,” says Wolf.
“Don’t make ‘em good, either. But you are right, he could be with the good guys. Can’t say ‘til we know more.”
“So 5’8”, blondish hair, blue eyes, regular clothes. Well, blue work shirt with snaps, blue jeans, boots.”
“What the heck did they shoot him with to blow his head up like that? Were they real close and used a shotgun?” I ask.
“Good question, let’s scout the holes where the others were laying up.”
Off to the north, on down the trail a ways, is the spot where the second guy had been spotted by Lone. We look her over and see that this feller had shot .45-70, and from the lay of the ejected shells had been aiming across the trail to where the last two were laid up in wait. Then we cross the draw and check the two south sites. The westerly one has a similar look. The third shooter had used a .45 Colt, likely a lever action from the drop pattern of the ejected brass casings. We go on to number four. He was at the east end, the end I had come in from, and he had a bipod mounted .50 cal.
“That just might blow your head clean off with the right load.”
“Like an old Buffalo gun, eh?”
“Yep, mighty straight shootin’ and kicks like a mule. Mayhaps he had some kind of explosive bullet in front of a shitload of powder. So when you come through the draw, this .50 caliber feller shot at Headless, you ran into the path and heard the bullet whistle by your ear, then it headed on through the air to turn the other guy into Mr. Headless. It were about 250 yards all told. Mighty powerful.”
“So what do we know that we didn’t before?” asks Wolf.
“They was four, no five, of them. There’s the one I shot off yore back.
“.50 Cal either had amazing reflexes, aimed at you and got his buddy by accident because Bogey was one jump ahead of the bullet, or he was shooting at his enemy, future Headless, and you ran through the bullet’s path.”
“So, back to square one.” I shrug.
“We do know their boot sole patterns now and we know they was five to start with. We know the calibers of their guns, but we don’t know if they beamed right in outa outer space or where they come from,” says Wolf.
“Was they afoot or ahorseback? Mighty long walk from anyplace out here to nowhere.”
“Ha-ha, ‘Nowhere’ is the name of Sir Jacob’s place. How did you know that?”
“Never did, just feeling pretty far out here for so many people to be about.”
“Full name is the ‘Arse End of Nowhere Ranch’. Spud and Sir Jacob are maybe partners in it. Not sure. They do get thick as thieves.”
“What about you, Lone? You seem to be in it, too.”
“Hell, I’m just a dumb Injin. Got horses, not cows.”
“How you make a living at that?”
“Raise damn good horses and I am the Guardian of the Spirit Cave.”
“What is that?’
“My tribe has an ancient Spirit Cave, plenty big medicine. I protect it.”
“What is inside?”
“Only the Spirit Elders know of these things. The cave is sacred to my people. The Elders come soon for Spirit Cave Ceremonies. Big doin’s for the People. Make our year shine.”
“Ah.”
We ride over to the aptly named ‘Nowhere’ to exchange intelligence with Spud and Sir Jacob, if you can call it that. Intelligence, I mean. We had damn little info from our snooping other than Headless, of course, the anonymous corpse.
He was something tangible and also stinking to high heaven. So we left him in place. He hadn’t been found by the coyotes yet, but it wouldn’t be long before their patrols sniffed (ugh!) him out. Coy dogs love the stinky stuff.
We impart our new finds to the boys.
Sir Jacob’s reaction is quick. “I shall harness the team. We will take the Periwinkle to transport the corpse. Will it be possible to get close enough with it to load the body?”
“Periwinkle?” I ask.
“Jakey’s spring wagon with mobile lab aboard,” offers Spud, the only one who seems to call the Sir ‘Jakey.’
“I think you can get in there with the wagon. Headless corpses weigh less not having the head, you know.” I think I’m educatin’ somebody, hah.
“So you can tote him a bit if you don’t mind the mess. I don’t think you’ll need a pack horse to get him out. Hope yore team is broke to stinky man corpses, though,” I say.
“Could be a rodeo. Maybe I otter go along to take a pitchur of that,” says Spud.
“Yeah and you can lug the body, being a big strong feller, Mister Photo Op,” I interject.
“Seems to me you are the big muscular girl type, maybe you should go tote him.”
“Hell, yeah, that I will, Mr. Puny,” I say.
Spud was 6’4” if he was a’ inch and did I mention his muscles yet? Tight, lovely muscles. Enough to drive this girl mad with desire. I was feeling mighty loverly over this big hunk, but I would be clever and not let on. Besides, he was kind of a’ asshole. Providential, seein’ as he was from the ‘Arse End of Nowhere Ranch.’ 
“But just in case I need a weakling to take the foot end, maybe you better tag along,” I add.
Sir Jacob says, “I can surely be of assistance.”
“You are the driver, likely need you to hold the horses when they get the smell of all that blood. We need to both go, mayhaps we will find a clue.”
“Yeah, all three of your heads together might make half a’ Injin brain,” says Wolf.
“Mayhaps, indeed. Thanks for the compliment, red man.”
So we harness up and all set off to investergate or interpolate or whatever it was we are supposed to do. Mainly I want to get shed of the whole deal. Except maybe I need to get to know Lone, Spud and Sir Jacob a bit better. Not often a girl runs into two hot hunks and a Lord, especially not out at the ass end of nowhere with not hardly a soul about. Like I said, the finest kind of country. I got ‘em all to my loverly little ol’ self.
From Sir Jacob’s lair we head out with his Periwinkle, which has an amazing mobile laboratory in the bed.
Spud tells me, “Sir Jacob is best known for his gun collection, but he also has mad scientific skills. He is interested in ‘most ever’thing.”
Lone, riding Scout alongside Spike and I, explains, “Finding and autopsying dead animals is just another of his many unique hobbies.”
“The headless corpse is an opportunity for myself to move my animal autopsy skills on into the study of the human species. Study, examine, double check, research, measure twice, and cut once,” says Sir Jacob.
Everyone has a good laugh when Wolf tells them how he got me to lie down by the corpse for measurement. Spud trots up and reaches in Lone’s saddle bags, draws out a cloth tape measure. “He always carries one to collect measurements for things too big to drag back for Sir Jacob to examine.”
Lone says, “You had to be there to really appreciate it. She laid right down like a trooper.”
“Didn’t want to spoil his wild Injin image with a tape measure,” Spud says.
“Glad I could brighten up yore mornin’, fellas.”


13  Exsanguination


As we pull into the dell where Headless’ spirit is asleepin’ a rider comes shooting out of the trees, jumps on his ground tied horse and hightails it down the road. It’s deja vu all over again.
Lone Wolf makes chase.
As Wolf closes in he hops onto the horse’s rump, landing close behind the rider. The two struggle while the horse, after a short shy to the opposite side of Lone’s leap, gallops on. The rider pulls out a knife while the horse is racing flat out across the valley dodging brush and trees. Wolf and the rider struggle mightily. The knife flashes around catching the sun when suddenly Wolf topples off.
The rider struggles to regain his balance and he and his horse shoot on out of sight.
“Wolf!” Spud gets there first.
Wolf is layin’ out. Spud leans over him.
I pull up and can see the blood before I hit the ground. “Wolf!”
“He okay?” I ask Spud
“Good gods,” says Sir Jacob, last to arrive, driving the team.
We all lean over and look. “He ain’t moved, knocked out, I think. Lot of blood, but not much damage I can see, just nicked a big vessel. Long slice here in his side, but not too much more than skin deep. Here Jakey, yore the Doc,” says Spud. He moves over as Sir Jacob walks up.
I saunter over and grab the team, who have started to dance a bit.
“Likely smelled the blood,” says Spud.
“Yep.”
“Bring my kit, Spud. We shall take advantage and stitch while he’s unconscious. Hopefully it won’t be long.”
Spud delivers the medical bag, then returns to hand me the carriage weight. “Brakes are set.”
“We’ll need some of that anesthetic firstly, Spud,” says Sir Jacob.
“He’s already asleep.”
“For the surgeon,” says Sir Jacob as he raises the bottle. “Steady hands, better job.” And passes it around.
I hold Wolf’s head in my lap and Spud assists Sir Jacob as he stitches Wolf’s side.
Damned if he doesn’t finish his whip stitch and knot it just as Wolf starts to moan.
“Holy shit, I hit that ground wrong. Damn,” swears Wolf.
“S’possed to tuck and roll, buddy.” Spud looks relieved. “Glad yore still with us, pard.”
“Here, we saved some medicine for you, my fine redskin friend.” Sir Jacob passes him the bottle.
After a break, Wolf rises and whistles. Scout trots up.
“You are welcome to ride in the wagon, Wolf,” says Sir Jacob.
“Injin have horse. More comfy,” says Wolf. “Right, Talks To Horses?”
“Yep.”
“Man this sucker stinks!” says Spud. “The tree cover must have hid him from the vultures.”
We hop out of the wagon and get to work.
After a close look, Sir Jacob declares, “Exsanguination.” 
“Having most of his head shot off might have had some to do with it,” says Spud.
After a thorough on sight examination, Sir Jacob uses a shovel to lift the remains of the head into a burlap sack. We lay the headless corpse out on a canvas tarp and wrap him for transport. Gloves on, Spud and I heft him over and hoist him aboard. Wolf has gone out on a circuit lookin’ for the runner and any other clues.
I am true to my word and take the head end. Even though it is about 20 yards to the wagon, Spud never breaks a sweat. He sure looks handsome, all bare chested in the heat. Who hoo! Muscle man.
“Hey, Spud, them feet ain’t too heavy for ya are they? I can take the whole corpse if you like.”
“Women!”
“Here now, I have busted bigger bulls than this fer fun of a Sunday.”
“Okay, so yore not the average girl, but you are still a girl, puny compared to a real man.”
“Remind me to challenge you to a riding and shootin’ contest next chance we get. I will kick your ass.”
Sir Jacob is amused. “Bloody hell, you two sound quite silly fighting over naught. We are quite aware of what you are actually about.”
Danged if Spud doesn’t turn beet red. Hm. ‘Course, I never did. Okay, that might be a lie.
Wolf rides up as we are about to head out and hands something to Sir Jacob. “A bullet for yore collection,” he says.
“Ah.” Sir Jacob examines it with a glass, then measures with calipers. “.50 caliber.”
“Buffaler gun,” says Spud.
We mount up and haul Headless off for an autopsy and likely an improper burial.



14  Eureka!


We hadn’t found much new other than the bullet when we picked up Headless’ corpse. That slick rock still had us stymied. So the next day Wolf and I each take one side of the rim rock above the canyon to see what we can find. Spud goes down the bottom again, working on foot and slow, so as not to miss any sign.
I take the south rim and Lone Wolf the north. I find horse sign up top. The two shooters on that side had tied their mounts to a tall pine tree, then skittered down a steep arroyo into the canyon.
Lone reports in a long while later covered with blood from various cuts and the spill; he looks like an honest to gods savage. He drops a dead body which he had slung across his lap.
He says “The north side shooters, I never found sign of how they got in. Left their mounts on the rim too. But too much rock there too, no way to backtrack them.
“The feller I fought with took to the creek, must have gone on down a mile or more, he still hadn’t come out ‘less I missed the sign under a bush.
“So I circle back and find just that, a bush on a rock, but about ten feet out of the stream the brush ends and the bare rock is wet, then it’s just a matter of fast trackin’. Caught him takin’ a leak. I made sure it was his last leak.”
“You okay, buddy?” I ask.
“Injin too tough not to be.”
“I see why they call you Wolf.”
We once again meet up with Sir Jake and Spud at Sir Jacob’s hilltop barbeque pit, where he is cookin’ up some fine grass fed beef. After a drink to warm us up, Michael shows up and we get down to sharing info.
We relate our experience, then Michael reports, “I found a few cows in the brush and on the way through the canyon they pulled the usual mass escape in that big thicket, which we oughta chop down in fact. Anyhoo, when I got in there, Buddy decided he was a might thirsty so I got off to quench my thirst too.”
“Exciting report so far,” I intone.
“Not to worry, here comes the punch line,” says Sir Jacob.
“In fact you are right, here it comes, how did you know Sir Jacob?”
“Educated guess.”
“Don’t steal my thunder, handsome. I lean down to take a drink and notice a mighty bright shine there in the water. Low and behold, I pick up the shiner and it is a gold nugget or chispa as my people say. And I am staking my claim as I speak.” He passes the nugget to me.
“Actually Michael, you may have that one, since it is only fist sized,” says Sir Jacob.
“Only?” I heft it. “Must weigh two pounds easy, worth a barrelful a cash. It is yore country, fellas, and since Jacob already seems to know about it, are you willing to let us in on the secret?”
“Ah, well, you see that is how I bankrolled my operation hereabouts. There is gold in the creek, I found it when we were building this wilderness. I placer mined. It started out just like the first fellers to find the American River in Californy. Those gentlemen were riding along the river, looked down and saw gold nuggets on a river bar. They had no gold pans, so they went to the Digger Injins and traded for baskets. They panned that gold with woven Digger baskets and made an intolerable amount in just a few days. Big gold nuggets right there next to the river, and likely more under the water. Ah, the Californy Gold Rush of 1849.
“I thought that we had cleaned out all the surface gold, guess that storm the other day turned the rocks over and flushed another chunk out. Mayhaps the shooters found something of the kind. Gold does make a greedy person murderous. Just about any person gets greedy at the sight of it laying about free for the taking.”
“Yep,” says Spud, “that’s why me, Jakey and Wolf are at each other’s throats. Don’t never turn yore back.”
“Sheeit, we are willing to share, even with white folks,” Wolf says as he smiles at Michael and me. “We been through the wars with you two. I think there may be enough to go around.”
“It ain’t rich no more. We done cleaned up the easy stuff years back. Now it’s more like work and with the wilderness rules we can only use hand tools. Lotta work. That first bunch of nuggets grubstaked us all up. But that windfall seems to be over,” adds Spud. “We are happy to ranch for a living now. Them cattle get in yore blood as you know, better to own them than just chouse ‘em around. I was just a cowhand like you two before the gold strike. Spending my paycheck to party. Livin’ from one to the next.
“Plus with you two on board, that makes five of us to keep these bad guys off our land. If they found the gold? Even worse, if they talked to anyone else about it? We could be in deep shit.”
“‘The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present’- Abraham Lincoln,” Sir Jacob reminds us.
“Speaking of wilderness, you said some about building this wilderness. How do you build a wilderness, Sir Jacob?” I ask. “I thought they were born, not made.”
“In fact this place was a lot less than wilderness in some areas. We came in with a huge crew, we blasted and bulldozed a veritable shitload of ruins, big ones. Picked up, cleaned out, then let nature take its course and make it wild again. The flora and fauna will out, we just speeded the process up for esthetic considerations. We reaped fantastic paychecks for remote and hazardous duty.
“That is how I ended up living here, I found the cave, stuck my backhoe into the big room. Once it was out of sight I got provisions in by freight wagon and took up housekeeping. They never noticed that I didn’t clear out with the rest of the cleanup crew. They likely figured I was another MIA, I would imagine. Took a little planning, and well worth it.”
“So yore dead?”
“On a list somewhere, I suppose.”
“And the gold?’
“Found it later, myself and Spud, out hunting. Nice timing too, as we had been speaking of the unspeakable choice of leaving paradise to go to work or remain and live on roots and grubs,” adds Sir Jacob.
“Yep, it was a question of if we could actually make it living off the land or have to go off planet and work for the Centrists. They have all the money ever’where these days, it seems,” Spud says.
“With finding this gold grubstake it became a rich land and living off it was easy,” says Sir Jacob.
“‘Course, no tellin’ if or when it’ll run out. No guarantees. We have certainly scooped the cream. Lot of hard work, not much gold last we tried,” Spud added.
“But Michael’s nugget?”
“Could be an anomaly,” says Sir Jacob, “could be the next big strike, also. Unfortunately, the odds are on anomaly.”
“Given this discovery we maybe better leave open as a possibility the conclusion that they were together, found the gold and started argyin’. And shootin’ naturally follered that. Them fellers bein’ of a lesser moral stature than us truly, not that we are interested in sharing outside the inner circle ourselves. Let the world remain dumb,” says Spud. “So, we have the Sacred Injin Cave Ceremony, and now Gold Fever as our possible motives. Things are not panning down to one conclusion quite as easily as we had hoped.
“And, almost forgot, beefleggers,” adds Spud.
“Beefleggers are just cattle rustlers, right?” I ask.
“True, beefleggin’ is often done by rustlers, they kinda own the name. They steal cows and sell them to the veggers.  We, on the other hand, raise cattle. Ain’t thieves. Beef’s worth money, more steady, fingers crossed, than prospectin’. Keeps bread on our tables.”
“But if everyone hereabouts is a vegger, who do you sell the cattle to?” I ask. “Ain’t it illegal to sell to veggers?”
“At first we only had enough cows to feed the local town here, MadDog.
“But as our herds grow we need new customers so we have expanded to some small outlaw colonies around the galaxy and, hell girl, we are beefleggers of a sort, too. We just raise cattle for the beef and then sell to the veggers, we’re not rustlers. We are the good guys. The Federals just don’t happen to agree that selling beef to veggers is legal. Meat is contraband.”
“However,” adds Sir Jacob, “any crime against the federals is an act of revolution for our side. Extremism in defense of free choice is not wrong. ‘Tis not ‘til the war is over that history is written, thence the winner becomes the good guy and the loser the bad. Of course, only the winners agree with the history books, the losers remember the other side of the story.
“Center claims people was always naturally vegger, but in the Hollywood stories they talk of sirloin steak, not soy steak. I think it’s a government line of bullshit myself. If they didn’t eat beef back then, why did they raise it? If they didn’t raise it why are there so many stories of ranchers and cowboys?”
“And barbeques?” I add.
“Now our herds are expanding, we gotta ship further. Shame to pass a planet without selling some cows, far apart as planets are. There is a market for meat even on the most dedicated vegger colonies. Some folks just like it,” Spud tells me.
“Centrists were just about all veggers for a while. They kinda forget about meat ‘til they get a smell of bacon, then we get the converts. Many can overcome the desire because of their devotion to the vegger movement, much like a religion. However, others backslide. And we got their drug. Since it is illegal, they pay a premium price; in exchange we suffer the risk of gettin’ caught.”
“But a matter of tripping lightly past the Centrist Bobbies,” reminds Sir Jacob. “They are mighty precocious Bobbies and armed, unlike their British predecessors. They joined up with the Aussies and armed themselves to the teeth.”
“They got much the same armament that we do, only newer, more advanced, and have bottomless ammo budgets. As usual,” says Spud, “they ain’t the underdog. We is.”



15  Snuck


Four days later Lone reports in after another, longer ride. “I have ridden  a rodeada, all around the country,” he says, “and finally found their camp. They are staying in that old line cabin on out in Tatonka. Seem to be a bunch of city slickers out messin’ around in our country. Never did find out what they were up to.”
“Did you find out anything else?” I ask.
“By the spirits, you won’t believe it. I snuck in close enough to hear them fellers, when they come back to look for the body. They are plain clothes Federals, the same ones who were in the gunfight. Turns out we were collateral damage. Annie and I spooked ‘em, and the black haired feller took a potshot. The bullet plowed a furrow in the air straight past her ear and continued on to hit his boss man across the clearing. So the bunch of them are plotting the usual snake in the grass rewrite, to save their own asses. They are going to arrest us or anyone else they can pin it on for the crime. We gotta skedaddle, any poor asshole found in these parts is gonna get framed and spend life in the penitentiary for killing this high Federal muckety muck.”
“Can’t they just blockade and pull us over on the trail through the canyon?” I ask. “ We are boxed in here.”
“That is exactly what could happen,” says Spud.
“Then can we hole up at Sir Jacob’s?”
“Naw. We need to be out there in MadDog getting our alibi fixed in place.”
I look at Sir Jacob and say, “What about Headless and friend?”
“Cut up, examined and disposed of, no evidence remains to be found my dear.”
“We want to be sure they don’t stick around looking too close at things. We sure don’t want Jakey’s Hole in the Rock to be found,” says Spud.
“So how do we get out?” 
“There’s only one way off this planet baby, and that’s with me,” says Spud with a laugh.
“Huh?”
“Rockchuck.
“If we ride over the mountains to avoid the roadblock in the canyon, we will be a couple of days getting into town. If we Rockchuck it, we will be in today. They’ll figure there is no way time wise we could have been here at all. We just got to be sure and get noticed in town.”
“Rockchuck it? What the hell is that?” I ask.
“Oh yeah, you’re new here. Just follow me,” says Spud.
We head into the creek and wade slowly up maybe a half mile, then we hightail it into another granite badlands maze, and by golly if there ain’t a little ship hid up in there. Just enough for five folks and their horses. We sling the horses in the hold and Spud mans the wheel. By now it has been dark a few hours and honest folk are asleep in their beds.
“Strap in boys, and be sure your head is back against the headrest. This thing packs a wallop.
“Ready?” asks Spud.
“Yes sir,” I say.
Sir Jacob handles the countdown. “3-2-1.”
 Other than the wind of movement through the air, the ship erupts from the ground noiselessly.
“Holy moly!” I exclaim. “ My face feels purt’ near tore off! A bit of G force there, you coulda warned me.”
“Remember the head against the head rest? That was the warning.”
“Welcome to Sir Jacob’s rubber band air plane,” says Wolf.
Spud drawls, “Yep, it’s a bit more G’s than airships pull on takeoff.”
“A bit? Hah! No wonder you sling the horses,” I say.
“Hang on, we’re going in.”
“Where the fuck we goin’ in to?”
“The ship,” says Spud.
The Rockchuck docks against a Starship, who knew. Before I get untangled from the seat belt the hatch opens. We go aboard.
“Nice big freighter,” I say. We are standing on a catwalk overlooking a huge cargo deck.
“Needs a few things,” says Spud.
“She’s got air.”
“Got a mechanic to get her up and runnin’ again, and a good pilot. Here he comes.”
A lanky feller in a space suit carrying his helmet saunters in.
“Howdy cowboys, welcome aboard S. S. Cosmic,” he says.
“This here is Sky. Sky, meet Annie and Michael.”
“Howdy.”
“Pleasure.”
“Sky is our pilot today. And, ironically, his name is Sky Pilot.”
“Thanks, Spud,” Sky says sarcastically. “My Ma had a plan when she named me Sky. She was a real stargazer.
“But at the moment I am more like the maintenance crew. I’ve been going over the outer shell today, why it’s all aired up now. Plus, for me to breathe. Like they say on the water, a small leak can sink a big ship,” says Sky.
We all stand and stare out the windshield at the stars and the Rock far below.
Sky mumbles, “And together we shall rule the galaxy.”
“Say what?” I ask.
“Nothing,” Sky muses.
Spud leads us off of the bridge and out into the cargo hold.
As we walk Sir Jacob says, “Surely it’s not his real name?”
“Naw. Just the Sky. I christened him with the Pilot; being, in his words, a smartass. I like to think of myself as more of a godlike figure. Maybe y’all should address me as Captain Mullens.”
“We got one too many hoity toity royals around here already.” I snicker.
“I beg to differ. I consider myself to bring a civilizing influence to a primitive world populated by,” says Sir Jacob as he sweeps an arm to include us all, “little more than apes.”
“Maybe he had a different name in the Center but since he arrived here and I made the joke, that’s how he introduces himself,” says Spud.
“That happened in the opening of new frontiers all through history. A man...”
“Or woman,” I add meaningfully.
Spud nods, squeezes my arm and says, “hmm.
 “...with a shady past could move out to the edge and reinvent himself. Of course in Sky’s case it’s hard to ditch the crazy.”
“Guess that’s true of all of us. We like to think the people in the Center are crazy. But there are so many of them, if they really were crazy wouldn’t it be the tendency of the species to die off?” I ask.
“I like to think of it as a checks and balances system. If they were all sane like ourselves who would start the wars and genocides that keep the population in check? Too many superior folk like us and we might have peace and harmony in our time,” says Sir Jacob.
“Submits the man with at least four weapons on his person as he speaks,” says Spud.
“Six and they’re not weapons, they’re Peacemakers. Sam Colt had it right.”
“I like to consider them Peacekeepers myself,” say I.
Spud waves an arm at the hold. “Fortunately, we were able to salvage this old cowboy pickup truck from a seriously wrecked condition. We pieced it back together and found a spare parts engine. Hell, she’s almost as good as gold now.
“Nice amenities on board, we can travel in comfort. Just a few can crew her.”
“Spud? I thought you were a wilderness rancher, horses, cows, caves, log cabins, wood stoves, what the fuck?”
“We can deliver our own beef, not be beholdin’ to the big freight companies. They seem to eat up all our profits right now.
“A feller’s gotta earn a living, this here will be the new Cosmic stock truck. We deliver to the carnivore worlds. Not too many of them, mostly veggers in the cosmos. I hear that before the Troubles such was not the case, though the veggers don’t tell you that. But in all them Old West tales, by golly, a barbequed burger was, still is, the real deal. Cattle ranches weren’t just for dudes to play at back in them days.
“Like I said, we use her to deliver cattle to market. Gotta sneak in and out of the veg worlds, so the government goblins don’t find us. The carnivore worlds are not so bad, just way out at the edges of the Cosmos where the veggies don’t hold the power. Long journeys. But with warp, we can shine time on.
“Never have to be under the boot heels of nobody again. We get lucky and find cargo on the turn around to keep food on the table.”
“Get her runnin’ again?” asks Wolf.
“Yeah.”
“Broke down now?”
“No, she’s runnin’, just slow,” says Spud.
“No warp speed?”
“Not so much, she ran for a bit yesterday. Then quit.
“Sky has her back now to where she’ll idle about some. Man’s makin’ good progress.”
“If she can’t go nowhere, then why are we here?” asks Michael.
I say, “This tour is interesting but I’m right confused, thought we were headed to MadDog.”
“We are, this is just a diversion,” says Spud. “Like I said on the ground, we ride straight in out of the wilderness, looks like we could be the shooters.”
“We are now arriving from outer space, haven’t been on the Rock for a fortnight,” says Sir Jacob. “Don’t forget.”
“We drop in out of space. We been off prospecting the asteroids. Got mineral samples in the hold to prove it,” continues Spud. “They are here, in these bins, came with the ship.”
“Does anyone hear a hissing sound?” asks Wolf.
“Sky!” yells Spud.
“I hear it,” Sky yells back. He slides down the bridge escape pole, just like a firehouse, and runs by suited up, stuffing his helmet back on. “Oh crap, excuse my French.” He passes through a hatch, dogs it down and heads for the airlock.
After a mite he reappears.
“Just a loose bolt in the exhaust, wrench, little caulking. No problema.”
“Knew you were the man for the job, Sky.” Spud turns to us. “Come on everybody, let’s head down to MadDog. Catch you on the flyby Sky.”
“Adios.”
Holy cowpies, now I am a secret agent girl.




16  Dim Lights, Small City


We load into the shuttle and Spud runs us down to MadDog.
“Tell me again why didn’t we just hop the Rockchuck in out of the wilderness?”
“Sharp eyeballs could spot us. Best to not take the chance.”
“Unpowered? Not possible. With all that g-force?”
“I told you Sir Jacob was somthin’. It is a slingshot, he invented it.”
Sir Jacob chimes in, “Just really an update of the old time slings on aircraft carriers. Mine is simple, quiet, a tad bit larger, and it effectively does the job.”
“With no lights, just the whoosh, it is gone quick and it only makes the one noise, hell them cidiots likely think it’s frogs croakin’. They are scared of every noise out there. Maybe they’ll hightail it out. Be funny,” adds Spud.
“Cidiots?”
“City idiots. You ever notice they seem half dim?”
“Well, yeah, just never heard the word.
“They called Michael and I ‘hicks’ when we worked near Center. Seemed hilarious, they knew so little. Couldn’t even saddle a bronc, much less fork him. Jealous, I reckon.”
“I must say, in their defense, that they are not so much cidiots as persons of a different skill set. However, I find myself, as a former cidiot, often boggled by your range of skills. A myriad more than one needs in the city. Things being much more specialized and persons much more interdependent in town. Here one must be a master of virtually all skills.”
“So, you got the slingshot. Have you got beaming up?” I ask.
“Myth,” says Wolf.
“You think?”
“That’s just an old wives tale.”
“I heard the Trek system has it,” I say.
“Those guys? We had a bunch of them visit here. Total whack jobs. Not a one of them could even ride a horse. Hell, they didn’t even figure out how to mount a horse. I mean that is as basic as life gets. How could they possibly do something as advanced as beam? ‘Specially since it is a lost art,” Wolf says, shaking his head.
“Actually,” I say, “them guys don’t have horses. Not everyone rides or even needs to. They got them car things, just get in, tell ‘em where you want to go, and zip, yore off. No reins or nothing, just a moving box. It’s weird. And scary fast. I rode in one oncet. No room for my horse inside though. Had to give it up.”
“Food for thought,” says Sir Jacob.
Spud takes us to a friend’s house and we get a bath and put on our duds for the evening.
Spud has a funny look on his face when he sees I am in a dress.
Wolf ogles me and says, “Hell. You clean up nice, little girl.”
“Close yore mouths, boys, afore yore tongues hit the floor,” I say.
“Let’s go get us a drink,” says Michael.
“Now yore talkin’.” I agree.
“You two proceed. We shall arrive momentarily,” says Sir Jacob.
Michael and I head to the Short Branch Saloon, the only game in a one horse town.
We saunter in through the swinging doors, just like in the stories, and belly up to the bar. 
“Whiskey, beer back, for two,” I say.
We lean our elbows on the bar and squint up at the big sign by the mirror:
‘Please keep weapons safely holstered until the need arises, then shoot to kill.’
Our kind of place.
“Busy tonight. What occasion is this?” Michael asks the redhead behind the bar. His Spanish accent is coming out strong.
I hadn’t spent too much time in MadDog. But I had been in the bar when we first arrived for roundup and noticed the bartender; she is as cute as a bug and twice as tough. I wouldn’t be surprised to find she had a shotgun hid behind the bar.
She delivers our drinks and says, “Welcome, my friends, to the show that never ends.”
I slide some bills across the bar.
“No need, that fella in the corner over there seems to be celebratin’, he’s buying your rounds. Small town, word of free drinks gets around, everyone gets thirsty,” she says.
“Thanks!” I yell to the duded up feller in the corner, wearing brand new ‘cowboy’ duds and sporting a handlebar mustache. Nary a cowpie has ever touched his city ass, and every crease is still in place.
“Bueno!” says Michael, then lifts his glass and offers a toast. “Salud, querida!”
“Cheers, Tio!” I say.
We set ‘em down fer a refill. Barkeep pours and I raise my glass.
“Ay caramba. Where are your manners, young lady? We will go over and thank the gentleman in person,” says Michael, whose Spanish accent is back in spades now.
He saunters over to the table, looking as sexually straight as an arrow. Always hilarious. I gotta cover my mouth and cough to hide the laughter. Michael does a great Spanish nobleman.
“Mighty kind of you, Señor, you are a gentleman,” he says.
“Pull up a chair,” says the mustachioed one. “Take a load off.”
Michael hesitates. “Allow me first to introduce myself, Señor. I am Don Miguel Santa Cruz of the Rancho Fin del Mundo on Nuevo España. Mucho gusto en conocerle.
“And this lovely thing is the esteemed Señorita Anna Rockefeller. We are here de vacaciones. A beautiful planet this is for fun. And maybe we will find a few trinkets, ah, souvenirs, to commemorate our vacation.”
“Pleasure to meet you. I am Jonathon Soames.” He shakes Miguel’s hand and kisses mine.
“You are from this area?” asks Miguel.
“I am now. Fortune has smiled upon me to be stationed on a planet with such beautiful visitors.” He looks at me as he says it, but he winks at the irrepressible Don Miguel, who bats an eye slightly. Me thinks these two will be having a clandestine meeting later. Gaydar!
“Where, Don Miguel, did you find such a delightful creature?”
Jonny smiles at me again. Is this putz looking for a threesome? So much for gaydar, I’ll never learn to read these things. Michael kicks me under the table. Guess I been out on the range too long. Can’t think of anything else.
“She is quite beautiful, I agree,” says Miguel.
“Your English is very good, Don Miguel.”
“Mil gracias, I thank you,” says Miguel and tilts his head.
“Here, let us have another round and discuss treasures. I may have knowledge of a trinket or two to your liking,” says Soames.
“Ah, we maybe have business in common after all, one never knows.”
“Miss Rockefeller, you travel with Don Miguel?”
“She is, in fact, my sister’s daughter. I would say my niece, but I know that to have an unfortunate double meaning en Ingles.
“Ah, this is a bit delicato, aver, ah, I am escorting her home to her mother. My esteemed sister, Velaria, who married a tall, excuse the word, gringo. She take after her father in height and also temperament. She is young and rebellious. You see, she run away. I catch her and return her home.”
“Uncle Miguel!” I stare at the table and try to look contrite and embarrassed, but don’t know how, which is embarrassing, so it works out.
“I cannot let her out of my sight. I hired a dueña, how you say, a chaperone for her, but the woman quit after Annie bite her hand while trying to escape. I fear for her virginity in this rough frontier, but my negocios, my business, must also be done.”
“Tio Miguel.” I stamp my foot. “It is unseemly to speak so frankly to a stranger!” This time I really do blush, actually turn bright red because I am holding my breath to restrain the laughter. My virginity, hah. Wouldn’t be the first time I lost it, nor the second, neither.
“My dear, you must respect your elders. As you know, I am a superior judge of character. I can already tell that Mister Soames is, like me, a man of substance and good will. He is simpatico. You should judge all men to this high standard. A girl of your advanced age must be finding a husband before you begin to wither.”
“Like a heifer on the auction block?” I smile.
“Anna, watch what you say!
“May I ask your pardon, Señor Soames. We should not bore you with our silly family troubles.
“Allow me to inquire, let us speak of your family. Your wife, she must be very beautiful to have such a powerful husband?”
Soames preens and says, “In fact, Señor Santa Cruz, I have never been married.”
He gives me a googly eyed fish look which I am sure he thinks is flirtatious. Yuck.
“Ah, I see. You are of the age when successful men need a gorgeous wife to advance their career, and one of good family would be the best.”
Now Soames is looking at me exactly like a prize heifer. He smiles and winks, openly leering at me. Then his tongue comes out. Oy!
Miguel turns to me and smiles blandly. He is having too much fun with this. I mentally stick my finger down my throat and gag.
“Yes, Querida, an established, mature man like Señor Soames here would be just perfect for a rambunctious girl like you.
 “She is a beautiful and spirited young woman; however, a strong, macho husband could easily get her into line.”
Soames looks me up and down again.
“I like a challenge,” he says.
I stand up and put my hands on my hips. “I do not give a fuck. If you are looking for a girl who gives a fuck, look somewhere fucking else. Hmph!” I toss my hair over my shoulder and stomp off to the Ladies can.
Behind me I can hear Don Miguel continuing to grease the wheel.
“I didn’t understand before, Señor Soames, for whom it is you work?”
“Don, ah, Señor Santa Cruz,” Soames says and puffs his little self up. “I am the newly appointed representative, a sort of emissary if you will, of the Centrist government to the people of the Rock. We at the center of civilization have a new program to try to embrace our distant, less fortunate colonies. They need our every assistance.”
Ah, he must indeed smell treasure. He, like many of his ilk, comes here to rape and pillage.
A commotion occurs at the door to the bar. I swear I hear horns of heraldry and sure ‘nough, Sir Jacob, in his finest attire, makes his entrance with a cowboyed up Spud and then the resplendent Lone Wolf, in full Injin regalia, a few respectful paces behind.
Spud yells, “We ain’t here for a long time, we’re here for a good time!”
“Yo cousins, where y’all been? Spaced out?” the barkeep calls.
She comes around the bar.
“Cheers, Charley darling.” Jacob sweeps her up into his arms. “We have, or so it seems, been off planet forever. Space walking,to be sure.”
“Space walking?”
“Nah, you know Jakey, he’s always a little spaced out,” says Spud, grabbing a hug of his own. 
“We was asteroid prospectin’, found some promising color. Run out of provisions, we’re back.”
“By provisions him mean firewater. Set us up,” says Wolf, getting a hug and a big smooch.
I head back to Soames table looking contrite and say, “I am very sorry Tio Miguel, Señor Soames. I let my anger get the better of me. It is a rough time for me. Please forgive me.” I sit demurely down.
Soames is staring at the bar. He rises and is suddenly in a hurry to leave, “Pardon me, Señor Santa Cruz, I have business to attend to. Here is my card, I am staying at the Granite Grand Hotel should you be in need of any assistance. Although I must say the term Grand is a bit of a stretch. Primitive planets have not the amenities of the civilized zone.”
We all rise from the table. “It is my most fervent hope that we shall meet again. Enjoy your stay, Miss Rockefeller.” He bows and kisses my hand again.
Soames heads for the door holding his hat on the right side of his face, thereby hiding his looks from the boys at the bar, and then as he goes through the door he finally gets it settled up top.
After he is out the door I whisper to Miguel, “Ugh, remind me to wear gloves in future.” I trot off down the hall back into the Ladies to scrub the offending lip feel off the back of my hand.
As I step out the door of the Ladies, I smile at Spud who is loitering there and say, “Remember, we don’t know each other.”
“I think the gutter slime that just left is our man,” says Spud.
“Could be, but his compadres may still be here. Also, word travels fast in small towns. Shit, here comes someone.”
Spud wraps his arms around me, bends me over for a big smooch, nuzzles my ear and whispers, “Slap me hard.”
“My pleasure,” I say.
I pull away and...
‘Bam!’
...slap Spud on the cheek.
Spud reels, almost falling over. “What the hell lady, I just wanted a little sugar,” and stumbles drunkenly back to Wolf and Sir Jacob. He huddles up with Wolf, telling him a quiet tale which includes pointing and gesturing at me and a right smart bout of laughter on their part.
I return to the table where ‘Tio’ Miguel is sitting, telling him loudly and tearfully, “That filthy, unwashed cowpuncher tried to have his way with me!”
Michael stands and says, “Señor, I must ask that you meet me outside. You have attempted to sully the reputation of my niece! I must fight for her honor.”
Spud and Lone snicker. 
Spud says, “Hell, you might as well turn her out fer coin, no one will ever marry a big ugly loud mouthed girl like that. Long in the tooth, too.”
Miguel saunters over and slaps Spud with his gloves.
“Outside!” yells the now shotgun wielding bartender. I knew she had one back there.
Out we all head, chagrined.
Some groundhog who has never seen the outside of a bottle and can’t wait for the action to start takes a swing at Sir Jacob on the way out the door, saying, “Hey, you pansy ass dude.” 
Turning into the punch, Sir Jacob executes a fancy English barfly flip.
Groundhog’s friends converge around Sir Jacob.
Spud stands groggily, revolver in hand, saying, “I’ll shoot a man in a fair fight. Or if he’s about ta start a fair fight.”
“That’s crazy. You can’t just shoot people like the old time cowboys did,” exclaims Michael.
“Oh, I beg to differ, we surely can, this is the Rock,” Sir Jacob reminds him.
A fat guy in a suit shakes an arm and a derringer emerges into his hand, just as a knife appears in front of his windpipe with Wolf’s fingers around the handle.
Soon the whole bar is outside and a’ fightin’.
Michael has adjourned from the fray and found ‘Señor’ Soames down the boardwalk, where they stand, being ‘gentlemen’, and watch. They are a ways away and Soames has his hat brim pulled low over his eyes.
I, as the errant niece, am careful to throw a few epithets and weak punches at Sir Jacob’s bunch to be sure the Fed knows I ain’t with them. Then Wolf grabs me and plants a big smoocheroo on my mouth, my knees melt and I fall to the floor. ‘Uncle’ Miguel runs over to defend my honor and... 
‘Pow.’
 ...Wolf gets it on the chin. As he falls to the ground he winks at me.
Then Miguel turns and punches at whoever is biting him and Spud’s eye gets in the way of his fist. Ouch.
Miguel manages to smash a couple of guys off their feet before moving back up on the boardwalk. He throws one diehard down with some fancy karate move and hogties him with his silk scarf. Careful, of course, never to mess up his coif.
Eventually some Johnny Law with a shiny badge and a big hog leg shows up and we all get arrested and inevitably poured into the pokey. Not really my favorite kind of an evening.
Who are these guys? Do I want to get involved with them? At this point though, after the two kisses, I was so hot for Spud and Wolf, I doubt this thought even crossed my mind. Maybe it should have. The fisticuffs had proved all them muscles were not just window dressing. They kicked ass.
Early next morning, still half dark, the sheriff comes in and says, “Rise and shine. Your girlfriend made bail. You need to get out of my jail now, save me feedin’ ya breakfast.”
After we have a while to rub the sleep out of our eyes, Charley comes in and says, “Let’s go boys.”
“We need to get out of here now,” says Sir Jacob.
“Yeah, that’s what the sheriff said.”
We collect our arsenal, get buckled back in, and rub our aching heads.
“Hey, where’s Michael?” I ask.
“Last I saw him was last night, he was talking up that Federal guy. He must have looked too respectable to haul off to the pokey,” says Sir Jacob.
As we stagger out onto the boardwalk, Charley says, “You all seem to have made up overnight. Come on down to my place for some hair of the dog.”
So we head for the Short Branch, which is closed before noon. We arrive and happily settle our asses onto some of the empty chairs.
Charley sets us up with Bloody Yankees. “I want to thank you kindly for takin’ it outside rather than breakin’ my expensive bar accoutrements.”
“The shotgun got our attention,” says Wolf.
“Come to find out that smarmy fella Soames turned you in to the Sheriff fer fightin’. I guess he was trying to make points with Señor Santa Cruz,” says Charley.
Michael wanders in looking happy.
I smile and ask, “How was your night ‘Tio’?”
“Alright, I did it. I did. I got lucky last night,” admits Michael. “He may be the bad guy, but he was fun. And I’m in.”
Spud turns a bit green and says, “We’ll try not to picture that. Anyhoo, Charley, this here is Annie, and Michael. They’ll do. Meet Charley, the owner.”
“Pleasure.”
Charley is a curvaceous redhead. Very stacked. Big smile, perfect for a bar owner. Folks have to order another drink just to see her lean over the bar in her low cut dress. Cleavage city. I am green with envy.
We sip for a bit, then Wolf starts it off, “Hey, Spud, good thing yore in the cattle business.”
Spud is holding his head in his hands, lookin’ pretty miserable. He peers up and says, “Huh?”
“‘Cause yore gonna need plenty steak for that shiner.”
Spud’s eye is a swollen and sickly colored mess.
“Yeah, good thing you were already ugly otherwise that shiner would have spoiled yore looks. Haw haw,” I pile it on. Always jump on a feller when he’s down, I say.
I turn to Charley and ask, “What got a smart, good lookin’ gal like you in the bar business?”
“I started on the pole, worked, slaved, saved, stayed away from the excess drink, drugs. I had a goal, be my own boss by 30 and by god, now I am. Come to the frontier where land is cheap and men are thirsty. Set myself up. And only 28 to boot.”
We commence to toast about everything in the Cosmos, just plain happy to be alive.
After a big appreciative gulp, Lone touches his head and yelps, “Shit, my ear hurts, feels about tore off.”
“Hmm, maybe red man have too much firewater.” I chortle.
“You were the guy who forgot to take it outside; you hit some guy then turned over a table. That is how I got you outside, the old ear lobe hold. Renders men helpless,” Charley informs him.
“What did you use, your teeth?”
“Pliers.” Charley laughs.
Wolf touches his ear, more gingerly this time. “Ow, I thought you were red man’s friend.”
Charley smiles and says, “I might have taken my part a bit too seriously.”
She turns to Spud and asks, “That alibi enough for you Spud? Ain’t a person in the whole town didn’t hear you boys hollerin’ and shootin’. Everybody knows you are here.”
“And no one knows who was on what side; at this point even I’m not sure,” I say, feeling dazed and confused.
Spud just groans. We all head outside.
Charley, who is walking off down the boardwalk, turns and smiles at us. All the guys perk up and their eyes light up, bruises and hangovers momentarily forgotten.
“What woke you guys up?” I ask.
Spud says, “Charley is a sight better endowed than the most of women.”
“We were just perusing her anatomy to be sure she is taking proper care of herself,” adds Sir Jacob.
“Sorry guys, that’s only a temporary cure, yore heads’ll be hurtin’ just as bad as mine again in a minute.”
We trudge down to the livery, gather our horses, and skulk out of town in different directions.



17  Federales


Having evaded the Federals in the person of ‘Señor’ Soames, we were feeling mighty cocky. But we shouldn’t a’ been. Our cattle are all gathered up in one small unit and need to be moved on to the ship and off of the planet before they use up the feed.
After I get shed of town, I backtrack and meet up with Spud and Wolf.
“Thank the gods that Charley has an in with the sheriff,” I say.
Spud and Wolf laugh.
 “I got something you need to see,” says Spud.
This meant going back in through the scene of the crime. We dasn’t sneak around the canyon, it would look too suspicious. And as Wolf pointed out, our renewed passing through the area would serve to confusticate any investigators that might be snooping about. So we ride right into the eye of the hurricane, singing ‘Old Paint’ at the top of our voices, thus hoping to prewarn these dumb ass cocksuckers of our approach.  We don’t care to get shot up yet again.
After we get through Dead Horse Draw, Lone leaves us saying, “I got Injin business.”
Spud and I continue on companionably together.
As we top a rise, we can see a rider speeding toward town.
“What’s his hurry?” I ask.
“Cayuse Express. Neither rain, nor sleet, nor snow, nor dark of night, nor prairie dog hole shall keep the Cayuse Express from their routes,” says Spud.
“Oh, yeah, I’ve heard about those guys.” Mostly heard they are hot young studs.
“Yep, I was one for a while. Wolf, too.”
Yup, hot young studs.
“Not a job for the timid,” continues Spud. “They really have it rough. The Cayuse Express Boys used to be another outfit, the Pony Express, a few hundred years and many generations of fast ponies back. The Cayuse riders ride at a full gallop on the best stretches of trail all over the wilderness. Folks are scarce out here, few and very far between. A letter is the way to talk privately across the land. The mail boys run three times a week. They have the Express schedule to keep and miles to cover between sleeps.
“They run a short stretch between Express stations, where a fresh horse is saddled by the station workers and ready to run. The rider has but to jump off, flip their saddlebags onto the next horse, hop aboard and fly again. Them ponies know the trail and make it their business to do it right. True they don’t always run flat out, they have to pace theirselves so as not to kill their horses, or roll the horses and kill theirselves. But, if the ground can handle it they go from a fast lope to a full run in the straight open stretches.
“So ever’ other day or so, a flash of speeding horseflesh can suddenly round the bend and scare the bejesus out of you and your horse.”
“Adds to the excitement of life,” I say.
“Yep. We trail the skittish stock on non-Express routes when we can or non-Express days if we can’t. Not always possible in long stretches of rough terrain.
“Don’t see them out where you were rounding up cattle so much. No houses out there.”
Cayuse Express, the spice of life. Hot, young riders, too.
Lawsy me, I’m gettin’ excited again.




18  Spud’s Place


Riding down the draw Spud and I reach a vantage point with a fabulous view down to the beach. Below us is a sprawling log edifice, majestic by Rock standards, which is one or two rooms for the most part. Being a newly settled land, most creature comforts are a dim dream for the future.
“Now that there’s a fine spread,” I say. “Like to build one like that myself someday. How about you?”
“I like my place just like it is now.”
“This too fancy for the likes of you, eh?”
Spud shakes his head and laughs.
As we approach the place I see that it is built of huge pine logs notched and set tight to keep out the weather.
We ride on down the draw and up to the fabulously carved front door. Spud dismounts and opens the door. 
“My humble abode,” he says.
“Holy cats and dogs, you must have the building bug.”
“Did.”
After we put the horses up, Spud takes me inside.
“Welcome to my lair. I have a bottle of Sir Jakey’s finest. Shall we indulge ourselves?”
“Let’s do,” I say in awe.
“Have a seat.”
While I settle on the overstuffed leather sofa, Spud grabs a bottle from behind the log and antler adorned bar and pours us a drink.
“Bottoms up.”
“Damn, I was thirsty,” and nervous, and gettin’ kinda hot and bothered. I slug down mine and go fer another.
“You know, a few years back,” says Spud, “there was a fiesta in Cowtown on Triassic. That is where you hail from, right?”
“It is.”
“I went to this harvest fiesta lookin’ for some fun. I spotted this cute little pigtailed girl twirling around in a red mariachi skirt. Never have forgot her.
“The music was rocking and I was watching this beautiful girl, finally I told myself to man up, for just 10 seconds. My Pa used to say 10 seconds of courage can change yore life. So I bucked myself up, walked over and asked if she wanted to dance.
“Quick as a flash she pulled a derringer out of her garter and pointed it at me.
“I said, ‘Guess that means yes,’ and sure ‘nough we danced.”
“Shit, that was me, but that was Walter who asked, a little skinny kid from out of town.”
“You’ve growed a bit, Annie. I didn’t recognize you at first. So have I, I’m still Walter, but most folks these days call me Spud. Something about a potato cannon I built back then. Sure had a lot of fun with that sucker. Always did like shootin’ things.”
I was floored. “Well, I’ll be damned. Walter. You grew up also, filled out too.”
“The Annie fooled me too, but then I heard that Federal fella Soames call you Señorita Rockefeller. I been studying on you ever since. You really are Rocky Rockefeller, ain’t ya?”
“Roxanne.”
Spud stares at me a minute. “Haw haw. Naw, I remember now, the boys there called you Roxy Rocks! Yore still a pistol.”
“Gawd that was a long time ago. Ain’t been called Roxy Rocks in years. We was just kids.” I am truly aghast.
“Yep, stupid teenagers,” says Spud. We both nod.
“Holy cow, does that mean we’ve already done the deed?” Spud asks, then he hesitates. After a moment of thought his face turns red and he says, “Damn, I shore think we did.”
“No matter,” I say, “no law against doing it agin.
“Yeah, Walt, we’ll likely be a mite less awkward now,” say I.
“Awkward, me? Naw that was you.” by then we are both laughing.
“Sheeit” I say. “Speak for yore own self, bud. I disremember any awkwardness on my part. Ha ha ha.” Okay, I’m lying.
“I think you, Roxy Rocks, will want to dance again.”
“Parts of it are purely a blur.” I must look hesitant, or even scared shitless.
“How ‘bout we get more comfortable?” Spud pours us another glass of wine. “Follow me.”
We head out to a back porch where Spud has a fabulous pool. “Swimming? Hot swimming, that is. There is a hot springs up the draw here, why I picked the spot. Great for soaking, swimming, talking...”
We wade in and find convenient underwater boulders to sit on and enjoy our wine. After a bit of drinking, soaking and general horsing around we head back to the wine bottle for a refill.
Spud laughs and says, “So Roxy Rocks, of all the planets in all the constellations in all the galaxies of all the Cosmos, how the hell did you end up here?”
“Hey, don’t get fresh. I are a virgin,” I say, “again.”
“Seriously Roxy, you’ve been stuck in the deep corners of my mind since that dance, whatever the fuck it was. I always wondered where you went. We had such a good time, so much silly fun. It was a memorable evening.
“Then, I don’t know what happened, hell of a one nighter. It was like a time warp, something happened, remember? We were saying that if either of us invented time travel that we would travel back to that time, that spot and relive that moment.”
“OMG, what did we do after that?” I ask.
“You left. I thought it was just a one nighter to you.”
“No, I didn’t, I thought you left. I looked for you.”
“Something weird happened, I wonder what,” says Spud. “Something cosmic.”
“Ironic, isn’t it, that you named your ship Cosmic?”
“Not ironic, I remembered.”
Whoa.



19  In the Midst of Battle


I roll over in the early dawn light to look into Spud’s glittering blue eyes. “You are indeed quite the talker, Spud.”
And an even better lover. Whooeee.
“I just wanted to continue our old fiesta dialog,” Spud says and smiles. “You were my first, you know.”
“I’ll bet you say that to all the girls.”
“No Roxy, I don’t,” says Spud soberly.
“It’s okay, you had me at beautiful.”
Spud smiles his signature shit eating grin.
“In that case,” I say, “I myself will take the credit for starting you out right. I think, however, you been practicin’ some since that dance, Spud.”
“Yep, here and there. But, you really were my first, Roxanne. Wasn’t ‘til we got to MadDog and you got your hat off and a bath and put on that swirly dress that I realized who you were. Dayum girl, last night was sweet. How about another round?”
“Oh, yeah, let’s.” Our lips touch, oh my.
‘Knock, knock.’
‘Stomp, stomp.’  
Coming up the stairs.
“Oh hell,” says Spud, “that damn Wolf gets up too early.”
I say, “Yeah Wolf is here way too early, oughter make him wait on the stoop while we finish our ‘talk’.”
“Come back later!” yells Spud.
Then to me he says, “Shit, shoulda locked the bedroom door.” He glances that way. “Oh hell, he’s already in.”
Wolf is standing up in the bedroom doorway with a shit eatin’ grin on his face.
“Go away, Injin,” says Spud.
“Heck no, the little lady needs a real man, and here I am.”
Nice. Wolf is shirtless, all painted and fixed up, feathers and all. A true beauty among men. 
“Hey brother, white girl here need strong Injin man for real good time. She look happy now, but Injin make her ecstatic. Move over cowboy.”
“Kiss my ass, Injin.” Spud tries to look stern then breaks out in laughter.
“Scoot, I’ll kiss hers.”
Spud and I just lay there and smile.
“Alright,” Wolf says disgustedly. “I’ll go down and make coffee. Spoilin’ all my fun,” his voice tapers off. “If you were a true blood brother you’d share.”
‘Stomp, stomp, stomp.’
I look at Spud and say, “I thought Injins walked quiet.”
Spud grins, looks in my eyes, wiggles a little closer...mmmmmm...
Yore imagination will suffice for what happens next.
***
Thirty minutes later, as we consider thirds, a new voice is heard.
“Hallo the house,” Michael’s voice from outside. “We are heere!”
“Hell, the whole herd is showing up. Rain check, darlin’?”
“You bet! Just one last smackeroo.”
Enough commotion has occurred downstairs to cool the mood and time is awastin’ so Spud and I drag ourselves apart, dress and toddle down.
While I pour my coffee, Spud, throws an arm around my shoulder, kisses my cheek and whispers, “Wow, Roxy you really do rock!” Big kiss!
“Hell yes I do.” Corny as hell, but: Yay!
Wolf walks into the kitchen.
“Crazy white girl, him not as good as real fuck from Injin lover. ‘Once you go red, you stay in bed’,” promises Wolf.
“Sheeit! I’ve seen that little thing of yours,” says Spud, laughing. “It ain’t so much.”
“Bigger than yours, white boy. Injin grower, not shower.”
“Hey am I missing all the good cock, I mean talk?” asks a familiar not quite feminine voice.
“Yeesh, Michael’s in the building.”
Michael and Sir Jacob join us around the table, and Wolf starts pouring their coffee.
“I’ll go feed,” says Spud.
“No mind, I done it while you two were in the midst of battle. Hah, yore both blushing. It ain’t no secret. Yore just lucky to have a faithful Injin companion to keep us on schedule,” intones Wolf.
“I’ll whip up some johnny cakes while you jaw, boys,” I say.
“That done too, I got ‘em here in the bun warmer,” says Wolf.
“You’re a good enough slave, partner,” notes Spud.
“A pleasure to serve, master.” Wolf bows.
“Spud,” asks Michael, “you build this table?” The table top is one giant piece of wood.
“A slab from one huge tree. And the rest went into the staircase. It’s one piece, steps, runners, risers and all. He built the cabin you see around it, too,” says Sir Jacob.
“Wolf helped,” says Spud.
“And Sir Jacob bossed us around,” adds Wolf.
“Hell yeah, Sir Jacob worked and pontificated at the same time,” says Spud.
“Yes,” says Sir Jacob. “I am a man of many talents who can speak on innumerable subjects.”
Humble, too.
“Hell, Spud and me got the work done cause we wasn’t busy jawing,” says Lone Wolf.
“Couldn’t get a word in edgewise,” agrees Spud.



20  Lone’s Sacred Duty


We partake of a full breakfast spread with beef, beans, rashers of bacon, eggs, and johnny cakes.
“Them’s damn good frijoles Spud,” says Michael.
“Fit for the palate of a king,” adds Sir Jacob.
As I spear another knifeful of bacon I ask, “You raise this hog, Spud? Mighty flavorful.”
“Yep, homegrown.”
Sir Jacob turns and says, “Michael, if I may ask without being indelicate, did you glean any information from Jonathan Soames?”
“I tried to get the conversation along on to those lines, but to no avail. Soames just wanted to party. Man sure loves his drink, drugs, and beautiful young men like myself. As he was nice enough to mention to me.”
“Not a very helpful fella, that Soames,” I say.
“Very helpful, he said I was beautiful,” says Michael preening.
“Maybe you need a second date, if you don’t mind. Should be safe to do, we seem to have killed all the witnesses to your true allegiance,” ventures Sir Jacob.
“We’ll have to think on that, see if we can come up with a new angle,” says Spud.
“What activities have you lined up for today Wolf?” asks Sir Jacob.
Wolf says, “Let us haul this coffee in by the fire. We will sit as men, and women,” with a nod to me, “do and discuss important things.”
We move into the spacious living room and sit on soft furry cowhide couches and chairs. There are homemade tables and cabinets with antler handles, all of it fabulous handiwork.
After we get settled, Wolf stands up in front of the blazing rock fireplace.
“My friends, I have called you all together to ask a great favor.
“I walk now with a heavy heart. I have been taught my whole life to trust no one but my own people. But time is short before I must have help and my people are scattered and weak. Many have lost their way and now live in the Center with no thought or understanding of their innate Injinness.
“I must trust someone with the weight of my responsibility. My brother, Spud, I know is my sworn ally, you others have fought well and truly by my side. Injin must look as always to his friends. We are all human people.”
“‘Cept fer maybe Spud over there, he’s a super hero, I hear,” says I with a grin. “Sorry, hadda say it.”
“Shit, Injin trying to be solemn, this is sacred trust. No giggling.”
“You are right, Wolf. I, for one, shall be honored to be chosen to labour and also, if need be, to fight by your side,” says Sir Jacob. “With a small dedicated group, there is nothing that cannot be accomplished.”
“I don’t know about that Sir Jacob, but, yes, Lone Wolf, I will be honored to ride by yore side also,” says Michael.
“Count me in,” from Spud.
“If you’ll lower yore standards and take a girl, me too. We will all gladly join yore posse. Yore goals is surely ours.”
Spud asks, “What’s up, brother?”
“Show and tell is best.”
As we rise to leave I spot something.
“Ain’t that a buffalo hide on the wall?” I ask. “Where in the Worlds would you get one?”
“Ah,” answers Spud, “good timing. I’ll wager that Wolf is about to show us.”
“Let us saddle our mounts,” suggests Wolf. “It is a beautiful time for a ride. Pack enough gear for a few days. There is ground to cover.”



21  Tatonka


After a few hours ride through paradise, with pine and cedar stands thickening around us, we arrive at the pass. As we stop to rest our horses the view is breathtaking. Through the notch created by the trail we can see a green park widening out below us and there before our eyes is a herd of buffalo beyond the scope of imagination. They are plodding slowly along, eating, pawing, old bulls fighting, young calves playing, cows giving birth, a moving nomadic scene from antiquity.
Even though many are stopped, feeding, rolling, calving, mock fighting, sleeping and just plain scratching, the pattern of the whole herd is motion at all times. Slowly, inexorably advancing together across a seemingly limitless sea of grass.
“Nature’s playground,” says Sir Jacob. “Just as the stories of old Earth relate, the Great Plains, a huge space like no other. One wonders if the grasslands of the Old World ever hosted such a sight in the time before the written word. The Sahara, the Gobi, the Kalahari, the Atacama, of course, the plains of Argentina and others. Quite possibly, I say. Each with their own species living as lords of all they surveyed.”
“You know a lot about it,” I say.
“I am something of a student of Earth that was. The parallels with the Rock here are amazing. It was terraformed in Earth’s image. Of course Earth was what the original terraform designers and builders knew, so that follows. Nostalgia on their part, one could say, repeated throughout the Galaxies.”
On the other side of me as we ride along, Wolf is saying, “Our quest was to find new worlds and live Injin, not white way. Injin be free like before Columbus time. Injin be own boss, hunt buffalo. Have horse, so maybe after Columbus time, but before rest of white man come. Injin, horse, buffalo. Paradise. Good life, Wolf like to relive. Try agin. Make right, all rich, full of food, happy, no cavalry! Injin Paradise.”
We top out on a hill overlooking a beautiful slow movin’ river and stop for our horses to blow.
“And here it is,” says Wolf sweeping his arm across the horizon.
“Holy shit, look there,” whispers Michael.
Just a ways downstream a herd of buffalo is fording. We watch in awesome wonder as they wade and swim en masse. Many float a good ways downstream before reaching the other side.
“Must be a thousand of them shaggy motherfuckers,” says Spud.
“’Tis a sight for this Injins old achin’ bones,” says Wolf.
“Yeah, what are you compadre, all of 24?” I ask.
“My ancestors’ bones then. Hey ya hey ya hey,” continues Wolf. “They say if you sit by the river long enough you will see the body of your enemy float by.” He looks meaningfully at the white folk around him. Us.
“Those words, my heathen friend, are attributed to Sun Tzu,” says Sir Jacob.
“Yeah, no doubt that old fucker stole it from a’ Injin,” says Wolf.
We all laugh, and shake our reins. The horses move out. We’ve miles to cover before we sleep.
“Which quadrant of our vast Cosmos do you hail from, Annie?” asks Sir Jacob.
“Triassic, born and raised.”
“Dinoland?” asks Lone Wolf.
“One of the dinosaur planets.”
“There’s more than one?” asks Wolf.
“Oh yeah,” I say. “Once old what’s-his-name figured out how to regenerate them, he and his followers filled a whole solar system. Each planet has a different time shot of the Dino Eras. They colonize them then study how they evolve.
“They started with a team of experts to study their creations, then they figured out it would be cheaper to bring agricultural people in to supply them rather than sending ships of food and supplies. Along with everything else, they wanted regular meals. So they opened up the land to homesteading, enticed farmers, ranchers, and the like.
“My people settled there, ranchers, done good for a long time.”
“So you learned to cowboy herding dinosaurs?” asks Sir Jacob.
“No, the scientists thought ahead, they put the agricultural types on a different continent from the dinos. Like most of the planets, it had lots of oceans between the land masses. The dinosaurs were established on Alpha, we were on a big Island called Omega. Long swim, a thousand miles maybe from Alpha.
“Anyhow, it worked out real well. Hell, I was a fifth generation Rockefeller. I grew up cowboyin’, birthin’, brandin’, chousin’ predators, fixin’ fence. The whole ball of wax. Hell, over the five generations my family had built up a hell of a nice place. Big house, big barns, fenced pastures, we had a ton of open range, miles. We looked out the window, everything we could see belonged to us. We done good.
“But we finally had to leave.”
“The dinosaurs acquired long distance swimming skills?” ventures Sir Jacob.
“Nope.” I pause to give ‘em time to figure it out.
“Well?”
“Learned to fly.
“Suddenly instead of coyotes, bears, and wolves, it was velociraptors and their 20 ton cousins. Big chickens, we called ‘em. Once they found out how easy cows was to catch, though, and what beef tasted like, they wasn’t chicken no more.”
“Yeah, I been there, like going on a wild goose chase. Only place in the galaxies where the geese chase you and they ain’t geese, they’re much bigger and mighty hungry,” adds Spud.
“They purely love beef.
“Them suckers swoop down, they don’t even have to land,” I continue. “Pick you right up in their talons and wing away. Calves, too. Foals. Hell, full grown animals even. We tried everything, throw nets, guns, booby traps, even had a Gatling gun going, fun to play with, but the suckers bred like rabbits. It was war. We lost a few folks, too, after they discovered long pig. Rough times.”
“Gave ‘em hell, eh?” asks Spud.
“We tried and tried but we lost. We had to quit while we still had the money to get off the planet. They literally ate us out of business.”
“You divested yourselves of your properties?” asks Sir Jacob.
 “No buyers, ain’t no one that stupid. We ain’t the kind to lie about the situation.”
“Now that,” says Sir Jacob, “is a classic example of Chaos Theory. Chaos Theory deals with the unpredictability of complex situations.”
“Yep, clone up a bunch of giant extinct creatures, turn ‘em loose. Yeehaw!” I say. “Happened on Cretaceous too, the tourist planet. One day the dinosaurs got their fill of gawking humans and attacked.
“And Mesozoic, often a whole group of pioneers will disappear, not one will be heard from again. Ships go in to deliver supplies, nobody home on a whole planet.
“Occasionally, a ragged group of survivors will emerge scared shitless. Hop on the ship, never to return.
“Time passes, people forget or just think they are tougher than the previous bunch and it’s deja vu all over again.
“I figure eventually the dinosaurs will grow thumbs and send out their own trade delegation.”
Michael laughs and says, “If dinosaurs wore t-shirts they would say: ‘Send more pioneers, the last ones were delicious’.”
“So what did you do?” asks Spud.
“Hopped on a ship while I still had money for a ticket. Traveled to a few places, worked a lot of jobs. Finally got a job workin’ cattle in the Center. On a 1000 acre place! Got sick of being crushed by humanity real quick. Only good thing that happened there? Ran into Michael. He started out in Dino country too. Couple of cowhands, lost our way. We struck up a friendship right quick.
“Feller passin’ through told us about the Rock. Said there was space to think out here and work for experienced hands. So we worked there another season, saved up space fare and beat cleats out here.
“Mighty fine planet y’all got here.”
Michael joins in, “You know, the comic book guys have their own galaxy, too. I visited a planet there once. Those folks need scads of planets for all their imaginating. One advantage, nerds don’t hunt and kill each other. At least I don’t think they do.”
We laugh.




22  Next


“What are we going to do next, Wolf?” asks Spud.
“We are going to bring what is hidden into the light.”
“If the weather holds we can get over the pass up there. There is an interesting area on the other side. Hot earth, hot water,” says Sir Jacob.
“Spud has a hot spring,” I say.
“Hm, him take you swimming, just like other girls.”
“Quiet, Wolf,” hisses Spud. “I was keepin’ that on the down low.”
“Annie not stupid, brother,” says Wolf, then continues, “Same hot water here, but more. Water also shoot into sky. Spook horses.”
We are riding along a peaceful valley with a babbling creek. It has been a long morning. We are on a wagon road, so Wolf and I are riding side by side.
“Our journey is long, but we must protect the Spirit Cave.”
“Should we stop and stretch our legs or are we almost there?”
Wolf turns and stares at me as our horses continue to perambulate down the road. Seconds pass, we are rocking easily in our saddles, the horses heads are bobbing in time. I can smell the green shoots of the last Injin summer grass. Wolf keeps staring.
I raise my eyebrows, “What?”
“Wolf not know.”
“You don’t know what?”
“Wolf not know where it is.”
“What? The Spirit Cave?”
“Yes.”
“You are the Guardian, how could you not know?”
“No one know.”
“What?!”
“I go to powwow of the Chiefs.”
“And?”
“No one come. I wait many days.
“Little Owl finally show up say chiefs all dead, one alive, but brain has left body. Other die, heart quit. Last one, ship crash, dead. One missing no one know where. I come here to search, not sure, but think this the place.”
“No one knows where the Spirit Cave is?”
“I think, on this planet.”
“You think? You don’t even know which planet?”
“May be misdirection,” offers Wolf. “Plan meeting here, if chiefs know of bad men maybe have meeting here only, cave elsewhere.”
“You think chiefs would do that?”
“Wise men, very wise, counsel tribe, guide us in tough universe.”
“So now you need new leaders.”
“No, not lead, guide, provide counsel. All Injin truly free, no leaders. Each Injin his own leader. No one else. It is the Way.”
“You never collaborate, always alone?”
“We form team, alliance, only when all agree. If not agree, no team. True freedom.”
“Ah. And the cave?”
“I am Guardian, train from small child years.”
“But the Council?”
“They expect me to apprentice and eventually join Council, them not expect to die young. Booze, too much food, accident. Wolf not ready, too young, not think. Sent to this planet as child because it here? Wolf not know. Injin inscrutable even sometimes to other Injin.
“I think it is here. I follow you, I follow shooters, maybe someone know where is Spirit Cave. Maybe I see a sign. I know signs to find cave. I find, maybe take long time. I am young, long time okay, but if someone else find first? Very bad. Not good. Injin power rest in Spirit Cave. Very bad if others find.”
“This is the journey you have asked us to join. To find the cave?” I ask.
“Hm.”
“But why us? Why not get your kinsmen or others of your tribe?”
“Like I say at Spud’s, me ask, they have white mans’ excuses. ‘I gotta work. I’ll lose my job. I got bills to pay.’ They have lost the Way. They are not Injin now. Our tribe, our heritage is in danger. I am but one man.
“I think these men at the line shack have evil intent. Maybe they are crazy for gold, but maybe they think there is Injin treasure.”
“Is there Injin treasure?” I ask.
“For Injin, yes, treasure beyond counting, but is it valuable like gold to White Eyes? Wolf not know. I think only sacred things, spiritual things, not treasure. Maybe just strings of beads from white man.” Wolf chuckles. “But elders never say. I always think there is time to learn of these things. Knowledge was to be mine when I had acquired the wisdom to take the responsibility. Time stopped for Wolf when these men left from their bodies.
“Wolf responsibility now to regain Injin Spirit, it reside in cave.”
“Oh boy, maybe we bit off more than we can chew.”
“Faith, Annie, we have to trust that the Spirits will guide us.”
“Man, Wolf, when you speak of this, you sure sound Injin.”
“Mmm.”
“You fellas seem to be takin’ this in stride.” I glance over my shoulder. Spud, Michael and Sir Jacob have fallen back a ways. None of them has heard.
“You gonna tell the boys?”
“Hm.”
I ride along and ponder this for a while. Was it a yes or a no?
Then Wolf says “Our last Chiefs Counsel meeting before was on the planet of the twin suns.”
“Hawaiia,” I say in awe. The planets of the twin suns. I have helped deliver cattle to some planets, including the twin planets of Makai and Mauka. Names based on the Hawaiian words for nearer and farther from the ocean. Spirit words.
Makai being closer to the suns is a tropical paradise, lush, warm, fabulous. Mauka is more temperate with desert grassland type flora and fauna, better for some breeds of cattle production as it has less bugs and disease due to having hard freezes in the cool season. Makai though, with longer growing seasons, has more total grass production. Both, fantastically beautiful.
While humanity has advanced to the point of being able to terraform and make planets habitable, the size and distance of the relative astronomical object along with its orbital path around its sun is still the ruling factor of a world’s climate. The size of its sun, major. Hawaiiia’s suns have the same names as their respective planets. It’s a Hawaiian thing, I reckon.
“Yes. Makai, tropical, but we are high on top of the mountain of snow, a spiritual place on a spiritual planet. It is dusk. Makai Sun has settled below the horizon and Mauka Sun is just about to join it. We are watching for the green flash of Mauka Sun before we start. It is an important sign.
“Afterwards we go into the Spirit Teepee which has been painted and blessed for the ceremony, the fire is perfect. Built and tended by Coati.
“Moxie has the pipe. He speaks of many adventures. He is a talker. He passes the pipe to Many Horses, who speaks also. Then it is the turn of Great Sorrow who lost his wife to the plague. The elders nod and hum. Ancient Owl tells of what he has seen. Pieces are added to stories, variations of what happened are discussed. Disagreements are laughed away. The chiefs are wise enough to know that each mans’ journey is different. Even at the same place and time, each man has a different experience even standing next to each other, so how can it all be real? And so it goes around the circle. The chiefs speak of many things. Often they speak in allegory. I am very young, a novice. If I start to slumber Moxie nudges me with an elbow. Stories are long and full of meanderings. I listen, but many things mean little to me.
“As I tell you this, I remember the stories of Many Horses catch my attention. He is a good and entertaining talker. There is much laughter in his words. We laugh at his antics until we roll on the floor. Even the Elder Chiefs, the men of great dignity are reduced to laughter, so much that the tears flow down their faces. Moxie nudges me during one story and says, ‘Listen well, Dancing Colt. Remember.’
“I try hard to listen, but I am very tired from days around the fire listening, the teepee is warm inside despite the blizzard without. My belly is full of buffalo hump and I am so tired.
“Today, as I look back, I am thinking that maybe the location of the cave is in these stories. A clue. I must meditate on this, herbs must be taken. A smoke ceremony. Heat, thirst, drink, walk, ice, fire, an answer must arise from within. If I listen closely I can hear the spirits of my teachers and their teachers. I have traveled many journeys on this planet, seen many things. All my life until now must lead into a journey to place of the Spirit Cave. I know this, in my bones I know this.
“I must have trusted companions for this, this Buffalo Odyssey. You are my compañeros espiritual.”




23  Meanwhile Back at Camp

After a quick saddle bag lunch of hard tack, cold biscuits, and agua, we have a little powwow. Then Wolf and Sir Jacob take off fast to scout the line shack.
 “Get a feel for what we are up against,” says Wolf, spiritual sucker.
As dark approaches we come down into a beautiful meandering stream with big cottonwood tree coverage in the bosque. Rocks, flowers, trees, trout in the shallows, all that good shit.
“Just another fucking dinosaur free day in paradise,” I say.
Spud laughs and Michael and I count our blessings. We both had had way too many close scrapes before we escaped the dino worlds.
We ride in to see Wolf and Sir Jacob lolling in the grass at stream side. As we walk over a dog stands up and growls.
“Your dog bite, Wolf?” Michael asks.
“Bitch not mine, hers,” says Mr. Laconic.
“Annie’s? I know that ain’t true,” says Michael.
“Naw, bitch belong herself, free like Injin, not runnin’ dog of government like white man,” says Wolf. “You white folk move slow, British Lord and Wolf been here hours. We got four fish, need more.”
We get down just as it starts to drizzle. We pull on our ponchos and unsaddle, then loose the horses to graze. We throw our hand lines in the water. Soon we’ll have plenty fish fer dinner. Maybe.
The bitch watches us all from under a dry tree.
“We are near enough, time to make camp,” says Wolf. “Across creek in edge of trees, nice cove, good firewood.”
“I see it over there,” says Spud. “Water and good shelter from the wind. Fire camp, be frost by morning.”
“Singin’ to the choir Spud. Annie and I been campin’ fer a month, winter’s movin’ in,” says Michael. “We been forced to cuddle to save wood.”
Spud cocks an eye at me. “Y’all sure he’s gay?”
“Damn sure. Not for my lack of tryin’ though,” I say. “He won’t even switch hit.”
“I am pure in my heart,” says Michael.
“Cain’t argey that,” I agree.
We all split up for separate chores. Collecting firewood for heat and soft pine boughs to cushion our soogans, and balance rocks for the cook pot. Wolf unpacks the food and pots from the camp pack horses.
Michael and I drag in limbs and brush and build a quick fire heated lean-to. Sir Jacob looks up from thatching the roof, watches for a bit then asks, “What’s better, brush lean-to, teepee or a wall tent?”
“It’s an age old controversy,” says Michael, “but I feel they each have their place.”
“Then there is the Whelan lean-to, champion of the fire camp,” says Spud, as he pulls a long bag out of the panniers.
“The main consideration in the wet is the fire. Since we had to pack it all in here on horses, a fire with a lean-to on each side is the perfect dry out and warm back up solution,” agrees Michael.
“Yep, snug in our bedrolls.”
Every piece of dead wood in the country is wet from the last few hours of rain and drizzle, so Sir Jacob and Spud fan out in search of sheltered spots where they might find some dry sticks to get a quick cook blaze started. Michael wanders off and returns up in an armload of pitch wood.
“Nothin’ but the finest fer my brave compañeros,” says Michael.
Michael stacks the wisps and kindling. I take the damp twigs and whittle into them to get to the dry interior, slivering the edges to make more kindling. A dry sliver stick can make yore day in this weather. The pitch wood don’t take too much help to light.
Soon we are settin’ in our lean-tos, food on the fire. Wolf is feelin’ in his war bag for fixins’.
Spud pours the coffee and we all commence drying our backsides.
Wolf stuffs his pipe, which is a marvel of carvin’ and decoratin’, and lights up our evening med’cine.
“Don’t forget to share,” says Sir Jacob.
Wolf smiles and passes the pipe around.
“Finest kind,” says Spud passing it on to me. “Wolf always has the best weed.”
“Injin Spirit blend, make us happy, not sleepy. Long ride and first class meal make us sleepy. Annie Talks To Horses say Michael first class chef.”
“Ah,” I say. “Yes. It is so.”
“Nice tender pup meat on the hoof right there,” Michael says and points at the stray. “Dog tacos, hombres?”
“’Nother month or two be more meat, still tender,” says Wolf and winks.
“Hell, she won’t stick around. Wild already, look at her eyes, Michael,” I say.
“We must address him as Don Miguel tonight as he cooks from the recipes of his Mexican heritage,” says Sir Jacob.
“Sir Jakey spotted them tortillers,” says Spud.
A bit later Michael says, “Grits on.”
“Say what?” asks Spud.
Michael laughs and says, “Grits for the gritters.”
“Come on Wolf,” I say. “Grit down.”
“Mmm, good vittles,” says Wolf. “Grit down, I like it. Maybe I learn Mexican, too.”
As we eat, I look up and see an extra set of eyes across the fire. The bitch has joined us. She is sitting quietly. After we finish, I gather the leftovers and head over to share. The bitch backs off, so I set them near where she had been sitting and retreat. She takes her time, but eventually hunger overcomes her reticence and she sniffs in slowly, eyeing us. We sit still, talking and appearing to ignore her, while watching her out the corners of our eyes.
Spud looks at Wolf and asks, “What did y’all find at the line shack?”
“Wolf take big circle, Sir Jacob him go close.”
Sir Jacob says, “I settled in on that ridge top behind the cabin. What I saw, I cannot explain, maybe drugs?
“There were two men runnin’ through the woods. They were starkers. It was like they were children playing tag. One was chasing the other, skipping and laughing.”
A light bulb comes on over Sir Jacob’s head. “Oh, of course, they were frolicking. Oh my.
“I’ve been in the company of rough tough cowboys for too long. One forgets.”
“Good thing Michael didn’t hear that, he’d skin ya.” I laugh. Michael is off gathering more wood.
“Of course, how thoughtless of me. My sincere apologies all round. One thinks of ruffians as being rough.”
“Just joking, Sir Jacob. Michael has a planet class sense of humor, even toward his own self.”
“Starkers, what the hell is a Starker?” asks Spud.
We all laugh at that.
“Oh, Spud, not to worry,” says Sir Jacob. “They were naked!”
“Naked Starkers?”
“Yes, no, yes, naked means starkers.”
“Oh.”
After a fine meal and another pipe we open our tarps and crawl into our bedrolls, with a nice bed of coals and a few big logs at hand to keep us warm ‘til morning.
A last word of wisdom comes from Sir Jacob. “Stories are the 20th century myth, passed down to us. They are still the campfires we gather around to pass along legends. Only a very fortunate few of us still create and share the real experience. I thank you, my boon companions, for sharing this with my humble self.”
“Humble, Jakey? You crack me up, pard,” says Spud.
We fall off to sleep smiling, the stars twinkling above. The hours pass in comfortable beauty filled dreams.
Outside the lean-to the rising sun is melting the frost. The shadows are still white, sparkling with the tiny crystals. A beautiful sight. The brook is babbling, could life get much better?
We stir up the coals, scramble up some eggs and warm last night’s biscuits with our coffee.
Sir Jacob sips his joe, admiring the sunrise. “For centuries we have been searching for a unifying theory of everything, a zero point energy field containing all knowledge and experience from the beginning of time.”
“Oh, come on, you aren’t physicists,” I say.
“Better yet, we’re cowboys,” says Spud.
“You know anything about that chaos theory they talk about?” I ask.
“It has to do with there being order, and even great beauty in what looks like total chaos. And if we look closely enough at the randomness around us, patterns will start to emerge.”
“In that case, explain weather,” says Spud.
We laugh.
As I walk across the clearing to catch up Spike, I notice that our makeshift horse corral is empty, gate open.
“Someone has stole the whole remuda. Damn it,” I say, “looks like civilization has done caught up with us. Cain’t be helped. What’s done is done.”
Wolf looks around and says, “No, what’s done is never done. And it maybe never happened.”
Sir Jacob offers, “What we see, what we hear. All that our senses present to us is fabrication, no more real than a dream. We can only know that which we believe. That which we believe, that is all we have.”
Spud says, “Jake’s right, Wolf too, in this case of deception. I went out before dark, turned ‘em out. You just didn’t see me. They’re trained camp horses, won’t stray far.”
Wolf points and says, “See here? Only boot tracks by the gate latch are Spuds.”
Everyone laughs.
Red faced, I whistle and after a bit Spike and Boots come trotting in alone. Michael and I saddle up and climb on board.
“Guess you fellas are walkin’.”
About then the rest of the remuda comes sauntering around the corner looking for a handful of grain. The rest of the boys saddle up while Michael and I dismount to load the pack string. The bitch is still around, but keeps her distance.
“I do believe that bitch is a cattle guardian dog from the look of her. She might tame down and work, she is just a big pup,” says Michael. “We could damn sure use a good dog fer runnin’ predators off the calves.”
“You bet,” say I.



24  Line Shack


After a few miles of riding with the bitch not far behind us, we climb a hill. Spud raises an arm and we all dismount and crawl up to the ridge top.
“This is not really a very clever hideout. It is, after all, our line shack,” says Sir Jacob.
“But them dudes don’t know it, they likely think it is someone’s small abandoned home,” counters Wolf.
“In a situation where bullets are flying it is important to have a general plan and a General to coordinate it all. So we are working together, not at odds,” says Sir Jacob. “In these situations Spud is our leader, being the most locally experienced and having, I believe, untapped leadership qualities. He will come up with the plan.”
I look at Spud. Spud looks confused
“That’s good, right?” asks Michael.
“Possible you weren’t around for some of his previous plans,” mutters Wolf.
Meanwhile Spud and I are deep in discussion.
“We’ve talked this through, I even took a course,” I say.
“Talkin ain’t doin’. Talkin’ ain’t learnin’ either. Doin’ and doin’ agin, over and over agin is learnin’. We call it experience,” remarks Spud.
“Book learnin’ is useful,” I insist.
“Sure it is, so is talkin’, but look at the FNG, fucking new guy, death rate in any war. Them fellers, just arrived from school, no field experience, die like flies,” warns Spud. “They ain’t no substitute for experience.”
“Yore own book learnin’ is bound to have helped, too. It ain’t all experience.”
“Hells bells girl, if I had wanted book learnin’ I’d of gone to school.”
“What?”
“Close yore mouth, girl. Yore catchin’ flies.”
Wolf says, “Spud and I did not go to school. Much of our not going to school was done together. I feel that has left us not smart, but smart ass.”
“Actually we was home schooled. Hooky was our favorite class.”
Sir Jacob says, “I have in fact observed, through long association, enough to know that under my ass is a horse much cleverer than either of you.”
“Hell, horses are smarter than all of us,” I say.
“Which explains why she talks to them,” says Wolf.
“That loosened us up,” says Spud.
Sir Jacob adds, “The much maligned school of hard knocks is, I believe, the best school of all. It hopefully includes a visit or two to the library or better yet the oracles themselves. There is much wisdom to be had from some of even the most common of men.”
Spud looks at me and says, “Trust me, you need to hang back or stay out of it. Okay?”
“I can provide cover fire,” I say.
“Okay, but be careful.”
“She is a crack shot,” says Michael.
“Long as she don’t get her personal head shot off,” says Spud. “Okay, Annie Oakley, you stay up here, use the sniper rifle. Don’t shoot me.”
“Or Injin,” adds Wolf.
“This is crazy! We can’t just shoot people like the old time cowboys did,” says Michael.
“Must I remind you? This is still the Rock and we are old time cowboys,” says Sir Jacob.
“No black and white. All shades of gray,” adds Spud.
Michael and I chew on that a bit. The others wait patiently.
His Dukeness peers all around, surveying the layout. Then he walks over to the ammo mule, pulls out a full bandoleer and lifts it over his head.
“The element of surprise is a formidable advantage in combat,” says Sir Jacob as he loads his revolver, then reaches for a rifle. He has another rifle slung over his shoulder and few grenades at ready to stuff in his vest.
Wolf looks at Sir Jacob. “How many weapons you plan to take? Ya got but two hands.”
Sir Jacob says, “A lot of choices present themselves. I plan to be prepared for all.”
“There’s a lot of fine ways to die,” says Spud, “and I ain’t waitin’ for the Centrists to choose mine.” He cocks his gun.
“First rule of Injin warfare, do not let them know where you are,” says Wolf. “I will circle round.”
“I thought Spud was in charge,” I say.
“Wolf read Spud mind.”
“We been workin’ together fer a long time,” Spud agrees.
“What we need is a robust backup plan,” says I.
“We’ll just sneak up,” says Spud.
Suddenly, Michael rushes out of the bushes below us screaming, “I’m here, I’m here, they’re coming to get me. Help!”
“Or create a diversion, an alternate school of thought,” says Spud and then he scuttles off.
Michael goes up and pounds on the door, still yelling.
Eventually he turns the knob, walks in.
We wait.
In a few minutes he comes back out.
“Shit, the door closing, all the rattling I heard?” he yells up.
“One guy, he just died. He was still jerking around, leftover muscle spasms. Dead as a doornail now.”
“Objects are not deceptive, they are deception,” says Sir Jacob.
Wolf stands up on the other side of the shack, shrugs his shoulders.
Spud rises from behind his bush. “Fuck! Okay, let’s search for a clue, anything.”
Wolf disappears.
“Annie and Jake, stay here and keep an eye peeled, this could be a diversion to out divert our diversion. Be sure yore both watching different directions at all times. And don’t lose them damn horses.” Spud walks down the hill kicking innocent rocks. “Damn it!”
“Is he grouchy?”
“So it would appear. Big adrenaline buildup, only natural, he expected answers,” says Sir Jacob.
“Hell, me too.”
Spud joins Michael in searching inside the cabin. Wolf stays outside casting around looking for sign. The bitch is about 50 feet from Sir Jacob and I, alert and watching both the cabin and the perimeter. Just like us but with better nose and ears.
After a bit, out of the corner of my eye I see the bitch swivel her head. I look over my shoulder to where she’s looking.
“Hey ya,” says Wolf quietly.
I jump, Wolf has sneaked up agin. “Damn Injin.”
Wolf says, “Bitch see me, protect you. Good Spirit Dog.”
“And wipe that shit eatin’ grin off yore face.”
Wolf grins. “Wolf bring dead man mare, nice quiet ride, make good foals.”
“Good foals?”
“Part of Wolf horse herd now.”
“Thievin’ Injins, give us all a bad name.”
Wolf laughs. “Rock rules. Besides, him no have next of kin, me check.”
“Okay. You look in the root cellar?” I ask.
“Cellar?”
“Over in the trees north of the shack.”
“Not know about that.”
“I ‘bout lost a bull in there during round up. Some rock pilings from an old house, likely burned down, fallen down chimney, not much else. Root cellar ‘bout 30 yards north. Right in them thick dog hair trees. Didn’t look in the cellar, bull ran off again so I got too. Figured you knew of it. Probably should check it out. Just in case it ain’t fell in.”
“I go tell Spud and Mike. You move north on ridge, cover us.”
Sir Jacob and I move back from the rim. I gather the horses, tying the ones who’ll pony to their buddies so I have less of a handful of reins and heads.
“Easy, Boots, Spike. Let’s go boys.” We quietly make our way north, Sir Jacob keeping a good lookout. I tie a couple of the horses; hobble and ground tie the rest and meet Jacob on the rim. The bitch sets up just a bit south of us. She seems to be as careful as we are about being quiet and laying low.
“Could it be this is not her first battle with humans?” wonders Sir Jacob. “She is certainly careful.”
“Woods are full of wolves and Mexicans,” pointing at himself, “that love puppy meat,” says Michael.
Wolf laughs and says, “Best keep eye on Michael.”
“True, the boy loves his tacos,” I say.
Spud meets us at our new overlook.
“Point it out to me. Don’t want ‘em to hear us thrashing around down there lookin’ fer it. Can’t let ‘em know we’re coming until we are all set up.”
“Look down there where that dead snag, looks lightning struck is, see it?”
“Okay.”
“That’s where the fallen chimney is, it don’t stick up into sight from here. But over here just below us where the hillside meets the flat if you look off to the left maybe 40 feet, you can just see a stovepipe, real rusty, sticking up out of that brush patch.”
“Aha. Okay.”
Just then we spot Wolf who holds up three fingers and makes the horse sign. Then two fingers and makes the human sign.
“Is Michael going to do the chicken run agin?” I ask.
“No, I told him to calm down this time or I would shoot him,” says Spud.
“But he looked so cute.”
Spud says, “Michael didn’t find evidence of any other visitors here. Maybe these guys shot the guy at the line shack, hard to say.”
“Did he figure anything out about who kilt the guy at the line shack? Any last words or such?” I ask.
“Nope.” Spud gets up. “We’ll wake those naked starker cocksuckers right up,” he whispers and heads down the hill.
I set the sniper scope right in front of where I think the door of the root cellar should be in the brush. When Spud arrives at the bottom he tiptoes over and I can see him drop a grenade down the stovepipe.
“Holy shit, I thought we wanted them alive. And any evidence!” I exclaim quietly.
“Not to worry,” whispers Sir Jacob.
After a few seconds, smoke comes pouring out along with shadowy coughing figures.
“Drop your weapons now!” yells Spud.
“We just want to talk,” says Michael.
They drop and roll and start shooting wildly, not seeing us. One spots Spud and draws a bead.
I aim for a shoulder and pull the trigger, but with him rolling it hits center and the guy stops moving.
Sir Jacob lobs a grenade down into the woods, hoping to distract the second guy. But the guy must be a soldier, he ignores it, draws down on Spud, then falls. The sound of Wolf’s shot follows.
Michael walks out carefully, using trees for cover. We can’t be sure that no one is left in the root cellar. Wolf covers him, as do we.
Spud goes over to the stovepipe and yells down, “Come out on five or I drop a real grenade.”
Of course, we want to look at what’s in the cellar, it’s an empty threat.
After Spud gets to two, Michael rushes in the door, guns in both hands. All is quiet though. Michael comes out after a minute, coughing. After a breath he says. “Seems to be all clear, I disarmed the trip wire, just smoke left. Couldn’t stay down there yet, we need to wait for the smoke to dissipate.”
Spud is checking the wounded, one is moving. He yells, “Jakey, bring yore bag!”
I stay up top in case any other baddies are nearby. Sir Jacob runs down and works on the wounded.
Meanwhile Michael and Spud go toward the root cellar.
Bitch gives me warning agin, flicking an ear. Wolf shows up by me. “Good dog, never make sound. You go down, help. Wolf watch.”
As I go down the hill, Sir Jacob yells. I hear two shots. I stop and look. Sir Jacob is looking at the wounded guy, who is doing the death shake. Sir Jacob’s head is bloody.
I run down to help.
Jacob is standing looking down at his patient. “It’s unseemly shooting persons of substance. Not to mention the very doctor trying to save your life, you bastard.”
Sir Jacob has a tiny derringer in his right hand. The bad guy has a hole in the center of his forehead.
Sir Jacob looks at me and says, “There was concern that I was bringing too many armaments, ha!” Then he passes out. Spud and Michael have arrived by this time.
“It’s just a scratch,” says Michael,
Michael pulls out a bandana. “Compression, Annie.”
“Wake up you Brit bastard,” says a distraught Spud.
“Is he okay?” yells Wolf.
“Head wound, lotsa blood, but only the scalp, not bone. Probably not a problem, depends,” Michael yells back.
“Depends?”
“Bigger caliber, more of a shock wave. Concussion is my concern here.” Michael opens Sir Jacob’s eyes one at a time, looking for trouble. “They seem to be dilated equally, a prayer couldn’t hurt here, anyone got religion?”
“Damn, lotta blood,” says Spud. “Hit a bleeder. Wolf’s up there right now keepin’ lookout and prayin’ with his eyes open. Prayin’ to his heathen Injin gods. Best gods of all. If prayer works, Sir Jacob be just fine.”
I pray too. I believe we all are prayin’, havin’ high regard for our royal friend.
Sure ‘nough, in a bit, our prayers are answered. Sir Jacob moans, rolls his head around. He puts his hands up to his forehead and opens his eyes.
He looks at Michael, who is aiming his knife towards Jake’s head, and says, “Ye gods man, lets, uh, not cut off anything important there.”
“Just a shave and a haircut pard, not to worry.”
Sir Jacob laughs painfully and says, “Good lord. I must indeed remain amongst the living, I am surrounded by my beloved heathen friends.”
“I prayed hard for you, Sir Jake,” I say, “but I’m not religious, so there’s the risk that my praying could be taken as an affront which might make matters worse.”
“Faith is but the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen. I verily believe all prayers are seen the same. Thank you, my dear Annie. You seem also to have saved my veritable bacon by shooting the other bloke.”
Sir Jacob sits up, sways, then rests a bit. We all watch and worry. “Relax children,” he says. “My head is much too hard to be bothered by a mosquito bite like this.”
Michael draws Spud over toward the root cellar, stopping a ways away to confab. Then Spud covers Michael while he heads toward the entrance. In a minute Michael sticks his head out and calls, “All clear. Wolf, you should come look at this.”
Then Spud walks back to us. “Thought we had a situation but it looks to be taken care of. Booby trap. Michael disarmed it his first trip in. Stone cold, that guy.”
“Yeah, seen it before,” I say. “Blurs his swish image of hisself, so we don’t talk about it when he’s in the room.”
I run up the hill to spell Wolf.
Spud and Wolf go in the cellar. Michael comes out to keep an eye on Sir Jacob. After an exam of Sir Jake’s wound, the two wilderness docs head out to search the area around the hideout.
Eventually, just before I die of starvation, they show up at the bitch and my’s outpost.
“Looks like we got them all. One man per horse and a pack animal. Saddles tell the tale. And not enough sign for another,” says Michael.
“So that Soames, the Federal, one of the dead?” I ask.
“Nope, no sign of him,” says Michael. “I think we are okay now. We got the bitch to guard for us, we’ll see how she does, and of course the horses always are a help. Come on down, we’ll rustle up some vittles.”
We gather up the ever patient horses and head down the hill. I unsaddle and turn them loose to forage while the boys gather wood.
I look around at the carnage. “Lotta dead bodies.”
Michael says, “Personally I deplore violence, but that was totally worth the loss of karma points.”
“Let’s go fix us a meal.”
Then I go over and hallo the root cellar. Spud sticks a head out. I ask him, “We’re lookin’ to fix a meal. Shall we fire up out here?”
“Yeah, close in here, lot of junk. Still smells of that smoke bomb, too.”
After the fire is going and food is cooking, Sir Jacob heads up the hill. On his return, he says, “That bitch is still up there watching. Bloody good lookout she is.”
When grits are on, we call the searchers out.
They emerge grimy, but smiling.
We fill our plates and set. After eating our fill, we coffee up.
“The suspense is killing me,” I say. “I got a feelin’ you found something.”
Wolf nods and intones, “We have found something that will change everything.”





25  Evidence


“That bitch gonna be a good enough guard if we all go inside?” wonders Michael.
“Maybe,” I say, “maybe not. I can go up.”
“Naw, you should go in and see, if Wolf lets you. I’ll go help the bitch, we ain’t known her long, and four eyes are better than two,” Michael volunteers. “I seen some of the stuff, anyhow you can fill me in later. Fijate, this vaquero can guard your gringo scalps.” Michael heads up to join the bitch on watch.
Wolf takes the rest of us down into the root cellar. There are two small dirt floored rooms, with shelves for canned goods and bins for veggies. It smells of smoke grenades, dirt and mold. Wolf leads Sir Jacob into the second room where I can see a large table under a kerosene lamp. They are looking at something on the table. In a bit, they confer in low voices, then I hear Sir Jacob say, “Empirical evidence suggests, but it is difficult to say, maybe...”
While I intellectually respect their right to privacy, curiosity overcomes reason so I strain my ears to eavesdrop.
Spud says, “We can likely all crawl in there and look as soon as Wolf or Sir Jacob gives us the say so. It ain’t a secret, well, maybe it is. Hell, I don’t know. I just found out myself. Damned if I know what to think.”
Wolf looks up and motions us in with his chin. “Wolf need Sir Jacob’s intuitive reaction first. Come, my brothers, look. You too girl.” He smiles.
We all crowd in around the table.
Wolf raises a hand and says, “Many delicate papers here, better use careful touch.”
“Burnt, half burnt. The smoke grenade?”
“No, it only emits smoke, no fire,” says Sir Jacob.
Amongst the papers I see snatches of things I recognize. I run my eyes slowly around the table, seeing patches and pieces of words and names, some sentences.
“What is all this?”
“Look here, John Wayne, treasure?”
“What the fuck?”
“Is this the Hollywood history?”
“Or just more clues.”
“...bits and pieces of...”
Spud is over looking at things on some oak shelves against the walls. He says, “Look. Over here.” He picks up a stack of papers and carries them over to a bare spot on the table.
We see scraps of sentences on the papers. Many are damaged by fire and time. They talk of: Seven cities of Tzibola, artifacts found in Spirit Cave cached by the Tzibolan Medicine Men. Moccasin telegraph presaged Estevanicos arrival. Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca, Fray Marcos de Niza, Francisco Vasquez de Coronado.”
“What are these talking about? A Spirit Cave on Old Earth, conquistadores, what does that have to do with here?” asks Wolf.
“There is also a map,” says Spud. He carefully moves a few papers to reveal a detailed map.
“Earth?” I ask.
“No, here. See, we are here,” says Spud.
“And the bloody Spirit Cave, just over here,” says Sir Jacob. He points at a symbol on the map.
“Hells bells! So you suppose someone brought Spirit Cave contents out from Earth?”  I wonder aloud.
Sir Jacob has found a magnifying glass. “Unless the map is a hoax.” 
“Whoa.” 
“It would seem unlikely, but maybe there were escape flights before Earth was destroyed, refugees.”
“Saving their history, their essence,” Wolf says.
“I mean, I was present for the terraforming. Indeed there were ruins of cities. Possible, unlikely but possible.”
“Sounds like hooey to me. Hell, Earth was blown all to hell and gone in the Troubles. They say no one escaped.  As we all know ‘they’ say we can always believe everything ‘they’ tell us,” Spud says and scratches his head. “I’ll be a son of a bitch.”
“A mistake generally made by almost everyone, my dear skeptical Mr. Mullens,” mutters Sir Jacob, “believing what ‘they’ say.”
“Wait, there is another Spirit Cave here. See? Just on the south side of this hill.” I point.
“Two?” We all start examining the map more closely.
 “Dang, here is another, Spud.” I point it out.
“Here also,” says Wolf.
“Red herrings? Or a code?” asks Spud.
“Let us gather all the evidence and anything looking even remotely like it might matter. We go to my teepee, safer,” says Wolf. “No one sneak up to surprise us.”
 “You up to a ride Sir Jacob?” asks Spud.
“If all the difficulties were known at the outset of a long journey, few of us would ever embark,” says Sir Jake. “In other words, indeed I am.”
We start gathering the papers carefully and placing them in the hard sided folders the bandits have conveniently left us. We pack the folders in the panniers, load them on the interlopers pack horse, tarp them over, and throw a diamond hitch to lash it all down.
Suddenly, a pebble hits the ground near me. It’s our signal, I look up at the hill at Michael and he signs that someone is coming. Not friendly. We should go now. We throw saddles on horses without cinching up tight and lead them out of sight into the trees.
Michael comes down the hill and tells us, “It’s Soames, about 10 minutes out.”
“Maybe time for that second date, if you don’t mind?” says Sir Jacob.
I say, “Soames? Gross, is there anyone you won’t sleep with?”
Michael shrugs and  says, “There’s an entire gender I won’t sleep with.”
We are all cinching up as he speaks again. “Basta, you all go. ‘Don Miguel’ will circle back so that Soames and he arrive here together. He will be shocked that the papers are missing and may even care that these guys are dead, if they are his guys. Maybe he will spill the frijoles.”
“Be careful, compadre.”
“Seguro que si. Voy a ver, I will see what I can find out.” Already getting into character, Don Miguel lopes off.
We cinch up tight and skedaddle at a high trot before Soames is in earshot, relieved that the papers are secure in the hard cases.
“Not a moment too soon. You are psychic, Wolf,” I say.
“Unh unh, Injin prescient, not psychic,” explains Wolf.



26  Don Miguel


I head up on top where I have a good view of Michael as he leaves us at the root cellar and circles back to meet up with Jonathan Soames.
He trots out making a long circle so that he comes up on Soames from behind just as they come through the notch below me.
“Hallo, the rider!” Michael shouts, trotting up the trail behind Soames.
Soames stops and looks back.
“It’s Don Miguel, do I not recognize you Señor? Señor Soames is it?”
“Oh, yes,” says Soames. “Señor Don Miguel, approach.”
Michael walks his horse closer. “Good morning Señor, I thought the hat was familiar. How are you this fine afternoon?”
“Good, good. What brings you out this way, Don Miguel?”
“I am looking for my niece, she has, how you say? Ah, pulled the disappearing act once again. Do you have children, Señor Soames?”
“No I do not.”
“They can be a trial, but a wonderful trial, I assure you. In my culture, children are our legacy. We hope they work through the wild years and mature into solid persons,” says Don Miguel. “But the wild years, ay yi yi, they can be difficult.
“I am so sorry to bore you with my trivial life. How is it you are on paseo out here, Señor?”
“I am indeed out for a ride, admiring the country. Paseo, as you say. I have some friends to visit on down the trail.”
“Then we can ride companionably together for a few miles, yes?”
“Certainly, you may find these gentlemen interesting. They too are searching for treasure or souvenirs as are you.”
“Ah, tesoro. The lure of treasure is a great temptation even to the most esteady of men. I look forward to meeting your friends,” says Don Miguel.
I lower my rifle and crawl away from my lookout. Then I mount up and lope off to join the others.
***
Once again we are traveling through Tatonka. Buffalo herds are grazing everywhere and the grass is belly deep on our horses. We trot around the buff, stopping twice to tighten the hitches on the panniers so our precious cargo doesn’t jump off the sawbucks.
“At this pace I believe we’ll make yore place easy afore dark, Wolf,” says Spud.
“Maybe, wanna beat that big storm. Keep papers dry,” says Wolf.
“Yeah, I’ve had my eye on them clouds, too. The tarps over the panniers should do it, but a big wind can get water in the damnedest places,” I say.
“Not to mention that we are the tallest things out on the plains here,” adds Sir Jacob. “Tall gentry are lightning rods.”
“I always figured it was the short folk on the tall horses that drew the zingers,” I say to Wolf. “We’re safe.”
“Why Wolf ride pony,” says Wolf. “Wolf notice Annie Talks To Horses ride pony too. Like our Mongolian fathers.”
“I never trusted a tall horse. Long legs, no sense.” I look around at the boys. “Applies to men folk, too.”
“Hey!” Spud leans over for a smooch.
“Aren’t the Federals gonna miss all these folks we been killin’?” I ask.
“Guess Don Miguel might be on the hot seat right about now, explainin’ that,” says Spud.
“Naw, Soames won’t suspect him, our friend Don Miguel may appear to be a fool, but he is not,” says Wolf.
“How many have we killed anyway?” Spud smiles at me. “Believe I’ve lost count.”
“Blimey, life is complicated. Even the best of motives can have awful consequences, intended or not,” says Sir Jacob.
“I definitely intended to shoot center, assholes were trying to kill us,” I say.
“In this branch of business apparently,” Sir Jacob says, “we don’t fire them, we fire at them.”
“You bet.”




27  Lone’s Camp


We climb once again out of the meadows and wind up into the tree line. By late afternoon we top out in a pass. Below us is an open grassy park with copses of trees around the edges and along the creek. There is fog laying in the bottoms.
Smoke rises from a side draw.
“Here we are.”
“Here we are? Where? I don’t see nothin’ but open range.”
“Wolf’s ‘open’ range, as you say,” says Spud.
Wolf leads us down the trail.
“Hey ya.” A long haired woman in buckskins steps into the trail ahead of Wolf. He hops off, leans down and hugs her then remounts and gives her an arm up behind his saddle.
I look at enquiringly at Sir Jacob who has pulled up beside me. He says, “That, Annie, is Wolf’s mother, Coati Chaser.”
We trot on down the draw. When we get out into the flat we come upon a giant white dog who comes over the check us out. Coati Chaser talks to her, but she looks behind us and growls.
Sir Jacob turns his head back the way the dog is looking and says, “I’ll be bloody damned, the bitch is still with us.”
Spud looks around. “Sure ‘nough, thought she ditched us at the root cellar.”
Sir Jacob agrees, “I haven’t seen her all day either.”
“Annie see her,” says Wolf.
“Yeah, I talked to her when I got off to pee. Guess you boys weren’t gawkin’ after all.”
The white dog goes over. She and the bitch raise their hackles and do the growl and paw routine.
“They work it out,” says Wolf.
I can see the white dog’s partner on the other side of a sheep herd that is just moving into sight.
“Pair runs this bunch all by their selves,” says Wolf.
“Fine lookin’ guardian dogs,” I say as we continue down the trail.
We circle down through the thick trees and turn up the side draw where I spot smoke. Hours of drizzle have wet us down and softened us up, the rising smoke has a magnetic attraction for us.
We come into a ring of three beautifully painted teepees. Camp is all set up with a cooking tripod over the central fire, A-frame drying racks with meat a jerkin’, hides stretched on hoops. There’s a corral for ponies and other stock with a hollow log stock tank. Windmill, solar panels. Wolf pulls up and Coati slides off his horse.
I look over at Wolf’s face, snug under the hood of his intestine rain poncho. “A real beauty of a camp setup, Wolf. Yours?”
“Unh unh.” Wolf shakes his head, flinging water in all directions. “Coati Chaser camp. Wolf have teepee here.”
We get off our horses, Spud and Sir Jacob unpack and rush the panniers inside while Wolf and I unsaddle and loose the bunch. We grab our tack and duck in out of the drizzle.
I am so fucking happy to be in out of the rain which is now starting to pound on the teepee skin. My legs are cramped, I am more than damp, the rain has crept up my arms, my sleeves are soaked to the elbows. My chaps kept most of the weather out, but around the edges a cold wet has crept in from the wind blowing my slicker off of them. I am cold and wet to the skin in enough places to be shivering. Thank the gods I have a warm horse who heated me all the hours of the afternoon. And now, after the outdoor chores, a warm teepee to rest my trail weary bones.
“Starved too, hope there’s vittles,” I mutter.
Wolf ignores my grouchiness and introduces me, “Mother, name Coati Chaser, this is my new friend Annie Talks To Horses.”
Coati Chaser comes over and looks me carefully up and down. I feel like she is about to open my mouth and age me by the wear on my teeth. She just about does, pretty intense scrutiny, then she pronounces, “Annie Talks To Horses make good wife.”
“Hey,” I exclaim.
“Not worry. Wolf think so too,” says Wolf.
“What the hell?” I look to Spud.
“Coati Woman has spoken,” says Spud and goes over and wraps her in a big hug. “Hey, Ma, that girl is mine.”
“What the fuck?” I gasp.
“Close yore mouth Annie, not worry. Spud share with elder brother, you no lose me.”
“Yes, Coati know all,” says Coati. A real shy flower this one.
“Coati raised that pair,” says Sir Jacob, “and a right fair job she made of it. Taught them the importance of sharing.”
Spud and Wolf both grin, stare at the floor and turn red in the face.
“Sheeit!” I groan. They all laugh, even the stern looking Coati. Son of a bitch, maybe it was all a practical joke. Wife? No fucking way. I can barely put up with me myself.
Wolf stirs up the coals and throws a log into the fire ring in the center of the teepee. Coati stirs the stew and moves it to the cooking fire, which is all coals.
Sir Jacob and I arrange the wet saddles and blankets far enough out toward the edge of the teepee to be out of our way but still dry out from the warmth of the fire. Wolf inspects the panniers. “Good. Dry inside.”
“Come,” says Coati. “Sit. Let us relax and wait for food to heat.” She busies herself with pots and things.
Lightning strikes a tree outside, close enough our hair stands on end.
“Glad this tempest didn’t strike earlier when we were out in it,” says Sir Jacob.
“Are you all wet, too?” I ask. “I am the wettest I have been in a few, usually my slicker does the trick. It was that damn wind.”
“It slipped in between my hat and collar and ran down my neck there at the end, sure glad the teepee was close,” says Spud. “The fire feels great, Ma.”
“Old way better, Wolf dry,” Mr. Speaks-in-third-person says.
“Wolf too tough to admit otherwise,” says Coati and smiles at him proudly..
We are all settle around the fire, leaning on fur covered chair backs, roasting our cold fingers in the warm glow of the coals.
“Many horses, my sons,” says Coati.
“One gelding, three mares,” says Wolf.
“Ah, praise the spirits.”
“Mother like horses, good ones work for us and make babies, ones she not like we sell for money,” says Wolf as he lights a pipe.
“Horse bring food. Horse bring all good things. Horse founder of civilization. All good things, horse, buffalo, sheep, cow, goat, make Injin strong,” corrects Coati, taking the proffered pipe.
“Shame history didn’t stop at horses,” I agree, accepting the pipe from Coati.
“Ah yes, the Industrial Revolution, the most important development in history? Or the most devastating horror the Cosmos has ever seen?” Sir Jacob ponders aloud.
“Pardon me, Coati, I digress and bring bad thoughts to your teepee,” says Sir Jacob. “I will return to speaking of good things. My dearest Lady Beverly has sent a round of her mighty goat cheese for your larder.” He hands a cloth wrapped parcel to Coati Chaser.
I lean over to Spud and ask, “Lady Beverly?”
“Ah, you haven’t met the great Lady? Sir Jacobs’ mother. A true aristocrat, raises goats, makes fabulous farmstead cheese. Plus Coati milks her sheep. So we get both goat and sheep cheeses and mare’s cheese in season. Living in the lap of luxury.”
Coati passes a bowl of cheese and bread around.
“Fabulous. Coati’s home ground grains baked into bread, her sheep manchego and Lady Bev’s smoky cheddar,” murmurs Spud.
We are pigging out again, with goat stew and taters as the main dish. 
“Damn, Michael would appreciate these frijoles, they from here?”
“I grow them and the grain down at my place, longer season,” says Spud.
“We winter the sheep down there too. Soon be time to head them down, ‘fore the cold weather closes in,” says Wolf.
“Soon is after tomorrow,” says Coati.
“Yes mother, if you say so, soon has arrived,” say Wolf and Spud more or less together.
Sir Jacob looks at me, winks and says, “Coati actually runs this outfit, those boys just pretend to be in charge. Given time they may attain her wisdom.” 
Wolf and Spud glare at Sir Jacob. He adds, “It may be a long time.”
“Maybe you will too, old man,” jokes Spud.
“Hell, she ain’t ready to loose the reins just yet,” says Wolf and winks at his mother. He has caught the winking disease too.
“Young men may achieve wisdom in time, maybe not. Much still to learn from elders. First lesson, learn to listen.”
“We listen occasionally,” says Spud. The boys exchange a glance.
“But with elders being scarce and time short, we need a miracle,” says Spud.
“Miracle, phht, ain’t no such thing,” I say.
“Papers and maps we bring maybe help,” says Wolf and bows his head.
“A miracle is what seems impossible, but happens anyway,” says Sir Jacob.
“Yes, Injins need miracle,” says Wolf.
“Miracles do happen,” says Spud. “Maybe just need some help happening.”
“Indeed. Idealists don’t get much done, they mainly talk and dream, it takes manual labor, even brute force to finish the job,” says Sir Jacob.
“Unfortunately, we seem to be the cannon fodder this week,” I add. “Thought I was smarter than that.”
“According to Coati, you’ve fell in with the wrong bunch fer smarts,” says Spud.
Wolf says, “We smartass, close enough.”
Sir Jacob turns to me and says, “We had an adventure a few years back, bloody kids, Spud and Wolf were maybe 12-14 years old. In this world adulthood can sneak in real early. They were raised on the frontier though, like you and your stories of Triassic, even the 10 year olds might need to wield a rifle. The eight year olds stay busy reloading.
“Things get tough, it must be done to survive. We all happened to be on the way into town to pick up supplies which were coming in on the annual cargo ship. We were coming down Badger Canyon into town from our various homes and camps, not really acquainted yet, but come to find out, of one mind.
“The Federals were looking for some outlaws who had robbed the payroll from the ship and landed here to hide. They had already scoured the town with no results.
“So being afoot and not horsemen of any kind, they set up a roadblock just outside of town. They told us if we had guns the outlaws would take them away and use them to kill us and then use them to fight the Federals.
“So they ordered us all to surrender our weapons and go into town. For our own safety, they said.
“You see, we disagreed with the first order. Those weapons were our safety. And the second order. Our homes were in the country with only us to defend them. We couldn’t abandon all our work, our livelihood for the outlaws to take, or even trash and burn to ashes.
“We picked up our guns like they asked, but then rather than surrender we raised and fired them. Took them by surprise.
“The young boys stepped up. It was Lady Beverly, Coati Chaser, myself and them, everyone else surrendered.
“We are a fine example of a scruffy group who, working together, give each other the strength to carry on. We are much greater than the sum of our parts,” says Sir Jacob.
Wolf looks up with that special light in his eyes and says, “It is what the first warrior said to the Great Spirit. I have told it before, but it bears repeating and it may be new for you Annie.
“The first warrior looked out on the land that was his home. He saw the hills and the stars and he was happy. For giving him his home, the first warrior told the Great Spirit that he would fight and win many battles in his honor. But the Great Spirit said, ‘No, do not fight for me, fight for your tribe. Fight for your family which is born to you. Fight for the brothers you find. Fight for them,’ the Great Spirit said, ‘for they are your home.’
“We have become a family and this has been our country since that day.	
“The people who surrendered their weapons? They live in town now. Fine enough people, just not cut out for this life.
“They name town after us. MadDog, used to be Dodge. That was us on that day. MadDogs, not give in.” Wolf adds in conclusion, “We are now the MadDog Clan and proud to be so.”
I am speechless, pondering on these people and their bravery. Holy cowpies.
Coati smiles and breaks the silence, “Brave warrior must feed fire in soul. Apple pie.”
Spud serves it up.
“Delicious.”
“Home grown apples, honey and wheat, beef lard. Farming has its rewards,” says Spud.
“Naught but the finest ingredients and an exceptional cook, my compliments Madam Coati,” says Sir Jacob and bows in her direction.
Soon it is time to roll into our soogans, glad to be inside with food in our bellies and the teepee skin between us and the elements. We cuddle near the hot coals which have dried and warmed us against the chill.




28  Spirits Speak


Next morning the steady drone of raindrops has stopped and we are up to greet the sun. We step out of the teepee to find a dusting of snow on the ground, less than a’ inch. Coati’s cats rub on my boots.
“Gruesome and Glacier,” says Spud.
The bitch comes out from under a thick tree. The heavy branch cover has kept her warm and dry. She wags her tail, ready to work. The cats hiss once and she cowers. Pecking order is established, they are friends.
The trio follows us around as we feed. “I fucking love the smell of hay and horse shit in the morning,” I say.
Spud says, “Cain’t argey that.”
We hop through the chores. A long night of wild and crazy sex has left us hungry and just a mite tired.
After the stock is checked and fed we get another good Coati cooked feed in our own bellies.
“Now I know why you and Wolf are such good cooks.”
Spud says, “Runs in our family. Let’s go wash off the trail dust.”
We walk out into a stand of trees and over to the base of a big red hill. Ground fog is rising with the heat of the sun.
As we round a bend a magnificent male body, all in the buff is standing on a rock above a steaming pool of water.
“Oh my gods, hell of a bathtub, love the lifelike statue,” I exclaim.
Wolf naked, long, lean and mean, smiles and dives into the spring. Plenty well endowed, I just happen to notice.
“Damn,” I say and lean over to see just how cold it is. “Holy shit, Spud. Another hot spring?”
“Life is good on the Rock.”
We strip and join Wolf, soaking our trail weary bones.
“Paradise,” I say.
Sir Jacob and Coati have wandered up, disrobed and joined us.
“Yep, that’s what we call it. But never to others, we no like share. This Injin Nation,” says Wolf from across the pool.
Spud says, “We cultivate the MadDog image expressly to keep out the riff raff.”
Sir Jacob adds, “There are a plethora of other places like this on this continental edge, it is an active volcanic slip zone. Plenty of room for others to find their own paradise. We like ours private.”
“Yes,” agrees Coati. “But this the best spring of all. We find, we claim. Homestead for MadDog Clan. Summer here, but move with sheep. Winter, sheep go to Spud homestead, low warm country, powerful ocean, good Spirits.”
Sir Jacob has closed his eyes and he and Coati, who has tilted her hat over her eyes, seem to be asleep. Or just in Nirvana.
“Yikes, you folks are all buff. Do you have a work out group or are you all gay?” I ask.
“Scared?” asks Spud.
“Okay, yikes may be the wrong word. I ain’t complainin’. The inner worlds, full of fatties. Set at a desk all day, gross.”
“We actually work. Hard, physical, outdoors. Came to this world, it had nothing but dirt, rocks, plants and animals. Brought, hauled and built all the rest ourselves. Only real problem we got here is a shortage of frontier compatible women. Not an upscale life here.” Spud pokes Sir Jacob with an elbow and adds, “‘Less yore Jakey’s gal.”
“But the Spirit Cave? More than just dirt.”
“If it exists. Intriguing, eh?” says Spud. He gets out of the pool and walks into the woods to take a leak.
Wolf swims across the pond and sets on the underwater shelf by me.
“Morning, White Eyes,” greets Wolf.
“Actually I have blue eyes, I wonder why they called them white?” I comment.
“From distance yours look white, ours look black, to man who never see only brown eyes, White Eyes look scary, maybe Spirit. After use of gun by White Eyes to kill Injin, Injin learn White Eyes is evil Spirit. White Eyes not brave like Injin who count coup by touching enemy with stick but not kill. Much more brave,” says Wolf.
Spud has walked back over. He sticks a foot in to join us and says, “Plus he memorized all them Hollywood Cowboy and Injin stories.”
“Yeah, me too.”
“Hmm,” agrees Wolf. “Hollywood: Truth.”
I look at Spud who is now soaking alongside us. “He jokin’?” I ask.
“Naw, well, truthfully, it’s hard to tell. Wolf is generally no dummy, but sometimes I wonder.”
Wolf grunts, “Hmph.”
We soak for a while, swim for a while. Man it feels good, washin’ yesterday and a thousand other cold, rain soaked outdoor days away.
“Mmmm, finest times,” I say, then close my eyes and settle down to soak some more. Soon I wake up.
Still soakin’ in the hot springs and stokin’ up another pipe, Spud and Wolf have far away looks in their eyes
Wolf asks, “I’m sittin’ here right in front of ya. I’m real right? Aren’t I real?
“I’m sittin’ here right?”
Wolf looks down at himself.
“Yeah, I am! I am absolutely certain that I exist.”
His body flickers.
“Pretty much certain...”
“If you put your mind totally into it, there is nothing you cannot accomplish,” says Spud.
I’m unconvinced. “People like to say that.”
Wolf looks at us and asks, “What is real? Is what we experience real or is it a dream? Is here here? Or have we slipped into a different dimension? When we share the Hollywood stories, are we visualizing them or are we actually in them? Are we then or are we now?”
“Oh good gods, Wolf, not trans dimensional migration again. Next you’ll be spouting time travel,” says Spud.
“White Eyes!” Wolf says in mock disgust. “Wolf slip into past time now, before White Eyes ruin Injin peace and quiet.”
Spud says to me quietly, “See? Complicated,” and laughs.
We finally drag our wrinkled bodies out of the pool into the rapidly warming morning air. The snow is about all gone except in the deepest shadows.
“Last few warm days of fall, methinks,” proclaims Sir Jacob.
“Best we enjoy ‘em while we can,” agrees Spud.
“Our booty awaits, let us reassemble at the teepee map table,” says Sir Jacob.
“Map table?” I ask rhetorically. No one answers, so I guess that makes it retroactive rhetorical.
We dress and clomp down the trail into a second teepee, where there is indeed a tabletop set on folding saw horses.
“We store in root cellar for winter,” says Coati. “Some things stay, less to move to new camp.”
“When do you move?” I ask, the greenhorn of the bunch.
“Tomorrow. You help, earn yore beans,” says Spud with an arm hugging my shoulders.
“Whole camp?”
Coati nods.
“Be glad of the extry horses. You may not have to walk.”
Wolf and Sir Jacob are bent over the maps and papers, consulting in low voices. I pass around cups of joe.
Spud and I go to an unoccupied end of the table and they pass things they have examined to us. Coati floats around taking it all in.
After a few hours of inspection Coati grunts, “Hmph,” and goes about making lunch.
“I’m glad to help,” I offer.
“Coati think better while working, you read more.”
After a while we sit down to buffalo backstrap, greens and sourdough biscuits.
Wolf intones, “Life is long and wonderful, it ebbs and flows, like perennials in a garden.
“Sometimes they are blooming, sometimes they are dormant, but they are always alive.”
I shrug my shoulders and say, “Things change, unexpected things happen. Is that what you are saying?”
“Mm. The only constant in life is change,” remarks Wolf.
“He’s a well-read Injin,” Spud says.
Coati looks at Wolf. “You have thoughts, my son?”
“Sir Jacob and I see too many Spirit Caves on map, take lifetime to ride to them all.”
“It still looks like misdirection or code,” Sir Jacob says. “Or a shitload of bloody Spirit Caves.”
“How spiritual were the forefathers? Many tribes, many caves? But how all make one map? No, Sir Jacob, you are right. Something different is going on here,” says Wolf.
“Maybe they are missile emplacements, disguised,” says Sir Jacob.
Laughter all around, then sober expressions appear on our faces. Thoughts of the warlike centrists and their past atrocities can’t help but send shivers down our spines. Please not here too, we must all be thinking. I surely am.
After lunch we look and read more, the afternoon passes by. We get out for a short midafternoon walk and inspection of the camp and grounds. So beautiful, helps clear our minds from all the words and drawings. And gives tired eyes a rest.
“It is indeed a case of too much information, not really informational, just a bunch of saved papers, with no rhyme or reason,” I say as we return to the table. “My head is spinning.”
“Yeah, but there are some things...” Spud speech tapers off as he reads a new treatise.
Wolf sits back, groans and moves over by the fire, throwing a log on the coals. As the sun lowers, the air is cooling the teepee.
“Okay, time for pipe, food, digest, take dream journey. Later.” Wolf leaves.
“He’s goin’ Zen again,” jokes Spud
“Wolf can’t go Zen, Wolf is Zen,” says Sir Jacob.
“True, native is Zen. Proud to be his brother,” says Spud.
“What do we do?” I ask.
“Follow Wolf’s lead. The mind needs time to ponder all we have seen and work it out.”
“I got a couple of things to check,” says Spud and rifles through a stack of papers. “One of us is bound to have found a trigger to get our minds wrapped around it. We think, we mull, we dream, we talk. By the time we move camp down the hill tomorrow, we are likely to have an idea. Hopefully, a good one. Let’s go scarf up some grub. We still got the evening to look at all this again. In the morning, weather permitting, we pack up. Load the travois. When the mind is occupied with menial tasks, it works best.”
We go to the other teepee. Coati is standing by the fire. Wolf is stirring something that smells delicious and flipping tortillas on the skillet.
“What’s for dinner, brother?”
“Wolf stew. Coati shot a big one the other day, can’t let it go to waste, homemade tortillas to dip,” Wolf says.
“Mmmm, dog tacos, my favorite.” Spud curls his lip in disgust and hugs Coati. “Hope there’s lots a salsa to cover the dog taste.”
Later I slide into sleep, mulling, wondering. I am standing on the edge of a cliff shouting across a canyon. Does the response come from the spirits or is it my own voice echoing back at me? It seems from my side of the canyon that the quest for unity with the spirits is the source of much of the worlds’ unhappiness. All I have learned thus far in life is that there are no answers, only more questions. The more I learn the more there is to learn, vastly more.


29  Nomadic Migration


Before dawn we are up catching the camp chickens and guineas out of the trees. Wolf, Coati, and Spud shinny up them like they’ve been doing it all their lives, which they likely have. Suckers are quick, though some get away. Sir Jacob and I are on the ground with j-hooks to help catch and corral the escapees. They have poor night vision, so we do have an advantage. Coati has built a homemade cage to stick them in for the journey, which we will lash to a travois for the trip to the next camp. We move quick and mostly stay warm. Spud comes down and gets a big net on a long stick to help corral the wiliest. Then when daylight arrives, the last of them come into the cages for the seed Coati sprinkles out.
Another fabulous, but extremely frosty, morning eventually dawns. My fingers and toes are numb by the time we finish feeding. Sir Jacob has got a blaze going to warm us while we eat breakfast. The fresh deer sausage, fried taters, homemade biscuits and eggs prove that Sir Jacob is a true cowboy cook. They hit the spot. We and our charges are soon done eatin’ and ready to pack up.
Wolf and Spud are striking teepees and Sir Jacob and I are throwing sawbucks on the pack animals. Coati is packing the last cases and full panniers and pairing them by weight for each steed. We work fast to keep the blood flowing, glad of our warm fur parkas, scarves and gloves.
After we fold the last teepee cover and strike the poles, we set the poles up as travois for the loads which are the bulky and odd shaped items not given to riding atop a horse or in the panniers. Chickens and guinea fowl being one of them. The camp guardian dog doesn’t carry a load this trip, as we have enough horses for the job. His priority is to protect his fowl in any case.
The cats go atop their favorite horse’s saddle in a little open basket with a branch jail cell arrangement over the top. Their favorite horse is the cat tame one who always carries them. Horses in general are not fans of any member of the cat family. Nor are cats much in the way of horsemen.
Coati says, “We tied Glacier to the sawbuck first few times we moved, but now she’ll ride up top in the basket, happy as a clam. We had to add the crisscross branches for Gruesome this time though, it’s his first ride. We don’t want to lose our mousers.”
Eventually we are ready to mount up and hit the trail. Our mounts have been standing in the shade so are still cold backed. They hump up at the touch of the cold blankets. I lead Spike in circles until his saddle blankets have warmed and his spine has flattened out. He is a confirmed cold blanket bucker. Leading him out is my old home remedy to forestall buckin’. Works for me. Everyone looks sideways at me, not having ever seen such a thing.
Spud throws his blanket and saddle on, reefs down on the cinches and hops aboard for a little morning fun.
“Ride ‘em Cowboy!” I yell, getting in the swing of things. I have been careful to stay on the ground as buckin’ is contagious. Sir Jacob’s horse agrees, going for the big jump. Sir Jake rides her out. Just a taste of crow hoppin’, nothin’ serious. Spud’s horse, on the other hand, bucks like a pro for quite a while.
As Spud picks himself up off the ground he says, “Ahh, I love a pitchin’ horse in the mornin’. Better’n sex.” He smiles at me.
“Sheeit!” I say.
The rest of us smart people, who some would call cowards, then mount our horses, after making them untrack and checking them for calmness.
As we turn the old pack string loose, we have another little cold back rodeo, and have to reset and readjust a few loads, but it is all in a mornings work. While we are doing this, Wolf’s horse has been entertaining us.
Wolf says, as he also picks himself up off the ground, “Maybe Annie have good idea.”
“Worked back home on Triassic, we rode dinosaurs there,” I say, tongue in cheek.
The morning looks good, sunny and warm. However, marching soldiers are in the sky to remind us that real weather is just about to hit.
“Them clouds are a sure sign of a front; cold, snowy, windy too, maybe,” says Coati.
“Yep, time of year for it,” I agree.
We head up to the pass with our strings of novice pack horses, two to a rider, tailed up, Coati’s sheep and their two guardian dogs, and the experienced pack horses who run loose. The camp dog is at Coati’s mount’s heels.
Two shepherds appear on horseback with a flock of sheep, a few pack goats carrying their gear and two more guardian dogs. They all join the caravan.
“Those herders don’t have a lot of age on them,” I say to Wolf, who is stirrup to stirrup beside me.
“Little brother and sister, Leaping Panther and Kit Fox. They in charge of flocks.”
“I didn’t see them at the meals.”
“They carry food and camp on pack goats, stay out, follow grass. Dogs help. Coati resupply them.”
We are in the lead with the loose pack stock following. The kids on their brightly painted horses are riding flank with Spud. Sir Jacob and Coati are behind the horses. They stop to let the livestock mingle in with the pack horses. They then ride drag. Their job is to be sure none of the animals get left behind. Their tail end position is usually perfect for folks who like to eat dust, but in this grass covered paradise there, amazingly, is none.
Sir Jacob rides up the side of the herd, looking at how packs are riding. Once we get things rolling well, we will stop and check cinches and loads on everyone again.
As he pulls up to me, he asks, “Any thoughts?”
I say, “I don’t know if y’all noticed, but when you three arrived at the Short Branch the night of the fight, Soames had a sudden need to get the heck out of there. He even held his hat alongside his head, slowly putting it on as he passed the bar. My thought is that he didn’t want someone at the bar to see him.”
“I saw that too. Having now seen the Spirit Cave maps, I would think it to be Lone Wolf,” says Sir Jacob. “With luck, we will know more when Michael checks in.”
“He will not be able to find us, we may have to go to town for him,” says Wolf.
“Hells bells, you think only Injins can follow sign? Michael’s a country boy, he can track my horse through hell or high water. We’ve rode together a long time, he’s found me more than once. Just a matter of when he gets the info we need from Soames.”
“Mm, we see. It is said in some cultures that a shape shifter person is a shaman with great powers.”
“Uh huh,” more Injin mumbo jumbo, I think.
We ride along for a few hours, enjoying the sun and life in general. Chasing strays back into line and keeping one eye open whilst mostly loafing. Bitch turns out to be a good dog, got the instinct and mimics the experienced dogs.
Eventually we top a rise. I can see forever, almost. We are surrounded by the grassland prairie, dotted with buffalo. I look back at our little herd of sheep, pack goats and horses along with the travois horses, Coati in her Injin dress, Sir Jacob resplendently noble as always. Spud in buckskins. The herd dogs and the guardian dogs, the cats in their basket on the sawbuck.
Then I turn back to Wolf  who has doffed his jacket and is in nothin’ but leggins and paint. Damn, his sexy chest looks like it oughta be sportin’ goose bumps from the chill. I get goose bumps just lookin’ at it.
“Whatcha lookin’ at?” asks Wolf.
“Nice paint job, Kemo Sabe. When do you find the time?” I say, red faced.
I look back toward the caravan to calm my beating heart before it rips right out of my chest.
Whew. Speechless I am, too many whirling thoughts, amazed.
Wolf looks around and says, “Spirit alive in time of buffalo. Injin rule all horizon. North. South. East. West. Sky. Ground. All.”
“But always things change, unexpected things happen.” Spud has ridden up beside us.
“Life is long and wonderful, ebb and flow, like tide, like life on the prairie.”
“Sometimes sky hot and plants are growing and blooming, then sun sleep, cold come, perennials still alive, slowly working on their root system through cold times. Waiting for the sun to return their warmth again then they grow leaves, branches, flowers and seed. Continue cycle of life. Sometimes blooming, sometimes dormant, but always alive. Cycle goes, round and round. The same but never the same. Always evolving. Only constant in life is change,” remarks Wolf.
Spud looks at me and says, “Like I said, he’s a well-read savage.”
Then he looks out across the prairie and waves an arm out toward the caravan. “The MadDog Clan at its finest.”
“May the gods bless our passage,” prays Wolf.
“Shit, the gods been dead a long damn time,” I grumble.
“Mnh mnh,” Wolf shakes his head, then smiles with a twinkle in his eye. He raises a fist, taps his chest and says, “Lone Wolf still alive.”




30  Winter Quarters


As we come over the top of what Spud assures me is the last pass, and start down into a draw, we can see the ocean. It appears endless and deceptively smooth from this height.
“Whoo ta!” whoops Wolf.
“Ah hey ya,” says Coati sounding like she is praying. She looks at me. “Thanking the gods for good weather and a safe journey.”
“We ain’t there yet,” says Spud.
“My practical boy,” Coati says.
We look down the trail, all strung out on the switchbacks with sheep and goats cutting across, and down the steep hillside, dogs and kids mixed in among them. Quite a sight. The older animals have made the trip before and are speeding up, knowing they are headed home. Soon Spike whinnies and a herd of horses comes loping around a bend far below us.
“Ah, the sights we see.” Sir Jacob has joined us at the pass. He pulls a bottle from his saddle bags. “Cheers!” He pops the top and we all have a swig.
I look at Sir Jacob who is admiring the horses, too, with shining eyes. I recognize a kindred spirit,
“I worship horses,” I say.
Jacob nods. “Oh yes, quite. Magnificent beasts.”
“I fucking worship the ground a good horse walks on. Think about it. If man hadn’t had horses, our whole history could be different, hell, maybe we would still be in caves. Before people figured it out, everything was carried on your back. Folks walked everywhere,” I say, maybe a tad into my cups, but thinkin’ brilliantly.
“I have heard people say that hunter gatherers spent two hours a day gathering and lolled around the rest of the time,” says Sir Jacob.
“Have those numb nuts tried gathering?” I ask. “Are they fucking kidding me? Not only was enough food to get through the day hard to find, once you ate a few days food you had to find more. You couldn’t just go back to your cave and open the fridge, pop open a beer and kick back. Naw, you had to move to a new area, ‘cause you done ate all the food within walkin’ distance of your cave yesterday. No one lived the easy life unless they lived on fucking Fantasyland 3000.
“Back in the real stone age cave days, no fuckin’ way! Then some smart ass hunting sucker looked at the horse he was sneaking up on, planning on eating him for dinner and he thought, ‘Hey, you know, maybe there’s a more efficient way to do this.’ Light bulb!
“Hell yea. Musta taken some trial and error. Probably tried a few other species too, but man, even getting an animal to carry yore backpack load would greatly increase yore ability to survive.
“That likely happened first, they found some old almost dead or wounded horse so weak they could get close and thought, ‘If I can move this sucker to camp alive, I won’t have to carry all these fucking loads of his dead meat.’ So they gather around on the away from camp side of the beast and wave their arms, thinking of all the miles of walking back and forth they would save. Then of course they realize it ain’t as easy as it seems ‘cause the beast doesn’t want to go where they do. So in all the runnin’ around, Joe Cave Man gets a blister on his shoulder from his damn pack, and thinks, ‘Hey I could tie this fucking pack on the beast’s back. He could carry it home.’
“Eventually someone thinks, ‘How about we put a rope around its neck and drag it. If eight of us pull on the rope, we can budge him.’ Took some time, no doubt.”
Wolf looks up and says, “Had to have started with dogs maybe? Smaller and easier to bribe with food. Eat same food we do. Tasted our trash, eventually hung around our camps for scraps. They packed things first. Hell yeah. Injins packed dogs ‘fore white man brought horses over to Injin lands and lost ‘em. Explains why the villages were full of the mangy beggin’ suckers. Horse replaced them, they were unemployed and bored.”
“But the horse, ah, the horse,” I continue. “It was and is the perfect animal, the right size, tough feet, reasonable temperament, carries loads, carries us, pulls travois, wagons, walks in circles, runs mills, mine hoists, shit it’s fucking perfect. The best will even be yore pardner.” I reach down and pet Spike.
“But damn, they musta been wild, had to have been a lot of rodeos at first, figuring it out. Whoo fuckin’ ta! Them cave dudes were the real deal. Cowboy on!!!”
I’d made one hell of a speech and proud of it. Wolf passes me the bottle.
“A toast to our best pal, and all his four hooves!” says I and pass it to Coati.
“Heavenly Horse!” Coati raises the bottle, takes a swig and hands it off to Sir Jacob.
Sir Jacob raises the bottle and says, “To the sunny slopes of long ago.”
“Hell of a history, and now we got fuckin’ space ships and the whole Cosmos. Shit, maybe if we never had the horse, life would have been better off. Ooooh ta!” adds Wolf then drinks.
“Naw, just not the infernal combustion engine. Horses fucking rule!” I am nothing if not stubborn.
Now Spud raises his weary head and gazes off into the distance, glassy eyed. “Heh heh heh, yeah, I spent a month there once. Oh yeah!”
I look over at him and bite. “There?”
“Fantasy fucking land 3000. Kicked ass! Cost me a year’s pay, but fuck me. I loved it. All them hot ass cowgirls. Yee Fucking Haw!”
“You think the whorehouse in MadDog is somethin’, brothers, you oughta try Fantasyland 3000. A whorehouse ain’t nothin’. Fantasy’s a fucking whore fucking planet! Good gawd, took me six months to recuperate.”
We all kick up our trusty steeds and head on down to join the herd.
It has been one hell of a journey and Spud’s bed is soft and companion filled.



31  Knock, knock


‘Knock, knock.’
“Shit, arggghhh, we’re sleepin’.”
‘Knock, knock.’
“Groan.” Spud reaches across me. “What?”
“Someone at the door.”
He puts on pants.
I open my eyes. “Say it ain’t mornin’.”
‘Knock, knock, knock.’ More insistent.
Spud staggers up, stumbles over his boots. “Fuck.”
Sits down to put them on.
“Son of a bitch.”
Stands up, wavers.
Regains his balance.
“Somebody better be dead!”
Lurches toward the stairs.
‘Knock, knock.’
“Cocksucker, I’m coming!!!
“Motherfucker.” Then crashing.
‘Knock, knock.’
“I said, somebody better be dead.”
I can hear him fumbling. “Shit, it’s locked.
“Hold on!” he yells at the door.
“Annie, bring the frickin’ key.
“Please.”
I tumble out of bed head first and find the key where it fell out of his pants.
“Coming!” Then he yells, “It’s the Sabbath, you should be in church, I should be sleepin’ in. Whoever the fuck you are.”
“It’s me. Sky.”
I get downstairs, hand the bleary eyed Spud the key.
He unlocks and opens the door. “Sky, it’s the middle of the fucking night.”
“It’s almost dawn Spud. Charley sent me, she says it’s urgent. She said to bring the crew, be prepared, act like you’re coming in on other business, not to meet her. Meet by tonight before nine, Soames has plans for tomorrow, so the sooner the better.
“Charley said to tell you personally, Annie, ‘it is urgent that you don’t forget Bob.’”
“Oh, okay,” I say, dumbfounded.
Spud looks at me. “Who’s Bob?”
I look at him. “Aargh, coffee, we need coffee.”
“I’ll get the pot on, then go feed. You go wake the troops. Bob, too. Whoever the fuck he is.”
I go out on the porch and ring the big bell.
“Come in, Sky, we’re usually up by now, long day yesterday. Sorry, you musta rode all night yoreself,” I say.
“Naw, I flew in. Under the radar. Puddle jumper. Not to worry. Wasn’t seen. Could use some coffee though.”
Spud heads over to the counter. “Oh. Someone already made it.”
He pours three cups and hands Sky and I each one.
Sky takes his and yawns. “Tired.”
“Yep, no rest for the weary,” I say.
“No rest for the wicked either,” Spud says.
Sir Jake steps into the room and says, “Actually, there is rest for neither the wicked nor the weary. Nor many of the rest of folks either.” He steps over and pours himself a cup.
After a sip he says, “Top o’ the mornin’, Sky, thought I heard you glide in.” They clink cups.
Spud looks at Sky. “What else you know?”
“Nothin’ actually, I’ve told you all she told me. Charley knocked me up early and said maybe I knew where you lived, she was gonna send a letter through Cayuse. I said since the moon was full, I was faster. My hopper was a ways out of town, behind that big hill, so no one is likely to have seen, even if they were still awake.”
“‘Preciate it, hours ahead of the Cayuse, gives us time to catch some fresh horses. We just brung in the sheep yesterday, got in by the moonlight ourselves.”
“And we must clean and reload our weapons,” adds Sir Jacob.
Wolf and Coati come in with steaming pots of food. “Break. Fast,” she says, in two words.
Sky gives them each a hug and says, “Perfect timing, I’m starved.”
Spud stares. “You already stirrin’?”
“Me not weak from spilling seed,” says Wolf.
“You fed too?”
“Kids feeding, no worry, little slaves back. I remember when you two were my little slaves. Sky too sometimes.” Coati smiles at the memory. “Mother home now. Keep you out of trouble.”
“Phew, Sky. You come and saved us just in time. We was about to get mothered to death.” Spud laughs and hugs Coati.
Another fine morning over breakfast at Spud’s. I could get used to this.
Wolf and Coati have made chicken and taters for breakfast, along with the usual rashers and eggs.
“Two kinds of meat for breakfast sure fills the void after a long ride,” says Spud.
“I don’t understand why they say dinosaurs went extinct,” I say as I pick up a chicken breast.
Spud says, “All this shit going on, the interlopers, the weather shuttin’ down early so we had to get the sheep camp moved. All them extry days, them cattle have about et theirselves out of house and home. My buyer, Ginger, wanted them yesterday so he will come to us. We just gotta run ‘em down to the stock pens outside MadDog. We should be in town in plenty of time to meet with Charley.”
After vittles, Spud and I go up to his bedroom for a’ extra quickie, then as we get dressed I pick up my vet wraps. As I start to tightly wrap my chest, I explain to the quizzical Spud. “I was accused of murder three times, twice falsely. That’s where Bob came in. He was my ticket off of Mauka and Makai.”
I have rendered my breasts, which ain’t much to brag about in any case, just about nonexistent. Since I ain’t over endowed on the top side, and tall as I am, I can easily pass for a man. Height hurts in the finding of a husband or a date part of life, but it is a hell of a help in keeping a low profile get out of jail free kind of way.
I wrap my hair up atop my head, swipe some charcoal for five o’clock shadow, pull my hat down low and voila, Bob’s your uncle or some such.
I look at Spud. “Just don’t call me Annie.”
Spud gives me a shit eatin’ grin and says, “Yo, Bob.”
We head out to the corral. Spud says, “Boys, meet Bob our new ranch hand.”
Sir Jacob comes over looking puzzled. “New?” 
He eyes me.
I stick out a paw and say, “Pleasure, sir.”
“Bob, is it?”
“Charley said I should come into town incognito. Only Michael knows Bob, he must have talked to her. Something going down, must have a reason.”
“I say. Robert, I have a few accoutrements which will render thee less feminine. Please accompany me to my parlor,” says Sir Jacob as he raises an elbow to escort me.
“Time’s a wastin’, boys.”
“Beg pardon, Spud, we are off to the loo, important business to attend to. After, we shall join you.”
Sir Jake and I head for the mirror. Sir Jake opens a leather case, fumbles a bit and says, “Close your eyes.”
Spud has joined us and is giggling.
“Ain’t masculine to giggle, girls,” I grouse, eyes tight shut.
They stick something to my lip.
“Are you kidding?”
“No wigglin’!” says Spud. “No peekin’ either.”
Sir Jacob adjusts something. Then he says, “Righto. Now you may look.”
“Holy chicharones. I always wanted a handlebar mustache! Very cool!”
“You’d a’ made a handsome man. Not sure I wanna kiss you now though,” says Spud. Then he proceeds to kiss me. “Well, hell. Maybe I am queer.”
“I’d say so,” I, ah, say.
“We all indubitably agree that you are a queer one, pardner, albeit, I think, not a homosexual,” says Sir Jacob.
“Okay, we better get a move on. No kissin’ me in public Bob,” says Spud. “I wouldn’t want all the girls on the Rock to go into mourning.”
“Hey, you kissed me.”
Spud smiles that shit eatin’ grin again, gotta love him.
“Okay, Sir Spud, we shall expedite the saddling. After you my dear friend, Robert.”
We head out to catch and saddle our mounts,
Wolf rides in just as I am about to mount, reaches down and slaps me on the ass as he goes by.
“Didn’t know you swung that way Wolf,” says Spud.
“Injin not fool. Annie still have lady ass.”
“I was hoping the baggy vest would help hide my fat ass.”
“Nope,” deadpans Wolf.
“Shit, yore supposed to say it’s shapely, not fat.”
Silence. Wolf still deadpan.
Oh well. “Bob is the name, Wolf. Don’t forget.”
“Yes siree Bob.” Wolf salutes insolently and lopes off.




32  Ginger


When we get to the downwind side of the MadDog stock pens that evening the smell ignites memories of my stockyard job on Terrania. It was a good place to get a bunch of pen sorting experience and make a few bucks to climb the starway to a better planet.
As we close in, we see that the aptly named redhead, Ginger and crew are waiting and my handlebar ‘stache is perfect.
“I believe I’m the best lookin’ cowhand in the whole shaggy bunch,” I say.
“What?” asks Lone Wolf, incredulously.
“Did I say that out loud?”
“Yep. Only second best.”
“Why?”
“Lone Wolf here.”
“Sheeeit.”
Spud and Ginger count the cattle as Wolf, Sir Jacob and I work with Ginger’s three cowhands to keep them together and push them single file into the pens. We all dismount and Ginger gets out his money. A laser dot appears on his forehead as he steps over to hand Spud the money.
“Shit!” Spud sees it, knocks Ginger and me both over as he dives to the ground. I look up carefully and see the cowhand behind Ginger collapse like a rag doll.
Then we hear the shot.
Shooting starts in earnest. We have all hit the dirt but Wolf, who I see crab off behind the horses into the brush and disappear out of sight.
I dive over behind a rock and say, “Shit! Why are they shootin’ at us?”
“It’s likely the Centrists,” says Sir Jacob, hopping off his horse and laying him over. His sorrel horse, Stew, will provide cover and be a smaller target himself layin’ down.
“Okay, but my question is, why are they shootin’ at us?”
Spud looks over at me from behind his rock and says, “It’s a sign we must be doin’ something right.”
“Oh fuck yeah!” says Sir Jacob, laying on his back and reloading.
“I don’t understand.”
“If we’re pissing them off, it is. Can’t be helped. They only aren’t pissed off if we toe their line. We do what we believe in, we draw hot lead, simple.”
“Aha.”
I turn and see the Wolf’s feathered hat through the brush. I am about to shout a warning when a bullet rips through it.
“Fuck,” I whisper. “Wolf’s hit!”
Spud whispers, “Shh, play dead.”
A minute or two passes.
“Drop ‘em!” Wolf’s voice.
We hear the sound of the shooters dropping their weapons.
Spud looks at me and says, “Just his hat.”
The buyer’s not dead, but his entire crew is, so the deal goes through.
“It don’t make us outlaws in my book. We are just defending what is ours. ‘Course, Federals may disagree,” Spud says.
“May? Bloody hell, you are still inhabiting Fantasyland,” says Sir Jacob.
Spud looks over at Ginger and says, “Got lucky, Ginger. We’ll help you load.”
“We all have our days,” says Ginger. He gestures at his dead cowboys. “Wasn’t theirs.”
Ginger and Spud shake on the deal.
Wolf brings the shooters over, hands tied behind their backs. He has retrieved his hat. He has a finger stuck through yet another hole.
I walk over and take a look. “Through and through, glad yore head weren’t in it.”
“Spirits watch over us today,” Wolf says solemnly.
“You know them?” he asks Ginger.
“No, never seen them before.”
Wolf trusses up the two shooters, mounts up and leads off with them tied by a long rope to the saddle horn.
“What’s the Injin gonna do with them?”
“My brother will take them to the pokey. Prisoners build roads and bridges hereabouts unless they confess. Keep them out of trouble while we figure out what they are up to. They break the rules bad enough, we export them off planet.”
“Yore brother? Oh, sorry, no offense, he’s just awful tan.”
“Yeah, Ginger, ‘cause he is a’ Injin.”
“Oh, sorry.”
“It’s okay, he knows he’s a’ Injin. I imagine the feathers mighta gave it away for you.”
Ginger’s skin is as red as his hair by now. He says, “Ahem, I’ll just get these cattle lined out.”
“It’s okay Ginger, Bob and I will help. Which way is yore ship?”
After we get the cattle loaded I ask, “None of my business, but I never saw a bill of sale?”
“Nope, handshake is best. Don’t want anyone to be able to trace Ginger’s cattle back to us.”
“But they’re branded.”
“Not with any brand registered to me. Brands around here are a matter of local knowledge. None of Central’s business.”
“So, they will be beeflegged?”
“Didn’t ask. Belong to Ginger now. Not my business.”
“Loose lips?”
“Sink their owners. Fortunately, it’s a big Galaxy.”
As we ride into town, Wolf catches up with us having dispensed with his prisoners somehow. Might be better not to ask, I think.
I say to Lone, “You know how it is when you’ve been out killing and you come into a party and everyone else just finished a day of pushing papers across a desk?”
“Your experience is so different, it’s hard to fit in, eh?”
“Naw, I just feel way superior to those worker ants. I’m the frickin’ Queen.”
“Off with their heads,” says Wolf. “Queen is right, Bob.”
“Oh, yeah, Bob, I plumb forgot.” We laugh as we ride around the last big boulder into town. “Shit!”
Whole squad of federales have set up a roadblock on Main Street. We ride up quietly.
“State your business.”
“Just come in fer supplies, your Honor,” says Spud. He doffs his hat.
“Officer.”
“Yes sir, Officer, your Honor.”
“You know anything about a shooting earlier?”
“Whereabouts? What happened?”
“Where have you been?”
“We just come from my ranch, like I said, need supplies. The boys,” he gestures at us, “are thirsty.”
They look us each over carefully; I realize that Lone Wolf Hole in Hat isn’t with us. He just was, we were talking about ants. Them Injins truly are smart, slick and silent.
The troops eyeball us all for a bit, apparently waiting for us to melt under their superior gaze. Then they pose a few more pointless questions.
Sir Jacob finally offers, “Beg pardon, gentleman. While we are happy to answer whatever queries you may have, we are but local ranchers. We just want to live out in the country, mind our own p’s and q’s, pints and quarts as it were, and not be bothered. It has been quite successful until now. What do you wish that we do?”
The little guy with the most spaghetti on his hat puffs hisself up at this. He walks over to Sir Jacob, looks him up and down with obvious contempt and says, “Papers. We will need them from everyone, now!”
“Of course, at your service, Captain,” says Sir Jacob. He bows, stuffs a hand in his pocket and hands over his passcard.
The Captain looks it over with a scowl, then his expression changes. “My apologies, your Lordship,” and hands it back.
“These are my minions,” says Sir Jacob. He sweeps an arm to encompass us all.
“Of course, your Lordship, you and your party may go.”
Amazingly, we are released forthwith and without a body cavity search. A good thing, too. Bob is without papers, how would we explain that?
We head on around the next turn and there sits Wolf. Looking as usual smart, slick, silent and superior.
His eyes sparkle in the evening sun. “Why you go through roadblock, White Eyes?”
Spud takes the bait. “Distract those suckers, Injin, so you can sneak around.”
“Likely saved yore skinny ass,” I add, thinking how truly fine his skinny ass is.
“Least they didn’t take our armaments.”
As we ride the last few blocks to the saloon I see a kid playing with toy cars. I look around at my compañeros. “Any of you ever been to Gearhead?”
“Not I,” says Sir Jacob. “What is it like?”
“Well, up on Gearhead they got them old timey unmotivated vehicles ain’t got room for even one horse in ‘em. Whole time I was there I couldn’t figure out what the heck good they were.”
“Hm.”
“Shit, the motivated vehicles are gross enough, but at least you just set and watch the scenery. The old timey vehicles don’t drive theirselves. You have to steer with both hands, push pedals with your feet, and watch forward, aft, port and starboard constantly fer critters, other vehicles, walkers, trees, bushes, holes, hills. Crazy amount of work. It’s downright exhaustin’. They are like magnetically drawn to trees. They hold two people and go so fast that when I had my turn I ‘bout killed myself and Michael both.
“They can’t fit down a trail either, too fat. Actually they do best with wide roads built especially for ‘em, like eight feet wide. Won’t just go cross country like a Green River cart. Then you still gotta pull off the road to let other vehicles pass. Crazy.
“At least a horse can watch and think and motivate theirselves. Although of occasion they do get devious. Are you guys laughin’ at me?”
We arrive at the saloon, dismount and tie our steeds, and stomp straight in to slake our aforementioned thirst.
“Fix us up kind sir, your finest black label,” says Sir Jacob, as he slides coins across the bar.
“Why the roadblock? What’s this about a shooting?” Spud asks the bartender.
The barkeep sets up glasses, opens a dark bottle and says, “Some guy killed in the alley last night, big shootout. Soames says they were bushwhacked. He set up the roadblock. That Spanish Don friend of his got it.”
“In the alley?” asks Spud.
“Yep, right outside the back door. Charley was tending bar, said she heard it all. Guess she went out and tried to save the Don.”
I can feel the blood leaving my face. “Dead?” I ask, too shocked to remember to lower my voice.
“Robert is a gentle soul, no fan of gunplay,” Sir Jacob says to cover for me, holding out his glass.
The bartender refills our glasses.
Sir Jacob raises his glass and says, “Bottoms up boys. A toast to life everlasting.”
I raise my glass and throw it back. Jesus, Michael.
“Another. Leave the bottle,” I say and toss coins on the bar.
“Corner table’s open boys, let’s set,” says Spud. “Never easy to hear of a shooting. Life on the frontier provides too many reminders of our mortality.”
We head back to the table and sit.
Sir Jacob raises his glass for another toast. “To death, may we not meet it soon.”
I am having trouble controlling my tear ducts. A fourth shot is bound to help. Damn.
Before I can pour, Spud puts a hand over my glass and says, “Enough Bob, there are supplies to buy. Business to attend to. What with bushwhackers about, we must stay sharp. Bring the bottle. Time’s a wastin’.”
“But,” I start.
“Now, son. Listen to your elders,” says Sir Jacob.
Spud grabs my arm. “Now, Bob. You’ve had enough.”
We head out into the alley.
“Don’t mess up the tracks.”
Lone, Spud and Sir Jacob look over the sign.
“Too damn many people have trampled though here. Let’s go talk to Charley.”
We head on out of the alley and down the block to Charley’s house. Sir Jacob knocks a special pattern. “Charley, it’s your knight in shining armor.”
Charley opens the door, looks out, spots me, says, “Sorry, no barflies at my residence, go back to the bar and have a round on me.”
“Wait,” says Spud. “Bob is okay.”
“You sure? I ain’t,” says Charley. She starts closing the door.
“You all wait out here,” says Sir Jacob and turns back to the door. “Let me in for one quick smooch, love. Then I will leave too.”
“Just you, here in the mudroom. I don’t want no drunkards in my house,” says Charley. “I see too many in the bar every fucking day.”
“No problem, Charley, we’ll leave,” says Spud as he bows. “Meet you at the Short Branch, Jakey.”
We start walking back. Spud says, “That’s good actually.”
“Good?”
“Yeah, she didn’t recognize you. Sir Jacob will get the skinny.”
We get back to the boardwalk and I sit down on the edge. All I can think of is my partner. I take another swig of the bottle. Spud holds his hand out and I hand it to him. He caps it and takes it over to his horse, shoves it into the saddlebags.
He comes back and says, “Just wait, we don’t know what the play is. Give Sir Jake and Wolf a chance to investigate.”
Sir Jacob appears around the corner just then. “Charley says she is sorry, she just didn’t know you. She’s real nervous about this whole thing. Wants us to go back. She would not tell me any more. Said she’ll explain and feed us lunch.”
He looks me in the eye and says, “Bob, she said to tell you to be patient, it’s a virtue.”
We troop back to Charley’s. I wipe my cheeks, which are dripping with tears.
She lets us in, gives me a hug and says, “I’m sorry.”
Oh crap, water works, I start bawling like a baby.
“Here, come back here, you’ll feel better with some privacy.”
“N’No, I...”
Spud throws an arm around my shoulders. “Come on darlin’, he was a good man. It’ll take a while. I’ll go with you.” He hugs me and we walk down the hall toward the back of the house. Charley opens a door and gestures us into a dark room.



33  Spaced Out


Charley lights a candle. There is a bed and a night stand.
A weak voice says, “Reports of my death are premature.”
“Holy cow, yore alive!” I rush forward.
Charley puts an arm out and stops me. “Whoa there girl, he is fragile.”
“Damn, boy,” says Spud. “Guess we gotta take back the farewell toasts. Not that we could even admit we knew ya in public. ‘Bob’ here near spilt the beans.”
I sit down gingerly on the bed and give Michael a buss on the cheek. We hold hands. “Yeah, never thought I cared about yore sorry ass, guess I do.”
“Sorry if I worried you Annie. Thinkin’ it’s best if they believe I am dead.”
“But how?”
Wolf steps in. “Ho, brother!”
He comes over and does a tricky Injin handclasp. “We wrote you off the books.”
Michael says, “Good to be here seeing you all. As I was saying, Soames come over after the shot and saw the blood spurting out, said ‘You’re done’. He just turned and left. So much for true love. Guess he just wanted to pump me for local knowledge. Or just plain pump me.
“It was a pretty serious bleeder, femoral artery, fortunately Charley showed up with crazy glue, saved me. Never thought glue would stop an arterial pump like that. Woman’s amazing. Glue is, too.”
“And the trip with Soames?” asks Spud.
“Didn’t go so well. Maybe he got a new boyfriend in my absence.
“We got to the line shack, found the body, he got quiet, worrying ‘bout his treasure I imagine.
“Then he shot off lickety split to the root cellar. Soames ignored the bodies there too and rushed into the root cellar, told me to wait outside. When he come out, oooh, dogies, he was pissed. He ran around throwing things, searching bodies. Went back inside, threw some more stuff, cussed a blue streak for such a tight ass holier than thou motherfucker. No concern for his people being dead. I began to wonder if he was human or one of them gay automatons we hear about. Pretty much did turn out to be a motherfuckin’ Centrist robot.
“Anyhow we ran off, hell, he didn’t know what to do. We come back here fast, ‘bout run his rented horse to death, out of shape stable nag. After we got here, he talked to someone, or just thought it over. I don’t know, but something changed his tune, maybe just paranoid. He walked into the bar, real serious like, asked me to come out and see something. Old line, should have been suspicious. Especially when he led me out the back door into the alley.
“He had a helper, shot me as I came out the door, never saw who it was.”
“How do you know they were working together?”
“Didn’t shoot Soames. So it seemed that way.”
Charley says, “Times up, the man’s tired, too much talking,” and ushers us out.
I stop in the doorway and turn back. “You rest now partner, we’ll leave ya to sleep.”
“One more thing,” says Michael. “Saw his rifle, a .50 caliber.”
“Aha,” says Spud.
We head out.
“So, no constables, marshalls?” I ask.
“Nope, solved it,” Wolf says.
“How?”
Wolf gestures toward his brother.
“Spud?”
“Yep.”
I’m baffled. But Wolf says no more.
We leave Charley’s and head back to the main street. Spud leads us down to the Sheriff’s Office which is empty. As we walk in Spud swings around behind the desk, opens a drawer, gets out a badge, pins it on his shirt and says, “May I help you fine citizens?”
“You?”
Sir Jacob covers his smile with a hand, Wolf laughs outright.
“We are experiencing a shortage of officials.” Spud leans back in the chair looking smug.
“But the sheriff arrested us last visit. What happened to him?”
“That were Deputy Dave. He ain’t bad.”
“Doesn’t Center send law dogs?”
“Word gets around, new transfers usually defect to our side or leave once they hear the stories of their predecessor’s ends. Nowadays word has been whispered back to the Proxima Pi Outpost, they never come at all. Defect onto a more hospitable planet. Hell, not many are suited to live in our god forsaken wilderness, thank the gods,” says Spud.
“So now we elect from our own. Still, seems the last guy was playin’ it loose and easy with the rules. Caught shootin’ at our lady cowpuncher. He was the guy you shot dead the other day,” says Wolf. “Spud has been appointed an interim official ‘til we get a new election organized.”
“Oh, great, I shot the sheriff,” I say.
“Not to worry, Wolf witness, self-defense. Sheriff Spud believe Wolf.”
“Still, yikes.” I’m mulling it over. A fed. I have mental pictures of orange coveralls and leg irons. Breaking rocks on an asteroid. No men.
“Yep, Sheriff Spud. Got a ring to it. We figured out that if we elected our own sheriff and informed the regional Chief that he would be happy to leave us alone,” says Wolf.
“Marshall Mullens to you, boy.”
“I thought you was the Sheriff.”
“I is, but Tindall painted my official sign wrong.” he pulls a name placard out of a drawer, it says ‘Marshall Mullens’.
“Nice promotion,” says Wolf.
I look at Spud and ask, “Job involve a lot of paperwork?”
“Shore, Proxima Pi asks for reports. I told them I don’t trust the mails, airwaves or underlings, but they are welcome to come pick it up in person.” Spud jerks his head. “Maybe that roadblock is them. Searching for paperwork.”
I smile. “Uh huh.”
“‘Yes sir’ will suffice. And if yore nice, I’ll show you my star.”
“Lord have mercy.” I laugh.
I look closer. “Badge says sheriff, not marshall.”
“Careful. We arrest people for readin’.”
Spud spins his chair around, takes off the badge, and says, “I’m undercover.”
“Um, in civies?”
“No.” Spud holds his arms wide and says, “I’m me,” then he holds badge to chest. “Now I’m undercover.”
“He is infiltrating the Centrists, or thinks he is,” says Sir Jacob.
“I am the titular man in authority here.”
“Here in MadDog?” I ask.
“Here on the Rock, I am the ‘Big Kahuna’, as they say on Hawaiia.”
“Which explains why when people disappear, no one investigates.”
“Indeed,” agrees Sir Jacob. “While titularly Sheriff Spud or Marshall Mullens, I should say, is law enforcement, he chooses to not, in fact, enforce.”
“But there is a higher authority who oversees his position?”
“Ah. yes, that would be myself; Sir Jacob Bridbury, Duke of Barkingham, Earl of Boyd, Heir to the Flemish fortune and to Quimby Castle at Bridbury, first cousin to His Royal Majesty King Arthur II, Counsel to the Duke of Beltingham, Brother to the Pontiff of Laxham, Friend to the Court of Palanca, descended from the Neanderthal. Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to The Planet Rock. No one else wanted to be. Your servant, Madam.” He bows and sweeps an arm. “Very much at your service.”
“I had to ask.”
Sir Jacob says, “I, however, have never seen a need to investigate. Our eminent Sheriff, or Marshall as the sign says, is a fine, trustworthy and dedicated man. A credit to his planet.”
“Ah, I see. I think.”
“I believe that government can be a place where the people can get together and no one gets left behind. If I arrest people and jail them they come out and repeat their offenses. I leave folks be. If they have differences they settle them. It ain’t perfect, but it costs nothing, and some of them what gets killed deserve it. Them that don’t get killed, they get a second chance. Sometimes a third,” says Spud.
Sir Jacob takes up the narrative, “Fourth chance or first, if the offense is capital, we give them a 24 hour head start or whatever is appropriate.
“In fact, what we have is a volunteer Sheriff. No taxes, thus no public monies. So crime control like volunteer fire control is voluntary. Similar to the miners committees of the Gold Rush Era on Old Earth, people get together and vote on laws, elect representatives to the Committee. The Council is commanded to keep the laws for the people. Should a crime need investigating or a criminal need caught, anyone can pick up the badge, raise a volunteer posse. Then they go out and do the job. Criminals are exiled to punitive planets. The most definitive solution is to publicize that if they leave this planet, we won’t go after them. Easy peasy.
“Galaxies of space, outer space that is, for everyone. Let murderers move to the planet of murderers, their own people, so to speak.
“All else fails we place them on a ship ourselves, to a new colony, like they did on Earth in the good ole Hollywood days. Ship ‘em off, give them a new start. They cease to be our problem. Maybe they are tough enough and raw enough to take a new world and all its inherent problems. Colonizing an empty planet is hard work. Persons who are busy staying alive haven’t time to get in trouble.
“In fact, I believe troublemakers have the perfect temperament for danger. They thrive on it. New worlds full of giant predators and disastrous weather bring out the best in them. Why, some write back and thank us after. For them, hell beats prison.
“Frontier justice works best when folks are few and far between. We can only hope that this policy makes us an instrument of good.”
“‘Course if we cain’t scare ‘em away,” adds Spud, “or drug and throw them on a ship headed off planet, and they manage to get word to Proxima Pi for help, we got to ‘deal with’ the Centrist guys who come to check on things. First law of survival.”
Lone sets us back on course saying, “So, about that roadblock.”
“Yeah and why are we gettin’ shot at ever’where we go?” I ask, then think on it. 
“I remember,” I continue, a mite confused. “Michael told me he thought it was the sheriff who shot him.”
“No, Spud’s the sheriff. He can’t have been the…” says Sir Jacob.
Spud grunts, “Hold on.” he ponders a bit, scratching his head. Finally he looks at me and gets a wide eyed expression on his face, like a light bulb just turned on. Crap, he remembers.
“Hey, Bob, you said something early this morning that I just realized was maybe not just a smartass remark and might be important. How ‘bout you tell us all, then we can decide if it has some relation to all the bullets that seem to just miss you.”
I gulp and straighten my gun belt. “Which thing?”
“That thrice accused, twice falsely deal?”
“Oh, I said that out loud?” Oops.
“Yep.”
I think back. Crap, I did. “Damn it.”
“That’s it.”
“That was long ago and far away.”
“I say, Miss Annie, the universe gets smaller every day. May be best if you unload, we are all friends here, none above a transgression if warranted.”
“Yeah, but.”
“Oh, shit.”
Wolf raises a hand.
“Company.” Sir Jacob, who is nearest the door, holds a finger to his lips then pulls his hat down over his eyes.
Spud pins on the Marshall’s badge and sits up. Wolf grabs my arm and says, “Out the back.”
He and I head through a doorway into the cells. We can hear someone opening the front door, so we move over against the wall, next to the cell door. Even in my Bob disguise, no sense takin’ chances. And Wolf? Oh hell, all Injuns might look alike to Soames, bein’ a city dude, but you never know. Wolf points at a spyhole behind us. I take advantage and spy.
As Soames steps into the sheriff’s office, he looks around, spots the star on Spud’s chest.
“Ah, Marshall may be you can assist me. I am…” Soames looks around at Sir Jacob.
“We were just finishing up here. Thank you, citizen,” says Spud dismissively to Sir Jacob.
Sir Jacob mumbles something unintelligible and leaves.
“I am Superintendent Soames from Proxima Pi. I need to send a report of my activities to the nearest Centrist Outpost.”
Spud says, “I can carry the message for you. I am headed to the Intergalactic Frontier Planet Law Enforcement Convention there at Proxima Pi tomorrow.”
“Actually,” Soames says, “if you have the room, could I ride along? Have you noticed, there does seem to be a bit of desperado activity hereabouts?”
“Oh?” asks Spud. “Anything the Marshall’s Office can help with?”
“No. Thank you. I have things under control now. Just need a ride.”
“We leave tomorrow an hour after first light. Dock A on the S.S. Shitkicker.”
“Quite the name.”
“Call me sentimental.”
Soames looks confused. “Thank you, sir. See you in the morning.”
After a few minutes I walk back in, appalled. “You let him walk out? That’s the guy. As far as he knows, he killed Michael. Well, had him killed or at least abandoned him to die. Why the fuck didn’t you arrest him? It was at the very least attempted homicide. He was an accomplice.”
“He isn’t the guy. His accomplice is the guy. We arrest him, he likely won’t talk. We need to get them both, get one to testify against the other. Trust me, I’m the experienced lawman here,” says Spud.
I am trembling with adrenaline. “Shit, fuck, okay, we also need to find out what the treasure is that they are searching for so vigorously.” My blood is up. “Michael is my compadre, partner, hell, my brother, through thick and thin.”
Sir Jacob, who has also returned, grips my shoulder.
“We understand your kinship, but we must remain calm Annie, er, Bob. We need at least one of them to spill their guts, at least figuratively, before we spill their actual guts.”
“He leaves tomorrow, we’re nowhere.”
“We can’t be nowhere, because to be, we have to be somewhere. Not possible to be nowhere,” says Wolf as he grips my other shoulder in empathy. “Not worry, Spud smart for white man. Almost as smart as his brother, Wolf.”
Sir Jacob, Wolf and I head toward the Short Branch.
I stop before we get to the door of the cantina and say, “You guys go ahead. I got a thing.”
“I will reconnoiter,” says Sir Jacob. He heads into the bar. Wolf stands just outside the door. Sir Jacob looks around and waves to Wolf. “Come in friend, I shall treat you to a finely aged libation, a tribute to the Spirits.”
Wolf gives me an adios nod and heads in. I head to the Granite Grand Hotel. It has a ways to go to live up to its grandiose name but it does have a back stairway. The back door is easy to find, I head up the maids’ route. Charley has done the spy work; Soames is staying in the only suite.
I go into his room to look for clues to unravel the code to the maps. “Crap. Motherfucker.” I reach up and pull off the fake mustache, which is itchy and annoying as hell and stuff it in my shirt pocket. Pretty soon I take off my coat and vest too. Someone has stoked the heater stove way up into the stratosphere. Or maybe I am just nervous.
“Balls.”
My search is interrupted by Soames’ arrival. I hear his footsteps in the hall, so I grab my shed clothing and tiptoe for the window but, damn, some sucker is walking across the portico roof. I turn and slip into the closet. Shit. It is dark. I peek out between the hanging clothes.
Soames comes in and crosses to the window and whispers, “All clear, Brady. Come.”
From the scraping and grunting sounds I’d say it’s a tight squeeze. Sure enough, a dumpy potbellied fellow clambers in.
“We wanted him alive,” says Soames.
“Ah, he didn’t know nothing, better off without the greaser bastard,” answers Brady.
“You dumbass. He likely had money hid somewhere. You think we don’t need money?”
“Shit, he weren’t nothin’ but a con artist. I could smell it. Anyhow no matter, he’s kilt.”
 “Yeah, great. The Super is out of our hair too, Jones was a pain in the ass. ‘The book, the book, do it by the book.’ Never get rich that way. They should promote me now.”
“Yep, Jonny, you sure kilt him dead.”
Soames nods. “Yes, good riddance, I say.”
“Good news. I went to the sheriff’s this afternoon and he is totally unaware, never batted an eye. Dumb bastard is giving me a ride to Pi tomorrow. I can find out anything he knows. Stupid bumpkin, he is.”
“Yeah, this planet, buncha hicks in Hicksville.”
“You lay low while I’m gone, Brady.”
“Nobody saw us, we got away with it. Scot free. Relax Jonny.”
“I mean it, stay in your crib, best if no one sees you.”
“Sure, see on the turnaround, Soames.”
“You keep your head down tonight, too. Stay out of trouble. I’ll leave first, you go out the window in five.”
Soames heads out the door.
“Superior asshole,” mumbles Brady to his departing back. He sticks his head out the window to leave.
“Grrr.”
“Hey, what’s that? Crazy dog. What the fuck?”
He pulls his head back in and draws his gun as Bitch jumps in the window and grabs his wrist. His hand relaxes reflexively from the pressure and he drops the revolver.
Brady struggles and grabs for the cane leaning against the night stand. He hits Bitch hard across the ear with it. She staggers and loses her grip.
Brady pulls away, grunts and reaches for the gun with his left hand. “Bullet will fix you, mutt,” he says.
“Wait.” I step out of the closet.
He turns the gun on me. His eyes widen.
He growls, “The niece? I really don’t need you, bitch.”
“She’s the Bitch.”
“What? Hey, quit fuckin’ with me.” Brady gestures me back with the little pistol.
I raise my hands. “Don’t shoot, I don’t have a gun.”
“That makes it easy, stand still,” says Brady. “Soames will have a tie in here, stinking Centrist cunt think he’s superior. Once you’re trussed up we will both go visit the sheriff.”
“Bastard.”
He backs over to the side of the bed and fumbles into Soames’ suitcase, keeping a weather eye on me.
I fidget.
“Hold still, damn it.”
Not feeling what he needs in the suitcase, he glances down.
‘Thwack.’
Brady clasps his ribcage and falls to the floor.
“Oh, forgot to mention, I did have a knife.” I carefully nudge him with the toe of my boot. Nothing.
“‘Never bring a knife to a gunfight? Idiots.”
I grab Soames’ cane and poke at Brady’s eyeball, no reaction.
“Think we’re good here,” I say to Bitch.
Bitch and I head out the window. With luck, no one has seen us. I actually remember to retrieve and wipe my knife, too. Genius.
Revenge? Sweet.

34  Shinin’ Times


Next morning, as Spud and I are dressing, Wolf walks in.
“Hey, I might’ve been in an embarrassing state.”
“Wolf hoping so.”
“What’s up brother?” asks Spud, smiling.
“Trent find dead body in Soames’ room last night.”
“Trent?” I ask.
“Hotel clerk,” offers Spud.
“Him hear noise. Go look.”
“Soames?”
“No, other guy.”
“I better investigate,” says Spud.
“You can start here,” I say.
They both look at me.
“I was there, in the closet. Soames admitted to killing Headless, Supervisor Jones was his name. I heard it all. The dead guy is named Brady. He shot Michael, said so himself.”
“What, why?”
“That’s all I got.”
“I shouldn’t ask more?”
“That’s the important part. Solved two crimes. They do believe Michael is dead.”
“Okay, should I ask how you got in the closet?”
“I went up to search his room for evidence, Soames came in through the door, then Brady came in the window, closet was my only choice.”
“Soames killed Brady?” Spud asks.
“Near enough.”
Spud looks quizzical. “Okay, I won’t ask.”
Wolf nods and adds, “Like Annie say, not important.”
“Yep,” Spud nods to himself. “I gotta hit the road, scheduled for takeoff. No time for more.”
“Adios, darlin’.” Spud embraces me, leans me over almost to the ground and delivers a giant smoocheroo. “Wolf will keep you happy.”
Wolf looks at me with, well, a wolfish grin and a gleam in his eye.
“I feel like dinner,” I say.
They look at each other and both guffaw.
“Seriously, I’m nervous.”
“Not to worry darlin’, Wolf is a pussy cat.”
“Wolves and cats both eat people.”
Spud grins more and waves as he heads for the Shitkicker. He has Soames and somehow also the roadblock crew to keep him company.
Spud and ‘friends’ rocket off to the proverbial stars; actually it’s just a couple day hop to nearby Proxima Pi. Oh, yeah, proxima means nearby, in case yore Latin is rusty.
“We must be off,” says Sir Jacob. “We’ve a meeting with Sir Steven.”
I borrow Charley’s boudoir to shed the mustache, unbind my tits and dress back up as myself. After the visit to the recently dead/resurrected Michael, some weapon cleaning and then way too much time in the dry goods store shopping for supplies, I develop a world class thirst.
“I am allergic to this shit. You boys finish yore shoppin’, I’ll go warm a bar stool.”
“Girls! No staying power,” says Sir Jacob. “I say Annie, I shall be a gentleman and accompany you. Come, Wolf, let us adjourn to talk and drink as men...”
“And women,” I, being uppity, must add.
“…do,” finishes Sir Jacob.
We head down the street and I go first into the saloon, brassy and bold, just like I am walking onto a starship.
A big man standing at other end of bar, yells drunkenly, “Hey! Ma bitch! Come ova’ here, lemme pet yore soft, beautiful hair!”
I pull leather, he raises his hands slowly. “Wait, not...”
“Apologize, now!”
“I’se apologize, missy, this brother were talkin’ ‘bout the bitch.”
“Enough!” I wiggle the barrel of my.45 at him.
“Um, Annie...” Wolf whispers.
“Busy here.”
“That ain’t a polite term for a lady, motherfucker.”
“No Ma’am, but...”
“Annie,” repeats Wolf.
“Still busy.”
“Yes ‘mm.”
“But, nothing. Apologize!”
Wolf says, “But Mose is talking about...”
“No matter, Miss. I apologize. Don’t shoot, just let me walk over. I’ll shake her paw, too.”
“Paw?”
“Annie!” Charley yells. “Put your gun down, Mose is talking to the Bitch.”
“What?”
“The dog, Annie. She is standing behind you. Please relax now. Holster your weapon.”
“Where did she come from?”
“She her own bitch, go whea she want.” Mose, who is carrying a long scoped buffalo gun in one hand, walks over and kneels down to pet the dog. “I’se mighty sorry Bitch, she maybe don’ know yore name. Here, you shake.”
Bitch raises her paw, Mose shakes it and gives her a big hug.
I turn five shades of red. “Oh.”
“Mose, all that bowing and scraping is just confusing Annie. She’s a bit simple minded.”
“Hey!”
“It’s awright, lotta women scared of a big black buck like mysef.”
“Annie, I’ll thank you to refrain from shooting my close friends,” Sir Jacobs adds his two cents worth. “This is Sir Steven Hawkins, as we call him. Steven, this is Annie Talks To Horses.”
Sir Steven tips his hat and says, “Pleasure to make yore acquaintance, Miss Annie. I am Stevenson Moses Hawkins, the one and only black man on the Rock, but not the only African. You know we humans all started out in Africa, on that Planet they called Earth. In what they egotistically called America, ignoring all the other countries in the Americas. Slavery was their sin and Injins were their shame. Heard of it?”
“Dare say I have, seems to be a popular story on the Rock. Sorry about being so trigger happy.”
“S’okay. I heard the women’s liberation stories. I suppose y’all girls are people, too. Us men do kinda need you for the procreation stuff.”
I start to bristle again.
Wolf, Jacob and Mose start laughing.
 “That was priceless! Bitch,” says Sir Jacob.
“Shit, you set me up? Bastards.”
“Here darlin’,” says Wolf. “Have a drink, you were cute as a bug.”
“Not sure I like yore friends.”
They all chuckle, yeesh.
Mose says, “Join me at my table back in the corner there, we can talk. I will buy you a drink, Annie, for the trouble I have caused. Pray you will believe that it was these two crazy bastards’ idea. Hope you don’t take offense, no bad med’cine intended. And you might’s well call me Mose, everyone but Sir Jakey here does.”
We head back with a bottle and glasses and settle around the table.
Mose raises a glass. “To shinin’ times.” 
He looks at Wolf. “Speakin’ of Med’cine, Wolf. I got news for y’all. I saw the Spirit Buffalo last week. That what you lookin’ fer? It were somthin’, brother, a fine sight to see. White as the fallen snow.”
Wolf’s eyes gleam.
I ask, “What is a Spirit Animal?”
Wolf explains, “Very rare white phase animal, seldom seen. They have much power.”
“Well hell, Michael saw a white deer out by No Name Peak maybe three weeks back whilst hunting cows. Thought maybe he were hallucinatin’.”
Wolf is excited. “Spirit Deer,” he says reverently. “Bitch, buffalo, and deer.” Wolf looks ecstatic.
“Do all species have white animals?”
“Very rare in wild. White only blend in in snow, rest of year easy target for predator, especially after dark. Smart animal like weasel, ptarmigan, arctic fox change color with season. Most animal not.”
“Spirit bear, wolf, owl, eagle? So all are possible?”
“Mm.” Wolf turns his head. “Mose, where you see Buff?”
“Out chere whea the Three Forks meet. One of a big bunch, hundreds. Travelin’ south a course, in front of the weather.”
“Wolf go. Annie help Wolf find white deer, Mose show Wolf white buffalo. We must leave soon, weather get worse now. Wolf go on Spirit Quest. Friends guide and help.”
“You don’t need me Wolf, you know that country betta than I. I got my supplies mostly bought fer trappin’ season, so we can travel together to my Three Forks cabin, we’ll have Spirit smoke and feast. You and Annie go south from there. Buff cut a wide swath. Yore Spirit will guide you.”
Mose stands up. “Time’s a wastin’. Wolf, you got good solid horses to trade me? I need another animal for the winter.”
“Yes, bring two new ones today.” as Mose and Wolf head out to horse trade, Wolf looks back and says, “Meet Charley’s later, talk to Michael.”
I look at Sir Jacob. “Just like that, a Spirit Quest?”
Sir Jacob explains, “Yes, winter waits for no man and the white animals are short lived. Time is of the essence. Once the snow sticks they will be harder to spot and of course travel will be impeded. With luck the weather will hold while you make a quick trip.
“Wolf knows whereof he speaks. White animals are rare in nature it is believed that this is because they stand out from the background in all but snow white areas, thus are more open to predation, as he opined. The scientific theory results from the fact that when animals are bred in captivity the numbers of white animals increase dramatically.
“He takes the Spirits seriously and amazingly has asked you to accompany him. It is an opportunity I have not known him to offer to any who are not of his family.”
Wolf comes back to the table.
“But, why me?” I ask.
“True that Injin and Paleface came from same place before time,” says Wolf. “Africa. But Injins better.”
I laugh. “And?”
“Annie Injin, Wolf Injin, good medicine come if we go. Circle of life, Spirit Animals, white man not understand.”
“Ay yi yi Wolf, yore givin’ me a headache. Maybe I ain’t Injin.”
Wolf says, “Annie already have Injin name and white Spirit Bitch. What more could you need?”
“But you gave me the name.”
“Spirits speak thru Wolf.” He walks out. Inscrutable.
Sir Jacob and I head over to Charley’s. She is staying home with Michael until he is stabilized. Wolf joins us there and grills Michael until Charley kicks us out.
 “Michael needs rest.”
Back in Charley’s kitchen, I am still unconvinced.
“Wolf, I didn’t see the white deer, Michael did. Why am I going?”
“Michael need rest, heal. Michael tell Annie where him see deer. Wolf charged with Annie safety by brother. Wolf not let you out of sight. We not know, maybe shooters aiming for you. Spud say, Wolf agree. Maybe Annie learn something. You ever go Spirit Quest?”
“Well, no. But I have things...”
“Okay, Wolf decide. Hands free or hogtied, Annie go, bring good luck with Spirits. Spirits speak.”
“Why now, when winter is nigh? Why not in spring when the weather is warming?” I ask.
Wolf says solemnly, “Because now is now and later is illusion.”
Sir Jacob and Charley laugh.
“Apologies Wolf, not a laughing matter, but Annie looks like she thinks she still has a choice,” says Sir Jacob.
Charley looks at me and asks, “100 years from now when you are looking back at your life, don’t you want to be able to say you had the guts to go on a Quest?” She pats my hand. “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of Michael. I have known Wolf all his life. He speaks for the Spirits and they have always proven well worth a listen, and Sir Jacob, I’ll wager, will help Coati with the livestock should the weather close in.”
Crack of dawn next morning Mose, Wolf and I set out with the pack string loaded with Mose’s winter possibles and our camp. Bitch has moved up to a position right behind Spike and I. She looks as serious and committed to the Quest as Wolf.
Michael stays in MadDog to recuperate. He and Charley promise to stay alert, watching for the arrival of any more Centrist paper pushers.
Sky will act as liaison between them and us Spirit Seekers.
As I ride past a big bush Wolf rides out, grabs me and plants a big kiss on my lips.
“Wolf wait,” I say as he plants another one. I push him away. “Spud is trusting you to take care of me.”
“In fact Spud said for me to keep you happy. That I am doing.”
“No. I’m sure he means just protect me and such.”
“A brother keeps his woman well-bred and fed during his brother’s absence. It is the way of our tribe.”
“Has anyone told Spud?”
“Of course, he doesn’t want you to get horny and wander. My job is to take care of that.”
“Oh.” I feel the blood in my cheeks.
Wolf says, “Injin ways are not white ways, you have much to learn, Annie Talks To Horses.”
We ride along for hours up the trail through a deciduous forest rampant with fall color then we break out on top of a cliff overlooking another vast plain.
We pause to look at the wonder the Rock has spread out before us.
 “The gods smile on us, Annie.”
“But if you had a wife and Spud left town?” I am still chewing on the same bone.
“Yes, Little One, I would still bed you also. It is a brother’s duty. Should Spud die, I would marry you, were you his wife. Or if I had a wife already, I would then have two wives and all the children to care for, proudly. No one would be left alone or hungry.”
“Okay. Say I marry Spud and you are also married.”
“Yes?”
“If I die, would your wife marry Spud?”
“Yes, as I say no one should be left alone or hungry.”
“But what if I don’t want to?”
“Not marry me? I am Lone Wolf? All ladies want me. And many men also.”
“Seriously.”
“No,” he says and grins. “It is Annie choice.”
“And?”
“And Spud choice if things are the other way around.”
I ponder this a bit. “Children? Marriage? I ain’t ready. Holy cow! I ain’t ready to even think about...”
Wolf interrupts, “Annie Talks To Horses, you have wandered from my thought.”
“Thought?”
“Open your eyes. We are here now. Relax. Be here now. Trust in the future, should tomorrow even come.”
I think, but my mind is blank. 
“Wait.” I think back. “You mentioned my eyes.”
“Open them. Look.”
I look out at the valley. The prairie grasses and flowers have tall seed heads waving in the wind and the trees along the creek are cloaked in fall colors. The creek is rolling and tumbling along.
“Oh, my gods, yes,”  I say. “This world, this Rock.”
“Yes,” says Wolf, “all we can see, it is ours. The gods are smiling on us.”
