My dear friend, the real truth always sounds impossible, do you know that? To make truth sound believable you must always mix a lie with it. People have always done so
- Dostoevsky 

The vaunted eloquence of statistics has all the futility of precision without force…the printed page of the Press makes a still sort of uproar, taking from men both the power to reflect and the faculty of genuine feeling: leaving them with only the artificially created need to have something exciting to talk about.
- Conrad
Chapter One

The boy followed the path without thinking about anything in particular. It was late afternoon; almost evening. Mist hung in droplets as the air chilled, softening the autumn colours of the hills. The day was very still. The only sound he heard was the light rustle of his own clothing as he walked.
Earlier in the day, the fells had been busy with hikers and ramblers. Now they were gone; some to fill the crowded tea shops and pubs, while others hurried home to beat the evening traffic. Now the boy felt as if the country was his alone; the deserted path, the still air, and the light that shone through the soft mist with such peculiar clarity as to make it seem to glow. 
At first, he’d only intended to catch the last of the sunshine on the high path that overlooked their rented cottage. His father had warned him about walking the hills alone. The old man was annoyed because the boy had refused to join the rest of the family on the hike he had so carefully planned. His son preferred to spend the day alone, sitting in the warm kitchen, idly leafing through the pages of a borrowed book that was as dull as his thoughts; turning the pages mechanically, his attention wandering.
At last the boy could enjoy the outdoors in solitude, letting his feet lead him, with neither map nor compass to spoil the mood. Already he’d travelled a good distance from the cottage. His father liked to pretend that the fells could be threatening, but the boy knew that in fact this was a tamed country. Even in its remote places the paths were so well trodden that you could hardly miss your way if you tried. 
Soon, the path became steeper and rockier, but the boy was young and some long denied part of him welcomed the effort of climbing. Without being aware of it, he was standing straighter. His hunched over shuffle unconsciously lengthened to an easy stride. He had no clear destination in mind but he knew that the path he was following led to a summit somewhere. It couldn’t be far away, and there was still plenty of daylight left. His uncle had warned him that high on the tops, the route tended to be a bit of a scramble: he looked forward to it. He was glad he was wearing trainers rather than the stupid heavy boots that his father had made the rest of them wear. 
As he continued to climb, the air cooled and the October sun could no longer sustain the ripening droplets of moisture that were hanging in the air. An improbable rain began to shimmer faintly in the light of an almost cloudless sky. 
Soon, the landscape became a little darker and its colours more muted. The boy enjoyed the freshening breeze and the feeling of the rain on his face. This was weather that suited his mood more than the time-stopped noontime he had dozed through back at the cottage. He could admit that the scene was pretty enough, in a lifeless way, but its charm was not to his taste. A country landscape painted in discreet oils: dappled sunlight through trees with pretty shading emerald to russet. In the foreground a few dumb cows, chewing cud with patient stupidity and treading the paddock to bog. His father had described the scene as bucolic. He didn’t know what that word meant, but in his mind it hinted at something sickly, which seemed to him appropriate 
This brooding, and overcast sky of early evening on the empty fells was better than the cottage; more vital. At least here you could actually feel as if life was happening.
The thought of what his father and uncle would say if they could see him now made him smile; out on his own and without what they would call suitable clothing.  Maybe it was true that the mountain wasn’t quite safe. You couldn’t see so far into the hazy distance now as you could have minutes earlier. Fair enough, you’d be in trouble, say if you had a fall, and weren’t able to walk. But falls were for old people. And besides, even with the damp now penetrating his sweater, the day was warm enough. The summit must be close: to turn back without seeing it would seem like failure at this stage.
Although, as it turned out, the summit was further away than he had thought. Eventually he arrived where he thought it must be, but by now there was nothing to be seen at all for more than a few yards in any direction. The fog was a blanket, and the cold was biting. He was a little empty and deflated as he stood there, feeling as if he should leave something behind to mark his visit; simply retracing his steps was not adequate to the moment. But then, as if for the first time, he realised how close the night time was.
He needed to get back down as quickly as possible. He knew that there was a downward path that was shorter than the way he had climbed, but in truth, it wasn’t easy to pick out any path across the exposed rock of the summit. Even so, he thought he could pretty clearly make out where the line of it should be. 
The weather was freezing now. His clothes were soaked through, and there were big drops of moisture coating his sweater. He felt the first pricks of barbed anxiety that had been hiding in a corner of his mind; but not too sharp, for the moment.
Quickly, he sighted the more direct route and started down the track. Without the exertion of climbing to warm him, he soon felt cold seeping into his body. He tried to speed up to compensate, but then realised that in this light, if he started to jog, he would stand a good chance of twisting an ankle or worse. The wind seemed much stronger now. It was surprising that there could there be so much wind and mist at the same time. It seemed that the rain and the air had merged into one.
 The atmosphere was heavy with water. His hair was plastered to his scalp and he could feel himself becoming tired: more tired than he should be only from walking. He had to make a conscious effort to maintain his pace. The light was fading more quickly than he had expected. He knew that the others would be home by now, wondering where he’d gone. He allowed himself to admit that he was scared, just a little, hoping that by allowing himself a small rational degree of anxiety he might keep that growing sense of vague dread at bay. It didn’t seem to work that way though.
The path he was following had started out clear and well trodden, but now it was all but exhausted. There was no more than a sheep trail to follow. In places where the land was boggy, the track seemed to sink into the earth. Each time, after he lost it, he believed that he had been able to recover the path a little further along, but with each vanishing he became less sure of his way. This was such confusing terrain that even the sense of heading downhill could not be trusted. The path followed the contours of the landscape, up as well as down, and seemed in no hurry to get anywhere. 
Finally, the track disappeared entirely and he was abandoned in a broad hollow of boggy peat, his feet sinking into the ooze between the marsh grasses. The boy reasoned that if he followed a straight course, then on the far side of the bog he should emerge on or near the path. But how to know which way was straight?
The marshland tried its best to suck him in. On the far side, he emerged from the bog with his shoes coated inside and out with liquid slime.  He climbed a steep bank only to find his way blocked by a stone wall. Following the line of the wall, first one way and then the other, he found no gate or stile. That couldn’t be a path, but he must climb the wall, or retrace his steps. 

Over the wall he went; but on the other side, still no path. And now the night was truly come. The land became indistinct and featureless as the pale remains of the day surrendered to the darkness. 
The child within him urged him to sit down and wait for the adults to make things right. Some other voice insisted that he keep moving, even if the way forward was not clear. His teeth were chattering uncontrollably and his body was shaking. His thin sweater was heavy with the rain soaked into it. All he could think was that he must find a path, any path, off the mountain. 
He climbed another wall. The stones felt hard and sharp on his numb fingers. On the other side, he found himself between two high stone walls, on a rough track, unmade but broad enough for horses to have passed in the olden days. He set off in what felt like the downward direction, arms hugging his shoulders tightly and jaw clenched against the shivering cold.
The new path continued for some distance. There was not much that he could see beyond the walls, in the almost perfect blackness. Then it seemed that there was some kind of building ahead. It must be empty, he thought. No-one would live up here, so far from any road, but at least there might be a roof and somewhere to rest for a while. 
By the time he came to the building, fatigue had almost overwhelmed him. He knew that he could go no further: still he felt embarrassment. How should he explain himself to the owner of the cottage, if there was one? But when he reached the building and it became clear that the old place had been abandoned for many years, his disappointment was more bitter than shame could have been. He felt as if the last of his strength had been used up, practically falling against the door. 
The wood was damp and almost rotted. There was no lock, and it was easy to push the door ajar, but to enter, he had to force the narrow opening with his shoulder. The timbers scraped across the floor, sagging pitifully in a frame that was close to collapse. Screws fell out of the rusted hinges. He could smell the animals that had sheltered there before him. The boy sank onto the uneven stone and in a second felt even colder than when he’d been outside. At least here it was fairly dry. He half crawled into a dark corner. There was nothing to be seen, inside or out. He curled his body into the tightest ball he could make and tried to collect his thoughts. 
He must not stay in this place too long, but he could allow himself a minute or two: a short rest while he thought about what to do next. 
When he awoke, it was the same cottage, but everything had changed. Most important, he was warm and dry. There was a fire burning in the grate, the roof was somehow entire, and the empty window frames had been glazed. The light of a fire and soft candle glow illumined the space. The boy found himself dressed warmly, in a style of clothing he did not recognize. He saw that his own clothes were drying near the fire: they looked odd and out of place in this setting. 
The sense of fear, even desperation, which had taken hold of him earlier, had vanished, and it was as if those emotions and that life belonged to someone else. Instead, he felt safe and calm.
The cottage was nothing but a single room, and there was a figure, back turned to him, performing some kind of household task at the far end. He could tell that the stranger was female, although as she turned and advanced to the table that stood between them, her face was hidden in the shadows. He could only see distinctly her hands, setting a bowl on the table, and steam rising from the bowl. 
Try some, she said in a voice that was very tender; a voice he knew. He realized that he was very hungry.
The boy struggled to his feet and staggered towards the table. He felt so weak. A place was already set for him. Then she smiled and he saw her face, and it was his mother: his mother who had been dead for almost two years. But this did not trouble him just at that moment; it seemed right and comfortable. His concern was that he needed to eat, and to rest some more. 
When the boy awoke again it was after midnight. He was alone in the decaying cottage that once more reeked of animal droppings; lying in the dark on the stone floor. Through the holes in the partly collapsed roof he could see moonlight and the glow of stars. The night air had cleared. The rain and the fog seemed like a false memory. He was wearing his own clothes, but they were dry, and his body still felt the warmth of a fire and the satisfaction of a hot dinner. 
For some reason all of this seemed perfectly natural to him, and his thoughts turned to practical matters.
He pushed the ruined door aside and stumbled out of the cottage; then he scaled the wall on the far side of the track. As he stood on top of the wall, in the moonlight he could make out the line that the path followed ahead. It wound down the hill between double walls of high rough stone. He did not know where he was right now, but the route he must follow was clear enough. 
The boy set off down the path, which now seemed to descend with some purpose. His spirits rose gradually, until he found that he was even enjoying the empty serenity of the night. Soon he spotted the distant lights of a settlement not far below him. 
For a time, the boy was in dread of what he would have to say when he finally reached whatever village this might be. How to explain his stupidity to a stranger, let alone anything else that had happened? But then somehow or other, as he descended, the unknown path that he was travelling joined with and crossed other paths, that seemed more familiar, until eventually, without knowing quite where he had been, he knew where he was. It was the village where they were staying, and now he could even make out their cottage, at the far edge of the hill.
For a moment he paused, realizing that there would be no end of trouble at the end of this night, but there was nothing to be done. 
When he first arrived, only his aunt remained in the house. The others were out looking for him, though they returned quickly enough. At first, the only mood in the house was relief, but soon enough that gave way to anger and recrimination; and of course his father was the most angry. The boy could not say anything to explain himself. His only defence was to plead, truthfully, that he was exhausted. Eventually, his aunt insisted that they allow him a hot bath and then sleep.
There were more questions and harsh words in the following days. Still the boy had no answers for his father, and still he said nothing about the time in the derelict cottage: not to his aunt or his father or anyone else. It was almost a relief for the boy when he found that he’d caught a serious chill; exposure his aunt called it. Finally, he was able to claim the privilege of an invalid to be left in relative peace.
The boy was strong enough and before the end of the holiday he’d recovered well enough to be up and about. He spent his time looking for a way back to the cottage, but he could never find it, nor even a path that fit his memory of that night. 
As the years passed he returned to the valley more than once, alone or with friends. Always he would find time to search for his hidden cottage and always his search would be in vain.
The man who had been that boy eventually told some members of the family his story, but in a joking, light-hearted way as if he didn’t believe it had all really happened. That tone didn’t match his true memory though. All families have their minor histories and myths; tales that don’t demand literal belief to take their place in the shared discourse; and so the boy’s experience passed as unremarkable. 
Strangely, the story was never once told to the father, and perhaps that was a good thing. The old man would not have been much impressed. He was a practical man; skilled with his hands and holding a serious regard for the plain truth. There was not much room in his view of the world for fanciful nonsense. The father and son were very different in their natures. They both grieved deeply for the lost wife and mother, but each grieved in his own way and their sorrow did not bring them closer. 
Growing older, a continuing reticence about sharing his secrets with his own family did not prevent the young man from telling the story to relative strangers; at dinner parties or over drinks with friends. The tale was told so many times that it changed in the telling. Perhaps details were exaggerated or lost, or layers of meaning became polished away. Memory is always shifting, and the one who remembers is blind to the changes. What stayed constant always was the boy’s firm belief that this story was true and that it in a way that had yet to be defined it would shape the man he was to become. 
In those later years, a friend, who had heard the story more than once and might have been tired of it, asked the man to explain its point. Was the storyteller suggesting that he believed in ghosts? The man only answered that he had to believe what he had seen and felt, and what he remembered. For him, it was inarguable that something extraordinary had happened in his life, and whatever it was had saved him.
The friend wasn’t sure what the explanation meant, or if it was intended to mean anything. The man would often say things that were puzzling or infuriating when you thought about them afterwards, even though he spoke with such confident charm that at the time every word seemed reasonable. Perhaps he simply enjoyed being enigmatic. He loved telling stories of all kinds and he never seemed to be without a circle of willing listeners. 
The friend came to believe that, for the man, what was important about this story, or at least, what had become important to him, was not so much the supernatural part, which he seemed to take for granted, as the notion that he had been chosen to be saved. He had been the beneficiary of an intervention that was so extraordinary, so far from the everyday, that it must have happened for an important reason. Whatever the truth was about what happened on the hill, that night, all those years ago, the undeniable outcome was that the boy passed on to his adult self a rare and terrible thing; the sense that he had been chosen for a purpose and carried a destiny to be fulfilled.

Tim Price stirred unwillingly, conscious that most of the morning was already gone, but unwilling to confront the remainder of it. It must be close to midday, he thought, judging by the light. The bed creaked as he moved; the springs were exhausted and uneven. 
He was alone. Good.
He closed his eyes again and listened for movement elsewhere in the house. There was none. He guessed there would be someone sleeping on the couch. There always was. Probably someone else on the floor too. 
All things considered, he didn´t feel too bad. At least he’d made it to bed. He had undressed at least partly; and taken his shoes off. Also he´d remembered to take out his contact lenses. The inside of his mouth was coated with something disgusting, though. He wondered if he’d been smoking again.
The best thing would be to lie still and wait for David to get up, or better still Matthew. Once Matthew was up he would start to clean up the mess, in spite of himself. Then later he’d complain like a girl that no one had helped him. Anyway Matthew and David could deal with any guests and then Tim wouldn´t need to talk to anyone. Afterwards maybe he could persuade one of them to go to the Uni bar with him. A stale pie and a pint of beer would be the best cure for this head, and for the horrible taste in his mouth.
He raised himself on his elbows and moved his head, experimentally, from side to side. Until you started to move about, you never knew how bad it was.
Quite bad. 
He still couldn’t hear any sounds in the house, but now his bladder was demanding relief. Perhaps he could get to the toilet and back without disturbing anyone. Maybe sneak a mug of tea as well. 
Thank god the girl wasn´t here with him. What was her name? The girl would have been a mistake. It wasn´t so much that Tim was still supposed to be going out with Sue, his sixth form sweetheart. She was in Lancaster, wherever that was, studying computing. Both he and Sue knew, or at least Tim assumed they did, though nothing had been said, that their relationship wasn’t serious anymore. 
No, it hadn’t been because of Sue at all; it was the girl herself. Good looking, but you could tell in a minute that she would be a nightmare. High maintenance; takes everything too seriously; get´s too involved too quickly. Written all over her face. Unusual for a posh girl to be the type that wants to get serious, but maybe she wasn´t as posh as she seemed. Though she had that voice all right.
Anyway she was gone and just as well. He didn´t know what David had been thinking of, trying to set them up with each other. He’d been going on about her before the party and supposedly he’d been telling her how well she would get on with Tim. She was from David´s faculty, reading law. She seemed to take that seriously too, unlike David. That should have been enough for him to know: Tim liked girls who enjoyed having a laugh, not the ones who spent their days in the library. It had been stupid for David to drag her out here to meet Tim. Waste of time for both of them. 
Now he was on his feet, putting on whatever clothes were to hand. The house was always cold, even in the spring. He felt dizzy, and weak, as if he was recovering from having been poisoned; which of course he was. The sensation was strangely pleasant. Tim knew that feeling like this; he would be content to do nothing for most of the rest of the day. If only someone else would clean up the mess from last night.
Whoever was on or in the sofa stayed buried under a duvet as he passed. On the floor there was a turntable and an amplifier, and the remains of a shelf that had detached itself from the wall at around three in the morning, spilling the equipment and a pile of records. The shelving was cheap do-it-yourself aluminium and chipboard. Clearly whoever had done it themselves had made a poor job of it. The lower part of the upright section was still attached to the wall. The upper part bent inwards with screws hanging uselessly in the plastic plugs that had fallen away, leaving worryingly large holes in the wall plaster. There were small piles of plaster dust on the floor soaking up the spilled beer in the carpet. 
Tim supposed that the landlord would not be happy, but just now it was more interesting to ponder why shelves which sat in place for months without shifting should suddenly give way at three in the morning. There wasn’t any more weight on them than before, but they had been playing music at high volume for what, eight hours? Maybe it was the vibration of the bass that had caused it: the power of music.
The house reeked of old beer and cigarettes. How did the smell of beer become stale so quickly? Everything was a mystery to him this morning. Empty cans topped with cigarette ash and half empty glasses with butts floating in them. Bits of food on the carpet. Had they ordered pizza? When? Tim passed as quickly and as silently as he could into the kitchen. 
Patricia was already there: that was her name, he remembered now. Okay, no problem: don´t let on you can´t remember anything, just go with the flow and she´s bound to give you some clues. Looks good in that long T-shirt, nice legs. Bare feet not such a good idea in this kitchen though. Bit sticky underfoot.
-Hi.
-Hi you.
That´s no good. Give me a bit more to work with. How about, did we sleep together last night and if so did I enjoy it? Sounds like a simple enough question. 
-Tea? I´m already making.
-Yes. Thanks.
The kettle was taking a long time to boil and he felt that maybe he should say something. At least she had smiled at him, but that could mean anything. Now she was busying herself with the mugs and spoons. He hoped that she wasn´t paying too much attention to how clean they were. Three mugs. She handed him one, then removed the tea bags from the other two, squeezing them dry against the spoon. 
-See you later.
She smiled again and was on her way.
To David´s room. Sly bastard, so that was it. 

***

David Thomas was the boy who had been lost on the hill. Almost five years had passed. Now, it was the end of the nineteen seventies. He and two friends were sharing a rented house in the north of the city, close to the University. 
The house was part of a terrace in one of many rows of identical terraces that spread across that part of town; all of them old and unloved, coated with the grime of years and sagging resigned and weary under the weight of neglect. 
This particular dwelling had been too many years let to students. It had large sash windows with frames that had worn loose to the point that the draft which blew in when the wind gusted made them rattle. There was a little space at the front of the house, behind a low wall, where weeds grew up through cracked concrete. The only other growing thing visible from the outside of the property was the hybrid of grass and damp moss that seemed to flourish in the ancient wooden guttering. Rainwater flowing into the gutter down the brittle cracked roof tiles was absorbed rather than draining away. Other, indeterminate forms of wetness percolate into the interior.
The inside walls were almost completely dry most of the time, but discoloured here and there by the dark efflorescence of some organic matter that seemed to bloom in random locations. In the living room, there was a gas fire set in the hearth. The flame of it heated three studded plates made of some grey substance (they hoped it wasn’t asbestos) until the plates glowed pink and gave a cosy warmth, but only if you were within three feet of the fire. Otherwise it would at least provide an illusion of heat. In their bedrooms, each of the tenants kept a plug in fan heater, brought from home to add noise and expense to their lives. Common areas like kitchen and toilet were not to be entered without appropriate layers of clothing during the winter months. The bath was best avoided throughout the year.
Their landlord, Peter, may have lived in the house as a student, many years ago. Now he claimed to be a lecturer in something or other, though not at the university. He was one of those prematurely aged, but never quite grown up characters that you saw hanging around the student areas, still going to the same bars and wearing the same clothes, as if they had never graduated (which perhaps they had not). In his own mind at least, Peter had opted to join the counter culture. He wouldn’t have been able to explain precisely what that meant, but he was fond of saying that money was not important. He couldn’t understand why his tenants should become so infuriated when they discovered the various ways he’d found to make a little more of it by skimping on maintenance or making little extra charges on top of the rent. 
After the party, Peter never said much about the damage to the wall, but then he didn’t take any steps to arrange a repair either, so in the end the missing plaster became just another scar left behind to mark their occupation. There were plenty of other ones. 
A few months on, at least the house was warmer. And it was the final term of the year. In the late morning. David and Matthew were in the front room, arguing, when Tim came in from the shops.
-Shift up; let me get near the fire.
-Shouldn´t need a fire at this time of year.
-You wouldn´t if you were outside. It´s warmer out there than in here.
-What have you got in that bag Tim?
Tim only smiled and held the bag up. It appeared there was something heavy and bottle shaped inside.
-What are you two arguing about?
They were going on about university clubs and societies, more specifically the drama group, which was David’s latest enthusiasm and which he was trying to persuade Matthew to join.
-I told him, no way, don´t even think about it. 
-But it´s all about literature. That´s your thing. 
Matthew had already heard this line of argument and he was clearly not impressed.
-Literature doesn’t come into it.  What it´s really about are some over-confident arseholes who like dressing up and making a noise, failing to remember speeches that they haven’t understood in the first place. That´s not my thing at all thank you.
Tim thought it might help if he intervened.
-You know David is only interested in plays because he wants to spend more time with Patricia. You could just go along to be a mate.
-If that’s his only reason then I don’t see why he needs me there at all It´s not like he´s the shy and retiring type. You know how he is. Turns up any place and a few weeks later they’re all David this and David that. You’ve joined just about every society going already. I think drama is the only one you’ve missed.
-At this time in our life we’re supposed to be trying different things, David answered him. It´s a good way to meet people.
-I don’t want to meet people. I don’t approve of people. And you never stick at any of these clubs for more than a few weeks. How is that any good for meeting anyone?
-Better than you think. The ones I need to know remember me and I never forget anyone. Anyway with this club it’s different.
Matthew snorted
-Like when you persuaded me to join the climbing club, even though I´m afraid of heights. That was going to be different too. You told me it would be an opportunity for me to conquer my phobias, only it wasn’t. I discovered that I didn’t have a phobia, just a rational fear of falling and breaking my neck.
-You wouldn´t have to do anything frightening in the theatre group. You wouldn’t even need to be on stage. They fight one another for the acting roles. You’d just have to, you know, help out.
-Sounds fascinating, but I still don´t do clubs and societies. I´m not the type.
Tim was enjoying Matthew´s discomfort. He broke in again.
-That´s not true you know David. I can tell you Matthew’s been through every political society on they have; but never for more than a week or two. He’s no better than you in that way. He couldn´t decide whether he´s a socialist worker or a revolutionary worker. Then he realized that he wasn´t a worker at all and neither were any of the others, so I think he decided to be a Fabian.
-You have no idea what a Fabian is.
-No but it sounds a bit queer doesn´t it? I suppose they´re poofters who dress to the left. 
Matthew threw up his hands in disgust, but David was not finished. Matthew argued that it was not as if Patricia was actually any good at acting. She said herself that she was struggling to be competent. She only attempted the minor roles. In other words she had no talent; and she didn´t seem to enjoy it, so what was the point? 
By now David was thinking that perhaps he should have had this conversation with Matt before dragging him to attend one of the drama group’s productions. He replied that Patricia was set on being a barrister, making speeches in courtrooms and the like. That was just the same as acting. She’d decided she needed to develop the skill and she was determined enough to persevere even if it didn’t come naturally to her. That took a lot of courage and they should admire her for it. He was beginning to sound pompous again. 
Matthew nodded. 
-What about you David, don´t you need to be able to act?
-Barristers act. I’m not going to be that kind of lawyer. You need family connections to get on at the bar, and even then there’s no money in it for years.
-Besides which, you don´t actually like law, added Tim.
-And there’s that, David confessed. He grinned at Tim. But I´ve been thinking about your telling me that I have no vocation.
Tim looked puzzled.
-You mean like a holiday? I don’t remember saying anything about it.
-You idiot. Stop pretending to be stupid or you’ll end up not needing to. You remember very well telling me I was generally good at everything, and not specifically good for anything. You said with that kind of brain, I ought to do well in business.
-I was taking the piss.
-I know, but still I’ve been thinking it might be true. In any case, law or business, that’s just the start. I’m going to do something that people will notice before I’m finished. I’ve been thinking about music possibly.
Tim laughed.
-We’ve heard your guitar playing, I should think again.
-Not playing. I mean developing talent, promotions. The management side.
Matthew spoke, returning to what, for him, was a familiar theme.
-You need connections to do anything in this world apart from teaching or working in an office. That´s one thing you soon learn. All those years I spent at school feeling isolated because I was too clever. I didn´t fit in with the boys who went off to work in factories or learn trades. They´ve got cars and houses now, families some of them. I thought, at least at uni I´ll meet people like myself. I mean, it´s not like we were at Oxford or Cambridge, is it? I never even put in for those places; I knew I shouldn’t fit in. But it turns out that even at the vulgar redbrick University of Leeds it´s still all what school were you at and what do your people do. I hate it.
-Give it a rest Matthew; Tim sank onto the battered sofa, as if exhausted. Don’t you get sick of playing that record?
But David looked serious for a moment.
-You might try to make connections with some of those people you complain about, as long as you are here anyway, he said. They aren´t all bad you know.
-I don´t want to know them, Can´t you understand? As it is I can feel myself changing; becoming more like them. I even pretend to understand references they make to things that they all know about and ordinary people like me don’t. I spent years at home pretending to be more stupid than I was, thinking there’d be a world here where I might belong. And now I’m here, I’m still spending my time playing at being someone I’m not and hoping to fit in.
-Don´t worry about it, Tim said. David and I are low born scum, just like you. And if what you say is right you should be great at acting. You´re doing it already.
-Eventually it won´t even be acting, Matthew replied. We´ll be absorbed into their world, allotted some little corner of it to sit quietly in, provided we play the game; which we will of course. We´ll play the game even more than those who really do belong in that world, with all their smug sense of entitlement. They don’t have any doubts, but we´ll be trying to make ourselves invisible like the Jews and the gays in Europe in the thirties, more conformist than anyone else; living in terror in case our abnormality should be discovered.
-You can stay in your corner if you like, said David firmly. I´m going to do something with my life.
Tim had heard enough. It was more of the same old crap the two of them were always talking about.
-Stop it, both of you, he said. Let´s examine the contents of my magic bag. Look, a pint of milk, bread, some margarine. I know it´s horrible but it´s cheap. And behold, new and unopened, a bottle of port. Could be vintage, look at the dust.
-Who drinks port?
-We do now. If we sip it we can make it last until the Uni bar gets going and then we start the evening with a buzz at next to no cost. 
David fetched the cleanest looking of the glasses and Tim poured a measure for each of them. 
-It´s sweet.
-Tastes shit, Tim agreed.
-But still.
Tim eased back in his chair, smiling.
-Tell us David, what´s so special about Patricia that you follow her around. Tall, charismatic, handsome lad like you. It´s not as if you were lacking female attention. If it was Matt, I could understand it. I mean with him it would be desperation.
-You´re no oil painting yourself, Tim.
-Fair point, but still. Tell us David.
Patricia is the girl I am going to marry
-What? Tim and Matthew exploded in unison.
-You haven´t even started to play the field yet, said Tim. Think of all the sex you’ll miss. And you hardly know the girl.
-How can you make a commitment now, said Matthew, when there´s so much of your life ahead? You make a promise that the two of you will change in the same way, and that you’ll always have a meaningful relationship – that’s nonsense. You don’t know who you’ll be a few years from now.
David was unperturbed.
-It only seems strange to you two, because you haven´t got your lives organized. But I’ve told you before, I expect to do something with my life, even if I don´t know exactly what just yet, and Patricia fits, she´s perfect. We´re perfect together. 
-It’s you who doesn’t get it Matthew, he continued; when can you make a commitment in life if not now when all the changes are ahead of you? Do you plan to stop changing at some point? Say you wait till you’re thirty five, then how would you find someone who feels the same way as you do about life, when you’ve lived half of it without even knowing them? 
David seemed so sure of himself that it was accepted that the subject was beyond discussion. He explained that he really needed Matthew´s help with the club, because he had no idea what all the talk about plays and authors and techniques meant, and even if he was fairly sure that most of the rest of them knew no more than him, he could not risk showing himself up in front of Patricia.
-And I may have given her the impression that I’m a bit of an expert, he admitted.
Matthew resisted only a little longer before agreeing to help. He was disarmed by David’s candour, but anyway, he´d known from the start that he would eventually give in to his friend. Didn’t he always? Tim declared that they should toast the new adventure. The taking of port before serious drinking commenced was a fine tradition that he intended to establish starting now. Matthew sipped his drink and eyed Tim suspiciously.
-You haven´t paid for this booze have you?
-I cannot tell a lie.
-I wish that were true. Where did you get it?
-From the off licence
-You´ve been shoplifting, from Mr Singh.
-Don´t get angry. I know you would rather I stole from the supermarkets, who can afford it, but the fact is it´s not so easy to get past their checkout system.
-I´d rather you didn´t steal at all.
Tim shrugged his shoulders.
-It´s a bad habit. From my misspent youth. I am trying to give it up. No one is without sin though eh? I mean we all did a bit of it when we were kids, didn´t we?
-No, we most certainly didn´t. Did you David?
David looked slightly sheepish.
-Only once or twice, just small stuff, just for the dare, he admitted.
-You of all people Tim, Matthew persisted. You´re supposed to be a junior officer. The army is supporting your degree. What would they think if you were caught? What would happen to you?
-I don´t give a monkey´s about the army, but I´m not going to get caught. You have to have risk in your life to live it, Matthew. When are you going to realize? What is it that you object to, that it´s wrong, or that I might get caught?
-That it´s wrong, of course. 
-So, don´t you want yours? Give that glass here then.

***

In the final term of his second year at university, Ali Abbas Patel was not sleeping well. He hadn’t any reason to be concerned about his grades; the reason was nothing so obvious as that. He felt as if there must be some energy within him that was not being used, but there seemed no logical reason why that should be the case. He studied hard. He went out for long walks alone, to relax from study and ponder his future. Nevertheless, even after the longest walks, he’d find that if he was lucky enough to drift off shortly after his ten o’clock bedtime, he’d be awake a few hours later, knowing that there was no chance of any more sleep before morning. 
Ali Abbas was renting a single room in a part of town not far from the university. Each morning, in the early hours, he’d be waiting as a dismal light started to penetrate the thin curtains. Within a few minutes the drapes would seem translucent with the unattractive yellow glow that gradually seeped into the grey darkness of the tiny room. 
He’d already been awake for hours. Not long after four thirty, to the accompanying sound of an electric milk float rattling past and the staccato carillon of empty bottles being jolted in metal crates, he would abandon thoughts of sleep. When the dawn came, he’d be sitting quietly next to the window, sipping weak tea and reading; pausing frequently to polish the thick lenses of his black rimmed reading glasses.
Really this was the only time of day when the light in his room was any good. It was tempting to compare this meagre glow to the brilliant sunlight they’d enjoyed at home, but that would have been false sentimentality. The truth was that home was a fading memory; and maybe his family had been wrong ever to call it home. 
He lifted a corner of the curtain, the better to observe the pale light of the day that was leaking into the world. The morning was dry and it seemed as if any gasp of a breeze had died out in the empty alley. Litter and dead leaves lay in a mingled heap without so much as a rustle. He had no idea where the leaves could have come from. 
The view from his window was of a back alley that was partly obscured by the high brick walls of the terrace yards. This house had no wall, and beyond what he would have called the garden, he could glimpse a roughly cobbled section of street. Dustbins that the neighbours had put out for collection the previous night were stationed like iron sentinels along the alley. 
To Ali Abbas, the dustbins were unfamiliar and strange; galvanized cylinders with the sides pressed into corrugations, capped with heavy lids of metal or vinyl that were jammed hard down on the contents or balanced precariously on the rubbish of overfilled bins. Once a week a council vehicle squeezed down the alley in the early morning and the rough men, cheerful and boisterous, collected the bins and emptied their contents into the wagon or onto the street, making a great show of hoisting the heavy receptacles onto their shoulders, and ensuring that a robust banging and scraping of iron was heard down the terraces as they made their progress. 
Ali Abbas had seen nothing quite like it before arriving in this country. Like so much else that was strange to him about England, there was a ritualistic aspect to the refuse collection that he found strangely comforting. It was regular and orderly, clumsy and inefficient, but always the same. You could see that bins had been emptied in that same way for a long time. The process belonged to a style of living where things happened as you expected. 
This society was organized around shared routines, as his previous life had been. He could still remember it, though not so clearly now. Curiously it was the far away times, when he’d been very small, that left the most impression. Then at least, the sense of routine had been strong, in the days before the trouble started. He remembered sitting with an aunt in one of his father’s stores, playing and watching the customers come and go, listening to their conversation and absorbing the slow rhythm of the day that was the same as every other day. He couldn’t remember that he’d ever been troubled by uncertainty in those days.
But that was long ago and he told himself that he did not much miss the past. It was only that now his life was very different. It was time for him to prepare breakfast, though he was not feeling the least bit hungry. A cup of tea was enough. The aunts were always telling his mother that she should get him to eat more: he was too thin. But Ali Abbas did not have time to be interested in food (and maybe the aunts were too much interested in food if it came to that). There were so many other claims on his thoughts. 
For example, the problem of the lectures troubled him. If he was honest, Ali Abbas was dismayed that so many of his fellow students seemed to regard lectures as worth attending only if they had nothing more interesting to do, such as sleeping. He reminded himself that it was different for the others. Their parents had not needed to make sacrifices. In England, everyone was entitled to study for a degree, provided only that they appeared to be clever enough. That had never been the case in Uganda and certainly once the troubles started, education had been as hard to get as everything else. 
Before that time, his parents had been well-off, maybe even rich, though none of them had realized it. His mother had servants around the house. He remembered overhearing snatches of family conversation that he hadn’t understood at the time were his father urging her to be discreet about the domestic help. 
When they had to leave home and come to England, everything they had was left behind, but even so they had been happy for a while; relieved to escape the African madness and grateful that the home country had honoured the promise stamped on their British passports (his father had never doubted it). They counted themselves lucky; everyone knew stories about other families who had not been so fortunate. 
But relief only buoys the spirits for so long and afterwards they started to reflect on all that was lost. For a young boy with only vague memories looking back and a life ahead of him, the loss was not so serious, but these days there was a nervous edge to his mother’s voice, and a tired anxiety in the lines around his father’s eyes that made him seem older than his years. 
In what he said, father clung tightly to the fatalistic optimism that is part of the stock in trade of small merchants everywhere; men who are constantly at the mercy of events that are bigger than they are, that they cannot hope to influence or even fully understand. But Ali Abbas had noticed that on certain days, for no reason that he could discover, his father’s hands would start to tremble, involuntarily, as if his grip was failing. Of course, father had started in business again and things were not going so badly now, but it seemed that he could not free himself from the fear that at any moment, everything he had worked for could be snatched away from him once more. 
At university, Ali Abbas noticed that most of the students did not have much contact with home. In fact they never seemed to talk about their families, let alone speak with them. There was a strange form of egoism all around, that he couldn’t quite comprehend, as if all the students were completely absorbed by the question of who they were, or who they wanted to be, and had no time for anything else. Ali Abbas phoned home every other night. Usually he spoke to his mother and father and one or both of the sisters. It was hard to imagine a life where you didn’t feel the need to keep in touch like that. 
Comparing his life to the other students made him embarrassed with himself. He pictured himself hurrying to a phone box to make the call at the allotted hour. Maybe he was making himself ridiculous, but then he reminded himself of what they always told each other at home; that nothing was more important than family. He couldn’t help how he felt though; he wasn’t exactly ashamed about ringing home all the time, but it did make him feel not quite adult. 
And the monotony of those dialogues, where neither party had anything new to say, sometimes left him feeling desperate. He argued with himself about that too. It doesn’t matter so much what we say as that we speak. And monotony is calming; it can be a comfort; but not when it’s that grinding dullness that leaves you wanting to scream. In any case, it was too late to stage a revolt against the calls now. He should have said something in the first weeks of his first term. Now the routine was fixed; if he missed a day or two, his mother would drag father up here to find him. She’d insist that some kind of tragedy must have struck him. The image of his mother turning up at the lecture theatre was a painful one; it was the way his daydreams turned, more and more frequently, when he thought about home
He felt guilty about that. Remember, that the family is who you are, he told himself often. It has given you everything, not just the opportunity to learn, but the motivation. This is why you have to understand big events like the one that uprooted us. Perhaps one day you could even have a part in the big events. 
For Ali Abbas, politics and economics were of more than academic interest: they were levers that he’d seen were long enough to move the world on its axis. One day he hoped to play some part in the movement. He wasn’t sure how just yet. But now he had let his tea go cold and it was time to go to lectures. No breakfast again today.

***

It was another of those morning lectures that seemed to have too many empty seats. Steve Kirk, one of the few students who Ali Abbas knew well enough to have an occasional conversation with, complained that most of the lecturers just re-hashed what was written in the recommended books, without any comment or insight (and sometimes without apparent understanding, Ali Abbas was too polite to add). Why bother going to a lecture, Steve would say, where the lecturer is even more bored than the students; when you could read the same information in bed or at the library? 
This line of argument disturbed Ali Abbas, partly because he found it difficult to disagree with. He wanted to insist that Steve was missing the point of what it was to be at the university, but as usual he could not find the words to express his argument. And the rest of what he wanted to say about personal responsibility sounded ridiculously pompous even to himself. 
In any case Stephen was not here and Ali Abbas was left to ponder what benefit he might gain by sitting through today’s turgid recitation. The speaker was clumsily summarising ideas that he had found vital and even exciting when reading the original text, but which seemed more and more flat and commonplace the longer this lecture droned on.
Afterwards, one of the girls; he couldn’t remember her name, asked if she could borrow his notes of the lecture from the previous week. She explained something about having been away at a party that had unexpectedly taken up three days. Not for the first time, Ali Abbas was glad that he never drank. It was obvious that the girl was suffering from a hangover even now and she had probably only dragged herself to the lecture in hopes of begging notes from someone like him. Although he wanted to help the girl, he was nervous as to when he might get his own papers back. 
-You could probably manage without them, he told her. Everything that the professor said is in chapters four, seven and eight of the textbook. I can give you the references now if you like. The ideas are actually explained more clearly in the book
-But I’d have to read the book then love. And it’s such a thick one, I wouldn’t know where to start. Go on be a darling. Thanks.
He carefully explained when and why he needed the file back as a matter of urgency. The girl nodded in agreement, but he could see that she wasn’t listening. Ali Abbas handed over the notes, with misgivings. The girl thanked him and quickly disappeared with her friends. 
At eleven he visited the refectory for a strong coffee, without milk or sugar, in accordance with his routine. It was his only coffee of the day; the indulgence he permitted himself before his tutorial and then afternoon in the library. 
While Ali Abbas was in the library, he found himself musing about his fellow students. He knew that everyone was aware that he knew the course material better than any of them; but he was also conscious that they thought him dull, maybe even stupid in a way that they had probably not bothered to define to themselves. He had all the facts, but in tutorials he offered few opinions of his own. When the other students said things that they imagined were original, he naturally related them to ideas that had been expressed more elegantly in the books and commentaries he had already read. The consequence was that everyone decided that he had nothing fresh to say for himself. 
Even his tutors seemed to be afflicted by this ignorance of all that had already been said. Everyone was so determined to be original that they preferred not to know if anyone else had been there first.
He, on the other hand, did not understand why they should place so much importance on what they called expressing themselves. He didn’t want to be unkind, but it was boring when they went on about subjects which it was clear they had not studied in enough depth to have a valid opinion about. What they expressed, badly, was an articulation of what others had said or written earlier and with greater perceptiveness and style. 
Ali Abbas couldn’t understand how his colleagues hoped to express something new before they had mastered the subject. But when he suggested as much to Steve Kirk, Stephen laughed at him and told him that sometimes you had to be an ignorant savage to be creative. Why was everyone so willing to believe this, he wondered? Was it just an excuse for laziness, or was he missing something? 
And he didn’t want to tell his parents how little his course mates applied themselves to their studies. At first, neither parent would understand him; and then if they did, they would worry about whether his course or his college was a bad one. Ali Abbas had seen enough not to believe that other universities were any different to this one. And since the apathy he saw all around was a problem that he had not resolved to his own satisfaction, there was no way to discuss it with his family.
He had to be equally reticent about his social situation. His mother imagined that because he was a good student he must have lots of friends. If he were to confess that he often felt like a social outcast, she might think he was lying about his grades. All he could tell them at home was the same old news; that he was doing well in class, getting high marks, and that there were some nice people on the course. 
Tonight, once more he would trudge from his room to the familiar red phone box that was always missing a few panes of glass and always felt cold whatever the season. He would try to ignore the smell of urine as he puzzled over the incomprehensible letters and designs that were scratched into every painted surface of the box, like the frenzied etchings of some lost tribe. In winter it was freezing, but now that the nights were lighter it was worse in some ways. He felt as if he was on show; and it was worse when there was a queue for the phone. 
When his turn came, he would pause, jiggling the coins in his pocket, making sure there were enough, and preparing himself to lift the dreaded receiver. It was like not being able to start to pee when there was someone else in the toilets.
Finally, he would make the call: the same evasions and half truths every other night in response to his mother’s innocent enquiries. Worse than what he told her, he knew that he lied to himself about the crushing loneliness that he sometimes felt; pretending that it was the same for all of them and what everyone had to endure. He stayed smiling and friendly, even when days went past without his exchanging more than a few mumbled words with anyone. He could sustain the act because he had a plan and this part of his life was just a stage of it. But sometimes when he listened to the pathetic half truths that he told his mother about his life, it made keeping up the pretence that much harder.
He was shamed by the pathetic gratitude that he felt for the company of the few people he did know, ex-neighbours from his first year in the halls of residence, when everybody really had been on their own, not just him. He hoped that his current state was not too obvious and that the few who still kept in touch were not doing so out of pity. His dread of being pitied made it impossible for him to take the initiative. It was only when one of them briefly remembered his existence that he could respond and enjoy human contact for a while. 
How could he explain any of this to his family? He couldn’t say that he was shy. As far as they were concerned, he was still the chubby little boy, always smiling and ready to make his aunt’s customers burst out laughing with a cheeky comment or gesture. His mother only worried that now he was too thin. His father had no idea what to say on a telephone unless it was business. He always asked the same brief questions before passing the phone back to his mother. The girls only wanted to hear about the exciting lives they could look forward to having when it was their turn to be students. All their chatter was about parties and the kind of boys they might hope to meet. 
When it came to the time to make the call, he’d turned these thoughts over in his mind for so long that he was quite depressed. He’d have preferred to hurry back to his room, but he knew there was no way to avoid what must be done. Then he’d pick up the receiver as if it were a heavy weight and slowly begin to dial the number. 
Using the payphone was a prolonged and mechanical business. Ali Abbas knew that there were phones now where you only had to press one button for each number, but in this box you dialled the number on an actual dial. You pushed a finger into the hole in the dial that corresponded to the numeral you wanted and then wound it back against the spring until the number clicked. Then you had to release and wait for the spring to return the dial to its starting position before you could select the next digit. It was a process that could not be hurried, building a tense sense of expectation that grew until you were finally connected. And if the connection failed or the person you were calling didn’t answer, there’d be a real sense of failure as a result. 
Ali Abbas dialled four digits for a district code, then six digits for a local number. He listened to the phone ringing. Someone answered in a moment. The voice was instantly obliterated by a high pitched repeating tone that caused him to panic and fumble his change, however well he prepared for these few seconds that the exchange allowed him to feed coins into the payphone slot. 
-Abbas?
-Mamma, how is everyone?
-Your sister is going to a party with some friends. She’s upstairs getting ready with Ana. They’re very excited, giggling all the time, and the party is not till Friday. They will drive me crazy. What did you have to eat today? You’re hungry; I can hear it in your voice.
-Mamma, I’ve only said four words. I’m fine. How is father?
-He’s here. Wait a minute, I’ll put him on. 
-Father?
-Abbas. Hello.
-Are you well?
-Yes.
-What’s happening at home dad?
-Your mother is cooking all the day. Making me eat more and more food because she worries that you are too thin. Please put on some weight before you come home next time or I will be burst. Are you studying hard?
-Yes dad. I’m always studying hard.
-Are your grades good?
-Yes, I’m getting good marks.
-That’s good. I’ll pass you back to your mother then.
-Mamma?
-The girls are making new friends, Abby. I worry about you, so far from home.
-I make lots of friends. Everyone is away from their home, just like me, so it’s easy to meet interesting people. 
-Like who? It’s not good for you spending too much time talking about philosophy and politics with all these studious boys you speak to at the library. You need to talk to some girls as well. Ana has been telling me how the English girls have their own ideas and live their own lives. I’d love to meet one. 
-I talk to girls.
-When Abby?
-Well, today for example in the morning lecture. I was talking to this girl about what the professor said, and we arranged to meet and discuss it afterwards. 
-You be careful Abbas. Not so fast. These English girls are dangerous. They have their own ideas and they want to live their own lives. Oh, now I’m worried. Promise me you won’t get too involved with this girl.
-She’s just a friend Mamma.
When the call was finished, he collected the leftover change, feeling as if someone had been watching and laughing to him throughout the conversation. He pulled his plastic leather jacket tighter around his thin shoulders and pushed against the heavy door to make his escape from the booth. After these calls, he always took the long way back to his small flat, walking as slowly as he could.

These days, Patricia was round at the house all the time, but it wasn’t as bad as it sounded, having a constant female presence around. It seemed to make life calmer, although it was a bit of a pain having to pick soiled clothing off the floor and not eat directly out of tins if you were being watched. Tim’s energies were still directed to chasing the next good time, but he was something close to polite around Patricia: and in her company Matthew seemed not to be quite so weighed down by the oppressiveness of the world and all that was in it. David was positively happy. He looked at Patricia like she was some precious thing he had found. 
As for Patricia herself, well she seemed to relax a little in the shelter of David’s easy confidence and ready smile, even though she’d never be accused of being easy going.
They’d found a balance of sorts: it was only a little disturbed on the nights when David and Patricia went to bed for an early night or spent hours in the bath together. Matthew and Tim didn’t have girlfriends of their own. Tim joked that one girl was never going to be enough for him, while Matthew claimed that he was not ready for a relationship and did not want to be tied down. He told the other two that one half of a couple was one half of a person, though he took care not to say it in Patricia’s hearing. In Matthew’s opinion, freedom was more important than anything, even if sometimes he wondered if there wasn’t something he should be doing with his freedom. 
One night Matthew brought Carol home. Everyone seemed to be out, which was a relief; one reason being that he wasn’t yet sure whether or not Carol was pretty. He made some tea. They went up to his room to drink it. 
Carol was a music student he‘d met at the college film club of which he was a semi-clandestine member. They’d chatted for a while and she‘d been placidly agreeable to seeing his place, but now that she was here, Matthew was uncertain whether she had consented to anything more than a cup of tea. They sat side by side on his bed, separated by five inches of space and two mugs of Earl Grey tea that Matthew didn’t like much but at least you didn’t need milk for it. Minutes seemed to have passed already and he knew that he urgently needed to start a conversation. 
-Music then, second year. I suppose you like it a lot?
-Yes, it’s nice.
-I like music a lot, only most of what I like is what they call progressive, you know, King Crimson, Genesis. 
-I don’t know them.
-Well, everything’s punk rock now isn’t it? It’s the fashion. That’s all Tim will listen to. He doesn’t even want to know about David Bowie any more. 
-Oh, I don’t know about any of that.
-What music do you like to listen to?
-At the moment, I’m really passionate about Bartok. Do you know his work?
-Nothing comes to mind. But I like that kind of music too. I’ve got a Bach record somewhere downstairs. What else do you like besides music?
-Oh, you know, like I said, art and literature. Your posters are interesting.
-Yes, I just have three now. That one is called Sleep, it’s by Dali. I got it cheap from Athena, but I should have had it framed. The wall isn’t too dry and the bluetack has made the edges a little curled over.
-Well it’s sort of peaceful, although a bit disturbing to actually sleep under.
-I suppose. Actually I’ve had it for a while and now I think it’s rather vulgar and pretentious; almost juvenile really. I much prefer this one by Stanley Spencer. It’s called Swan Upping at Effingham and you can see they are collecting the swans in baskets from the river. Do you know Spencer?
-No
-You see how that the curve of the birds’ necks is repeated in the shape of the men’s arms?
-Oh yes it’s clever. And this?
-It’s called The Garden of Earthly Delights. It’s a detail of a painting by Hieronymus Bosch.
-I don’t like that one much. 
Christ we’ve been here five minutes, Matthew was thinking, and we’ve already killed off art and music, what next?
-Books then.
-I beg your pardon, Carol replied. Matthew could not remember that anyone had actually used the words I beg your pardon to him before.
-You said you liked literature. I wondered what books you’ve been reading lately.
-Oh, nothing really.
-Well what sort of books do you like to read?
-Anything I suppose. As long as it holds my interest. And I don’t like there to be politics in it. Too dull don’t you think? Matthew nodded his agreement. Other than that anything at all. 
-And film of course.
-What?
-You like films. Meeting you at the film club.
-Yes of course. Although that one tonight was a bit pretentious.
-I suppose it was. Matthew had thought that the whole point about film club films was that they should be pretentious. Did you see the one last week, he ventured?
-No, what was it about?
-I’m not sure really. It was in black and white of course. A very significant work. Very influential and very old. There were these French people on a barge travelling down a river. I suppose it would have been the Seine. Not much happened to be honest. 
-Was it interesting?
-Not really, no it was dull. Do you fancy going to the pub?

***

Two days after what Matthew remembered as the Carol debacle, he came home and found David and Patricia sitting on the couch with books open before them. He was about to leave them and go quietly to his room, but David greeted him warmly.
-There you are Matt, perfect. 
Patricia beamed at him.
-Thanks Matthew, it’s good of you to offer to help.
David noticed Matthew’s blank look and spoke to intercept any reply he might make.
-Like I said last night, Matt. The drama group: Pygmalion: Pat is going to be Clara. She’s been struggling a bit with it and I said we would help. You’re the expert of course, but I mean, it’s not such a straightforward part is it?
-It’s quite straightforward actually. Clara only has a few lines.
David smiled, relieved.
-So you’ve read it? I mean, yes good. 
But now Patricia was frowning.
-That’s partly the problem Matt. I have so little to say. God knows it’s not that I want to make the part bigger. I don’t suppose I could play Eliza if I practiced for a hundred years. But I want to do my little part well. It’s a matter of, how to get the character across with so few words. I mean, when you read the lines, she just sounds like a silly, snobbish girl who is desperate to be fashionable and catch a husband. But then I read the epilogue, and Shaw tells us that later on she becomes a progressive thinker. She meets H.G. Wells and everything. So there must be something more in her character that I should try to get across. 
She paused for a moment to allow him to consider the difficulty.
-And there’s just this one moment really, after Eliza’s accent slips, and because Eliza looks so beautiful and Higgins pretends that cockney is becoming fashionable, Clara, wants to imitate her. So I make this comment about Victorian prudery, and Higgins agrees, and then I am encouraged to make this comment “such bloody nonsense”, but it has to come out as shocking, because no proper lady would use such language then.
-Just say it with an affected upper class voice, as if you’re trying the word out for the first time.
-But then, Matt, it goes on. Let me read it, I say “Ha! Ha!” Well that’s not so easy to get right is it? And then it says “she goes out radiant, conscious of being thoroughly up to date, and is heard descending the stairs in a stream of silvery laughter”.  I ask you, how can I make that seem real?
Now Matthew was smiling.
-I really don’t believe it’s all that complicated, he replied. If I was you, I would learn the lines as well as you can, and just say them as if Clara was just a silly misguided girl with no substance. I’m positive that is all that Mr Shaw would expect of you. Clara is a stock character that his audience would recognize. It’s true that he undercuts the stereotype in the back story that follows on from the play, but that’s for the reader not for the theatre. Stories and plays; they’re different.  You know, Shaw would have written novels if he’d had the patience. That was his first ambition.
-So you think that really it’s just a trivial part, written to move the business of the drama along?
-Exactly, yes. Nothing to worry about at all.
He was so pleased at having easily cleared up Patricia’s little difficulty that he could not understand why David was staring daggers at him. 
-It’s based on a Greek myth you know, said David, sounding a little desperate, for some reason. Pygmalion was the statue brought to life by magic, like Eliza.
Matthew was happy to clear that up.
-Oh, no, Pygmalion is the name of the man who brings the statue to life, like Higgins.
-Ah.
-I’ll leave you to it then, now you’re sorted. Good luck with Clara, Pat.
Patricia gave him a look that did not seem quite as full of gratitude as he might have expected, but Matthew was oblivious to such subtleties.

When David’s father first heard from his son that he was planning to marry, he didn’t say too much. Inwardly his response was similar to what Matthew and Tim had told David. Mr Thomas had only met the girl three times. That he hardly knew her was not important, but knowing David and how he jumped at things, his father thought it probable that David didn’t know her that well either. 
Mr Thomas’s only comfort was to hear that, in spite of David regarding the matter as settled, he had not said anything about it to Patricia as yet. He did not see his son often and sometimes he believed that he did not know the boy at all. But not to know what was going through David’s mind at a time like this; that was just another worrying part of the business. 
It was not that Mr Thomas was against early marriages in general. David was not much younger than he’d been when he married David’s mother. But by then he’d been working for a few years and he knew a little bit about the world. David had done nothing yet and sometimes he acted like he’d not even begun to grow up. As for the girl, Mr Thomas thought he liked her well enough, from what little he’d seen, but there was something about her that made him doubtful so far as marriage was concerned. She was pretty and she seemed good natured, but you could see that she had some odd ideas. There was something under the surface that made him uneasy. 
For a start, they’d had not had Catholics in the family up to now, so far as he knew. He didn’t have anything against Catholics except that some of them seemed to take religion seriously. This girl wasn’t exactly churchy. According to David she hardly went to mass, though that could easily change over the years. Even now, she seemed to find little ways to let you know that faith meant something to her. 
He’d come across that sort before, even in people you only knew from work you’d see it. They seemed normal, then one little thing that an ordinary person wouldn’t even think about would turn out to hold all manner of superstitious importance for them. 
There would be complications about the ceremony and later about the children too, but the worst thing about people like that was that they changed as they got older. She might become devout, or worse, one of those women who obsessed about going to church every day and telling other people how they should live.
Mr Thomas senior thought of himself as a practical man. It was not that he was against religion, in its place. He would go to weddings, funerals and baptisms and remember to look serious in the right places; listening to all the nonsense that was spoken and looking at his shoes when he felt like laughing. Churches were alright for that; a bit of formality to the rites of passage, a little comfort for old people and others who couldn’t cope with the truth that once you were dead, it was the finish. 
But this Patricia of David’s, when she talked about “her faith” - well for a start, to use a phrase like that without blushing didn’t seem natural to him. In short, she sounded sincere about the whole business and that could only be dangerous.
But if I say anything against it, he told himself, that will only make David more set on the idea. 
He knew that the boy’s resentment of him had carried over from childhood. There were lots of reasons for it, he supposed, but he was painfully conscious that the loss of a mother was something that he had not been able to make up for, with his clumsy kindness, his common sense and he supposed his lack of imagination. 
I only hope he never starts to take all that god rubbish seriously himself, the father reflected. 
He might have been more worried if he had heard David arguing with Matthew about religion. David had taken to describing himself as an agnostic, which Matthew claimed meant he was more than halfway ready to give in to the god superstition. David denied that it was so. From time to time they discussed their respective positions in the earnest way of those who are young enough to believe that their opinions matter to anyone.
But just now they were at home. They‘d started to watch a game of football. It was supposed to be an important match. Important to who? Tim had demanded to know. He despised the game, and had left the house to avoid its taint. Patricia regarded football as an acceptable manifestation of the male need to spend time away from women: She didn’t consider it a threat and was content to feel harmlessly excluded. However, the game turned out to be so dull that even the TV commentator admitted to being bored. An exchange about cities with Catholic and Protestant football teams started them talking about religion generally. As usual, David was on the defensive.
-It’s not that I’m religious or a believer or anything like that. Of course I’m not. I’m just saying that if I were, I would have to agree with Patricia that the Catholic version is the only sensible form of Christianity. The other sorts make an appeal to reason you see; and obviously that’s nonsense. How can you believe based on logic?
-You can’t, but there’s a good reason why rational belief is not possible. That’s not an argument for irrational belief. Just because you might want to believe in something doesn’t make it any true. I’d rather cold reason to blind belief.
-Well suppose you are right, who knows? All I am saying is that you could only experience knowledge of god through faith, and faith is knowledge of the heart. And because of that, religion should be tied to beauty. It’s when you are moved by beauty that you have the awareness of spirituality, whether it’s from painting, or a piece of music; whatever. And at least the Catholics have a feeling for beauty, not like the Church of England. So grubby. Did I tell you about the time I went to Westminster Abbey? A thousand years of history and they have broken furniture lying around the corridors, and hand written posters for restoration appeals on the walls. There’s no aesthetic to it. It’s so mundane
-You mentioned it before. But please, don’t give me that guff about knowledge that’s not based on reason. I don’t know that feeling; but I’m sure it’s not knowledge. You shouldn’t trust it. And in any case you can’t help but see that all this beauty that has passed down the ages has come at a price. From where I stand, religion just looks like one more big business that the bosses run for their own benefit like any other. Seems that the Church believes that it’s fine to take money from the starving poor to buy gold plate for the altar or another painting for the bishop´s palace.
-My dad talks like that. He goes on about how the Church has kept the people down wherever it can; but he’s an engineer, a materialist. He only has one way to understand the world. He’s concerned himself all his life with knowing the exact measure of what he can touch. What can’t be touched doesn’t matter to him. To me, there’s a kind of poverty in allowing yourself such a narrow experience of life.
Matthew did not reply to that. Sometimes he thought there was no point arguing with David about anything. He had such certainty that you could never shake him, even when he was clearly wrong. There were ways in which David was even more exasperating than Tim. You’d get to thinking he was reasonable and that you understood him; and then every now and then he would show a glimpse of the inner self; a person driven by obsessions he didn’t understand himself. Didn’t want to understand most likely; given that he was so hungry to feel that some dark mystery guided his path. Matthew could see one truth about David that David couldn’t see for himself: he was a hopeless mystic. 
It wasn’t even funny. People’s lives were affected. Take this business with Patricia. David had got it into his head to get married, for no good reason that anyone could see; and now the wedding was going to happen. Matthew had no doubt about that, even if David had yet to inform Patricia of her fate. In Matthew’s experience, once David made up his mind to go after something, he would have it; whatever obstacles might lie in the way. And probably it will end badly for both of them, he thought. But then it was in Matthew’s nature to store up images of impending dread. 

***

As late spring began to hint at the coming of summer, the routines of David and his housemates were disrupted by an unusual invitation. 
From the start, it was clear that the party would be a special occasion. David had no scale to measure social events, but his invite was printed on a card which specified that he should wear a suit or dinner jacket. These facts spoke for themselves 
The occasion was to be the engagement of one of Patricia’s well heeled girlfriends. The family wanted to show off about it. They owned a big farm somewhere out in the Yorkshire countryside, and the celebration would take place in a giant marquee pitched in the grounds, with lighting and a temporary hard floor laid down for the occasion. More importantly, there would be a live band and free drink for the guests.
-They´ll need the floor to cover up the pig shit that’s lying there for the rest of the year, suggested Tim. 
He claimed to hate the countryside and country dwellers as much as he hated football fans. There’s nothing there, he said, but red-faced farty old men drooling into their flat beer, and various kinds of dumb animals crapping everywhere while they wait to be turned into meat.
-Nevertheless when he heard about the free beer, Tim consented to accept one of the additional tickets that had been allotted to David as the boyfriend of the bride to be’s best friend at college. His acceptance was a mixed blessing for David.
-But Tim, and I am serious now, you have to behave and not show us all up.
-Of course.
David was disappointed, even if not surprised, when Matthew claimed a prior engagement that he could not avoid.
-Don’t push him, there’s no point, said Tim.  You know how he’s allergic to toffs.
The arrangements would be that Patricia and some other girlfriends were spending the weekend at the farm, so the boys would need to make their own way there and back on the big night. The distance was not so great, but David was surprised when Tim offered to drive. 
-Not much point me spending my junior officer’s allowance to keep a car on the road if I never use it. In any case, if I drive I won’t drink, which should put your mind at rest. I think there‘ll be plenty to entertain me without booze. You never know, maybe me having my own wheels might turn the head of one of those buxom farmers’ lasses.
-She’ll need to be blind and daft as well as buxom to be impressed by your car, commented Matthew. 
-Always the negative comments Matt. Why don’t you change your mind and come with us? It will be fun.
-Four hours of standing around not knowing what it’s polite to say, while a local band murders creaky old rock and roll hits and some pimple who calls himself a DJ talks over crappy pop records.
-Yes, like I say, it will be fun. 
-No thanks.
The night before she left for the farm, Patricia asked David for a favour. 
-I wondered if you could pick up Abbas on the way, and bring him with you.
-Abbas who?
-Ali Abbas. You’ve seen him. We used to be in halls together in the first year. You know, the Asian boy.
-Oh you mean the funny little Indian kid. He’s coming to the party? I thought it was just going to be a select few.
-Well you know I got that ticket for Matthew. Only you mustn’t tell Abbas that. The poor boy hardly sees anyone. He never goes out and, well it was short notice. I didn’t know who else would come on their own and I can hardly give the ticket back. 
-So he accepted your invitation.
-Yes of course. I told him you would pick him up at seven thirty. You know David; one of the things I like about you is that you are so generous. Be a love and bring him along.

***

-He’d better be ready when we get there, said Tim.
-Don’t be mean, David replied. He’ll have been ready for the last half hour. Though he might change his mind when he sees us turn up in this thing.
David had thought that Tim was going to let them down. The time when they were supposed to leave passed and there was still no sign of him. Then at the last moment he turned up, explaining that his own car had broken down. By a stroke of good fortune, one of his fellow officer cadets had agreed to lend Tim his own car. It seemed to be their lucky night. They would arrive in a real car, not the one step away from the scrap yard wreck that was usually either parked outside the house or away somewhere being mended.
 -He must be crazy giving you the keys to this. What kind is it anyway?
-Ford Escort Mexico. Not many of them about. And I wouldn’t expect a civilian like you to understand why he gave it me. Brothers in arms you see. Do you like the noise it makes?
-Not much.
A short time later they roared into the sad little street where Ali Abbas had his lodgings and Tim slammed the car to an abrupt halt, with just a small amount of tyre squeal. The little Indian guy was outside waiting for them already. He looked at the bright orange monster with an expression of fascinated terror. David started to say hello, while Tim, in a state of high excitement, practically bundled Ali Abbas into the car. 
On the way to the farm, David kept turning round to the back, where Ali Abbas was cowering; trying to engage him in conversation, but the boy was so painfully shy and the car so loud that they only managed to exchange a few words. 
They arrived earlier than planned. Handwritten signs had been posted in the neighbourhood to direct the guests to the venue. Someone who might have been an old servant, or possibly just a member of the girl’s family, pointed them towards a field where a number of vehicles were already stationed. 
-If it rains now they’ll have to get the Land Rover to pull us out, grumbled Tim.
Safely parked and following the other guests inside, they soon met with Patricia, who seemed genuinely delighted to see them. She made some introductions that were instantly forgotten and then she had David by the arm and was leading him off somewhere. Tim also had some definite objective of his own in mind, because he was gone moments later, leaving Ali Abbas worrying whether his suit was appropriate and wondering what was expected of him now.
The next four hours were not the worst of Abbas’ life, although for a short time it felt like they would be. He stumbled into a marquee that was full of people and noise, so dark and so loud that it would have been impossible to have a conversation with anyone even if he had known how to begin one. From there he passed to the buffet, where the guests were being offered immense slabs of meat of various kinds. Ali Abbas did not call himself a vegetarian, but the proximity to so much dead flesh made him feel queasy. He fled. For a while, he was standing in the dark outside hoping not to be noticed, but soon the party activity spilled into the open air. It was the usual Saturday night goings on, but speeded up by the availability of free alcohol. Early on, the sort of men who thought that finding a toilet was too much trouble started making their way outside to relax their straining bladders in the shrubbery. Before long couples were storming across the lawns in pursuit of one another as drunken arguments began. It was barely dark when he saw two boys, looking absurdly youthful in hired dinner jackets, crouching over to vomit in the hedge. 
He found sanctuary in the main house, where a number of quiet rooms had been set aside for the social use of family and friends of the family: persons of more mature years who were obliged to attend, but could not be expected to tolerate the volume and energy of the main event. He was offered a cup of tea, and found that the guests seemed genuinely eager to talk with someone who was studying for a degree, even if they were a little confused by his earnest replies to their questions. 
Ali Abbas was a good speaker when he had something to say, and it was obvious that the elderly ladies in particular were charmed by him. One of the men wanted to have a serious conversation with him about life in Africa, and it turned out that the man was neither a racist nor a fool. Abbas started to forget where he was and even to enjoy himself.
A number of his present companions seemed to be quietly drinking themselves into a polite stupor, which Abbas found puzzling, but he reasoned that if they were prepared to make allowances for the extraordinary discovery that he did not drink alcohol at all, he should extend a reciprocal open-mindedness to them, even the ones who appeared to be snoring where they sat. 
It was well after midnight when he returned to the marquee. The crowd had thinned out and he easily spotted Tim. He was relieved to see that whatever the strange young man had been doing, he seemed to be in possession of his faculties, even if he was rather red in the face. 
The music was not so much dying as fading away. Clearly it was the end of the night and time to go home. They found David and Patricia in a small group of people talking in what seemed a fairly coherent way. 
Patricia suggested that David should stay the night if room could be found. He replied that it would be wrong to abandon his mates. David said a few words to Tim, obviously trying to assess his condition. Tim seemed fine, though uncharacteristically quiet. 
-What have you been doing all night, I hardly saw you?
-Lots to do. Charming ladies to discuss matters with. I been dancing mainly. Don’t worry, haven’t touched a drop. 
-God you’re wet through. Must have been dancing all night. I didn’t realize the music was that good. 
-Shit music. Doesn’t matter once you’re on the floor. 
-What about you Abbas?
-I have enjoyed a most pleasant evening, thank you. And my thanks to Patricia for inviting me. 
The car park had emptied quickly and they soon found Tim’s friend’s car. Once they had bumped across the field and edged out of the gate, Tim put his foot down and the noise of the engine cocooned each of them in his own private thoughts. No one spoke as the car sped through the curves and over the humps of the country roads. 
David was musing about Patricia, considering what would be the right way to tell her of his feelings and plans. He supposed that a girl would be more receptive to a proposal when her friend was already getting engaged. All the girls had seemed to glow with excitement when wedding plans were being discussed. Thoughts and impressions from the party and plans for the future were washing back and forth in his mind as the darkness enveloped them. His attention drifted. 
Suddenly, he was called back to the moment. It happened so quickly that the boundary between reality and imagination seemed not to exist. 
The car had been accelerating gradually without David noticing. Now he saw that they were travelling much too fast for the condition of the road. After that everything happened in a blur.
For some reason he looked first to the back seat where Ali Abbas was sitting very upright. The boy’s face only wore the same expression of resigned terror that he had shown on the way to the party. When it came to driving, Abbas had no way to differentiate between too fast, and certain to crash. 
Next David turned to his right and was shocked to see Tim holding the steering wheel loosely, eyelids half closed, his shoulders sagging forward against the resistance of the seatbelt. 
-Tim, are you asleep?
There was no time to grab the wheel. They heard and felt a hard impact. David whirled round to face the road in front of them and thought he saw something big that could have been a body thump into the windscreen and over the roof.
It was already too late to save the car. Tim came to with a start and pressed all the pedals hard, dragging the wheel hard to his left, but the car steered itself neatly into the ditch running alongside the road on the driver’s side, the nearside wheels remaining on the tarmac and the underside of the car scraping along the ground and complaining horribly. A combination of road camber, the depth of the ditch, and the absolute lack of further intervention by the driver, who seemed to have passed out, ensured that by great good fortune the car skidded to a halt, half buried in undergrowth, but without turning over or hitting one of the many trees that lined the way. 
The engine had stalled and for a moment the night was very quiet; impossibly so after the noise of the previous moments. 
-Tim, you fucking stupid fuck up. Tell me you’re not dead.
-No
-Good, I’m going to kill you now. 
-I’m okay, said Ali Abbas, from the back. We should get out now though. I think the wheel at my side came off and the bottom was scraping along the road. There could be a leak in the fuel tank. 
He did know something about cars after all or at least about the theory of them. 
They dragged Tim, still semi-conscious, away from the vehicle to what felt like a safe distance. David checked his friend’s pulse, which was racing. His eyes looked funny, but it was difficult to see them properly in the moonlight. David thought that he might have had some kind of fit. He was grinding his teeth and now David remembered that he’d started doing that earlier in the journey home.
-I thought he’d had a heart attack.
Ali Abbas shrugged helplessly.
-We need to find him a doctor.
Tim put a hand on David’s arm.
-No Doctor. Speed, he said.
-What?
-Pills, speed.
-You’ve taken drugs? Tim nodded.
David looked at him with disgust. 
-Well you’re more stupid than I thought, and you’ve wrecked your friend’s car and almost killed us.
-We should find some water for him, suggested Abbas.
-And drown him in it, David agreed. 
-Not friend’s car, Tim struggled to say. 
Tim wasn’t making any sense. Ali Abbas was in the habit of carrying mineral water wherever he went. He jogged back to the car to retrieve the bottle. Tim drank greedily once they had forced the bottle to his lips, and gradually they were able to piece together the story of the night from his fragments of coherent speech: how he’d planned to have only soft drinks but spice them with the pills, which he now thought maybe he’d overdone; how he’d decided to borrow a nice car for the evening, something better than his own heap, but there was no friend who had offered the keys. He saw a car he liked and took it. 
-But you had keys, I saw you.
-Brought my own keys for the look of the thing. It’s a Ford. Easy enough.
He seemed exhausted beyond measure. 
-David, I think you’ve probably got everything useful he can tell us, Ali Abbas said gently. We can’t stay here all night. 
-And in the morning, we’ll be charged with taking a vehicle without consent, at least; and who do you think will believe that the two of us didn’t know what was going on? I get a conviction and I can say goodbye to my legal career. Probably the army puts it down to youthful high spirits on Tim’s part; unless the drugs part comes out. You, I don’t know.
-My mother will die if she hears about this. 
David had no reply for that. They were silent for a moment.
-We hit something, or someone, he said He had been avoiding saying it for some time.
-I don´t know, Ali Abbas claimed, miserably. 
They listened. The night was completely silent. No moans of pain or cries for help.
-I was looking at Tim, when we hit, David said after a while. You must have seen something. 
-I thought there was a person, Ali Abbas admitted. I have an image of someone; an old lady. But I must have imagined it. I was so frightened. What would an old lady be doing on the road at this time of night?
-She could be walking her dog.
-Wouldn´t we hear the dog?
-We have to check, David said. He walked back to the car. Ali Abbas stayed where he was. He felt unable to move. 
He strained to watch a vague shadow walk back to the car. He lost sight of the figure against the dark bulk of the wrecked vehicle; then he saw David’s shape pacing up and down the road for a while. In his own mind, Ali Abbas felt only a strange calm, surprising to himself, and an absolute reluctance to do anything but remain exactly where he was.
Eventually David returned.
-There´s nothing on the car that looks like we hit a person, he announced.
-You mean no blood, Ali Abbas asked him?
-I couldn´t see anything at all. They left it at that. And I couldn´t see a sign of anyone along the road. There´s no sound.
-That may not mean anything, Ali Abbas felt obliged to say. An impact at that speed could send even something heavy a long way. Impossible to calculate the direction. If it was something. If it was a person who... couldn´t make a noise. Maybe you wouldn´t find them till daylight, even with a proper search.
-Don´t talk like that, we don´t know there was anyone; or anything. Could have been a deer if it wasn´t our imagination. Most likely there was nothing at all.
-Do you think?
-There´s more, David said. I was looking along the road. I suppose I was hoping there would be a lake we could push the car into, or some other magical way to hide the damn thing, but maybe I found something better. 
-What?
-This road looked familiar. There’s a sign back there, just before we started to skid, that confirmed it to me. We were coming back on ourselves. This idiot had started to drive us in circles. The car is facing the wrong way for going back to town.
-I don’t see how that helps us.
-Look: a car was stolen in the city by some joyriders who ran it off the road here. Happens all the time. Nothing to do with us. 
-Apart from all the people who saw us at the party.
-It’s just a Ford car. It was dark. No one noticed what we arrived in. Did you see all the really fancy cars that were there? Anyway, they’re country folk. Probably think nothing of it. Wouldn’t be the first time someone round here has driven their own car into a ditch blind drunk and then staggered home and reported it stolen next day.
-But it’s not our car
-So we don’t even have to report it. I’m telling you, no one will connect this to us, and even if they did, they couldn’t prosecute without evidence. And there is none, provided we all stick to the same story.
-The car is evidence.
-Not if it’s burnt out and it’s pointing the opposite way to the way we were going. That’s what joyriders do with cars when they’re finished with them. They set them alight. 
-You’ve got tears in your eyes David. You’re upset or you wouldn’t be talking like this. If we set the car on fire it’s another crime, and it’s dangerous. We’re not the sort of people who do things like that.
-Any sort of people can do any sort of things, David snapped. It’s a question of deciding to do them and it’s a question of will, but we have to decide together. Me and you. Don’t worry about him. He’ll do whatever we tell him. For you and me, it’s a simple choice: whether we want to wreck our futures or live with one lie on our conscience.
-I’m not a liar, David.
-Nor am I, believe me. I’m someone who is meant to make the world a better place. I have things to do: important things. And I am not going to give them up because of this stupidity. So this is what we are going to do. We’re not so far from home, not much more than three miles. We can easily walk it before light. There’s a smell of petrol around that car already. It won’t need much to help it on its way. We just take off the filler cap and light a rag soaked in petrol. It will go up in seconds I suppose. There’s no-one around to see at this hour unless we are really unlucky. No-one’s come past all the time we’ve been here. After, we go home, we go to bed, and forget about it. If anybody asks questions, we went to the party in Tim’s old Ford, and anyone who remembers different is mistaken. 
-What if they don’t believe us?
-What matters, so long as we stay calm, is what they can prove. 
-But David, we might have injured someone. They could be lying out there somewhere.
-Or they could be dead, in which case we can´t help; or that person could be an animal, or might only exist in your imagination, which is most likely. Or are you telling me that you definitely saw someone?
-I just don´t know.
-I´m going back to the car.
Ali Abbas was terrified that David would set fire to himself, or that the car would explode, but in the end, everything turned out exactly as David had said it would, except that the walk back was more than three miles. Tim revived a little as they walked, but a look from David told him to keep quiet and after that he slouched along a little way behind the other two. 
Ali Abbas was uncertain how he would react if he was ever asked questions about that night. Whether he would be able to maintain the lie, he didn’t know. But he never needed to find out, because they heard no more about the car or the accident. He supposed that the car had been reported as just one more stolen vehicle, not interesting to anybody. He never checked the newspapers or tried to find out if there had been a person injured on the roads that night. He was fairly confident that David didn’t search the news either.
David never spoke to him about that night; never contacted him at all. At first Ali Abbas was resentful that his own complicity was taken so much for granted. There should be some kind of meeting of conspirators, he thought. But then, what would they have to say to each other?
But for years afterwards he had a dream in which some obscure and forgotten guilt was coming back to him from an imaginary past. As the dream progressed the lies unravelled and his part in whatever awful crime had been committed came to light. He would wake up half believing that he really must have done the evil thing that was being exposed in his dream and that he had somehow made himself forget the awful things he had done. 
It was a dream that never left him entirely, even when it went away for months at a time. The dream that took many forms but it always involved some hidden guilt that was gradually revealed to those who loved him. Much later on, when he thought about some of the truly bad things he had done, this incident seemed so trivial that it made him smile. Even so, it was that night which brought him the dream; and the dream came to define him. When he thought about it like that, a part of him despised his own weakness and just for a moment he knew that he hated David Thomas.

***

The next year was their final year of studies. It passed strangely. People kept to themselves more, either determined to excel or desperate to retrieve some kind of degree from the wreckage of their course work. Once Christmas was over, everyone was looking forward to May – work hard until then, and after one final long summer to enjoy whatever else should happen. Not many of them were like David, carefully planning the future with his next steps already worked out. 
At the end of March, the English parliament passed a motion of no-confidence in the country’s government, which meant there would be a general election soon. The final year students hardly noticed. There was too much else to think about. 
The election was at the beginning of May and the Conservative party won a big majority. At the end of that month, the students sat their last examinations, said their unnatural sounding goodbyes, and went away determined to forget about university until the results should be published. Those whose parents could afford it went off on holidays. Others looked for casual summer jobs or hung on in the city, struggling to eke out the last of their grant finance. One or two already had jobs to go to or, like Tim, obligations to honour. 
When the exam results were published, Ali Abbas registered a sense of quiet satisfaction that lasted for a whole day and a morning. Then he began to worry about what he should do next. In the exams, he had done even better than he’d hoped. His grades were more than good enough for him to take up the postgraduate course that had been lined up for him. Everyone in the family took for granted that his academic career was just starting, and that it would be brilliant. Only Ali Abbas himself was no longer sure that he even wanted to return to a university. 
There was another problem. He had been looking forward to spending time at home after the discomfort and loneliness of college. Everything there would be easy for him there, except that when he came home, he found that he no longer belonged. The daily routines and private family concerns of which he had once been part now felt silly and empty; like an old and once treasured toy that makes you smile when you find it in the back of a drawer. It was nice to see, but it no longer had any meaning for him. 
He felt he’d lost both his future and his past. In any case, the family, under the surface, was not the same, even if no one else saw it, Ali Abbas had noticed that his father had become old; worn down, not just by exile, but by the life they had found in their new home. 
It was better that Grandfather had not lived to see it. He had always been so proud of working for the British, of being a civil servant, and of what he called his English education. The family had understood what their passports confirmed, that they were privileged participants in the great British Empire. No wonder that some Ugandans hated them more than the whites. The Asians in Africa were administrators; they didn’t seek out or even desire great wealth, but they had education and position, which for his family counted more.
Things had started to change in the time of his father’s generation. After independence, government posts were quickly closed to Asians. For a time, that seemed to be a blessing in disguise for the family. His father was young, confident and resourceful and soon he was working for himself and earning more money as a merchant than Grandfather could have dreamed of at his humble clerk’s desk. Before Ali Abbas was born they had moved into the big new house and opened more stores, investing profits for the future.  
But resentment continued to grow; in fact it worsened. The new people in charge didn’t know how to run a country. They’d never had the chance to learn, since the British had never really prepared to leave. Conditions became worse for the ordinary people, but every day men like Abbas’ father seemed to grow richer. Even a happy little boy, playing in his father’s store while his aunt served the customers, noticed mysterious scowls and heard ferocious voices complaining about prices: raised voices that suddenly sounded very different to the happy raucous cacophony of the street, or home.
And that was before the maniac, Amin.
In any case they had left it behind and things turned out not so badly. His father was resourceful, knew how to grow a business, but these days he walked around like a beaten man. He did not say much, but Ali Abbas thought he understood. It was the prejudice. His father was an understanding, tolerant man. He’d been able to see why the black Africans resented them and how the hatred was being stirred up by bad leaders. It was a bad situation, sometimes terrifying, but the reasons were clear. 
In Britain it was different. Being British had always been a source of family pride, and his father had been pleased to come here, in spite of the weather. He’d been eager to contribute to the common good and become a respected person in his neighbourhood. Instead, all the time he was talked to as if he was both very stupid and incapable of understanding anything and on the other hand very crafty for having sneaked himself and his family into the country. 
It was assumed that they had arrived from Pakistan, a country they only knew about as a name on a map, and that the family was in receipt of large, unspecified handouts from the state. Abbas’ father and people like him were regarded as a problem at best. At worst he met with open hostility, not so different to what he had left behind in Africa. 
Not long after they arrived, father had read something aloud to them from the English newspaper. It was an article reporting that one of the big English cities had paid for advertisements in the newspapers to advise Ugandan Asians that they would not be welcome to settle there. Father had chuckled and told them that it showed that there were a few very silly people in every part of the world.
-You might come across something like this at school in the first few weeks, he had warned them. Just take no notice and it will all be forgotten before you know. 
For some reason his father had taken up a pair of scissors and cut out the article. He’d folded it away carefully: maybe he had it still, but if so, Abbas did not believe that reading it again would still make him smile. 
In his turn, Ali Abbas had started to regard certain doors as closed to him. The old idea that he would discover the meaning of the powerful forces that shaped destinies and maybe one day be in a position to influence them in some small way now seemed very fanciful. And the more he understood these forces and how they became manifest in the real world, the more distaste he felt for the structures of power. It was as if power arose only from the worst impulses of humanity. Ali Abbas was not quick to pass judgement on anyone, but when he found himself in the presence of people behaving badly, his first instinct was always to leave the room. 
Lately he’d started to think that maybe his life should take a more practical direction. For example, he knew there were still family members and contacts spread across Africa. He had a vague notion that there must be some way to use that network. He could become a merchant, like his father (though it would break his mother’s heart). Lots of people seemed to make their living by travelling; perhaps he could do the same. He couldn’t be like everyone else. He didn’t want to be like everyone else. And if he could not feel at home here or anywhere, why not make use of that condition?
Already, university life seemed like a fading memory. He had almost forgotten that he would have to go back for graduation, although the day was never far from his mother’s thoughts. In her mind she imagined a carnival of celebration that would acknowledge her son’s achievement. No words of his about what would really happen at the modest ceremony could prick that bubble. 
Ali Abbas knew very well what was involved. They would be dressed up like pantomime scholars and crowded into the great hall. When your name was called, you walked up in front of everyone, shook hands with some important person and received a scroll of paper. Then you had your photograph taken to prove that you had been there. That was it: the whole thing would be a huge anticlimax and perhaps he would be embarrassed by the family, but there was no way to avoid it. 
At least it so happened that his congregation date would be the same as Patricia and David’s, and David’s two friends, so he might have a familiar face to show his parents. Maybe Steve Kirk would be there as well. If he could say hello to one or two people, he wouldn’t come across as such a loner. It was just another day to be got through, somehow. Afterwards he would need to take a hard look at his life: something in it had to change; of that he was more and more certain.

***
  
The degree ceremony was a pain for everyone, not just Abbas. Attendance wasn’t compulsory and many recent graduates expressed a real or pretended reluctance to show up. But then there were the parents, insistent or nagging, and the irritating sensation that the whole three or four year experience had not been properly punctuated. There ought to be something more at the end of it than those hurried goodbyes exchanged after the final exam. In the end most of the students decided or were grudgingly persuaded to congregate. 
David had no romantic illusions about college and his life was already moving forward. Given his father’s undemonstrative nature, the ceremony might have passed him by, except that it was an opportunity for David to bring his family and Patricia’s together. 
In any case, his Uncle Bobby somehow found out that each student could be accompanied by two adults, and from that time on Bobby was determined to join the party and make sure that they all made a fine day of it. There was never any doubt that Patricia’s mother and father would be there, so the meeting arranged itself. 
Matthew’s mother and father had not spoken for years. Even if she’d had any idea where he might be, mother would see no reason why father should be welcome at her son’s graduation. There was an understanding that Matthew’s elder sister Brenda, three years married and pregnant again, would accompany her. 
No one had heard from Tim so as usual no one knew what to expect from him, but on the day he did turn up, unaccompanied. He gave a vague explanation about his parents having intended to accompany him but something urgent had come up at the last minute. By the time Matthew and David met him, he’d already attended his own ceremony earlier that day. He had no time to talk as he wanted to return the hired gown as quickly as possible and be done with the whole sorry business. They had barely arranged a time and place to meet later before Tim was gone. 
The formalities of the day were every bit as perfunctory and unsatisfying as expected, but afterwards the hired photographer seemed to be determined that at least his own part in the day should not be quickly over. David quickly tired of his attentions. After a while, even his father commented that it was getting a bit much. 
-Finish taking the snaps and let’s get on, David instructed him, but the man behind the camera was used to fractious clients and not to be hurried. 
Nothing could dampen the spirits of Uncle Bobby. Eyes shining, grinning, with a friendly comment for friends and strangers alike; he was in a fine humour. He found much to admire in the architecture of the university buildings. Although most of the teaching was done in more utilitarian surroundings, the graduates and their guests had access to the leafy environs of the central area for this one day at least. 
-Look at that stonework, Uncle Bobby enthused. You can see it has that feeling of being really … old. And wise too. You feel as these buildings have wisdom absorbed into the stones.
David informed his uncle that his lectures had been delivered in a shed of a building that was in the process of falling apart, less than a decade after it was built, but Bobby was undismayed. 
-It’s the spirit of the place that matters, he insisted. I should’ve gone to university myself you know. I could’ve done, if the times had been different. You lads have been lucky. 
-I’m not sure you missed that much Uncle. 
Patricia appeared with her parents and, not long after that, Matthew with his mother and sister joined them. Uncle Bobby was overjoyed to meet the sort of people who sent their children to university. If he closed his eyes and only listened, David could imagine his uncle hopping from one foot to the other with gleeful excitement. But then, everyone seemed cheerful; apart from Brenda, Matt’s sister who always had that long suffering expression and never said much; and of course Patricia’s mother, whose expression never strayed far from haughty.
-Finally, she said, we have managed to extricate ourselves from the clutches of that photographer.
-Ours is just finishing now, Mr Thomas replied
-I only hope the results are worth all the fuss they make about taking them. How tiresome it all is. 
Uncle Bobby responded.
-Well, but it’s only once in a lifetime isn’t it? They want to get it right. I remember when Marie and me were married. Marie was almost freezing to death; we were stood outside that long. At least it’s nice and bright today and then we can enjoy the rest of it, eh? I’m Bobby, David’s uncle, very pleased to meet you. Nice to meet other scholars and their parents, isn’t it? I didn’t catch your name.
-Irene, said Patricia’s mother, holding out a gloved hand, which Bobby shook energetically.
David stepped in. 
-Did you have any plans for the rest of the day Mrs Harrison?
Irene spoke about wanting to get back home as quickly as possible. They were travelling by train and she thought that the next one should due in about an hour. 
She was a smartly dressed lady, a little underweight, with neat, black hair and carefully applied makeup. Her husband, who was mostly silent, seemed much older and quite frail, short and stooping as well as rather portly. His remaining hair was white, and all the life he had left in his body was concentrated in his small grey eyes, that seemed to be smiling at a private joke.
-Mother, we can’t just disappear after we’ve come all this way.
Hearing Patricia’s tone, David could tell that her day so far had been difficult.
-Nay, you can’t go just yet. We should have a meal at least, and something to drink together, protested Uncle Bobby. 
-I’m really not hungry, Irene responded. 
-We don’t need to catch the very next train dear, said her husband. There’s a good service through till six. 
Irene sighed heavily. 
Then Patricia caught sight of Ali Abbas and his parents walking down the far side of the small quadrangle. They had not noticed her own group. The Patels looked out of place, she thought: although they were smiling patiently at everything going on around them. Abbas himself looked most uncomfortable; a slight, comic figure, still wearing his mortar board hat and a gown several sizes too big, that made him look even skinnier and more childlike than normal, if that were possible. 
-Abbas, come over, she called. 
Uncle Bobby was fascinated by the Patels. At home, he said, the only Asians he knew were the family who ran the local curry shop. He said it was rare for him to have the chance to talk to people from different backgrounds.
-I didn’t go to college myself, but I’m always looking out for opportunities to learn something new about life.
Patricia glanced to check her mother’s expression. 
-You must come with us, Bobby told Mr Patel. We’re just away to have a celebration meal. I’ve a place comes recommended. And we should get a move on young David. His friend is going to join us you know and the poor lad is on his own. We don’t want to keep him waiting.
They were not given time to argue and so the whole group, with the exception of Brenda, who claimed family commitments, was pressed or cajoled to follow Uncle Bobby to the place his friend had told him about that served good sized steaks not too pricey, with wine if you wanted to push the boat out and didn’t like bitter. 
Tim was not there when they arrived, but David and Matthew assured everyone that this was nothing to worry about: he would come in his own time. Fortunately there was space and seating for everyone. Uncle Bobby had started his second pint by the time the tables were pushed together and the cutlery was laid out. David watched Patricia trying to help the Patels with the menu, while keeping an eye on the company in general.
He noticed that his father, not normally a heavy drinker, was not far behind Uncle Bobby in draining his glass. The occasion called for it, he supposed. He looked at Matthew’s mother; nothing like him or his sister. She was a small self-contained lady with a determined but not unfriendly expression. She seemed happy enough to sit and listen to the conversation, a glass of lemonade untouched in front of her. 
-I don’t know what they’ll do with their lives; his father was telling her a little later on. It’s good that they have qualifications, obviously, but outside London, it seems that all the jobs are disappearing fast. We’ve only got industries in this part of the world, and they can’t match overseas competition – firms that are starting from scratch. They don’t have the old fashioned ways like us. They don’t have the skills either mind. But the truth is, our industries have given up. The owners have all made enough money over the years and now their children are concentrating on spending it. Everything’s owned by shareholders now; and they only want to get rich quick and move on. It’s an exhausted country. 
-There’s no chance I’ll be sitting back ruined by my inheritance, Dad.
-A good thing too David. A little money when you start is alright, but too much is not good for you. 
-What a quaint idea, said Patricia’s mother.
-You can smile Irene, but it’s true. These days it’s too easy for people to forget themselves and where they came from.
Matthew could see that Mr Thomas was becoming serious. David would be annoyed.
-No one will ever forget where I come from, with my accent; he interrupted, grinning at his mother.
But Mr Thomas was not to be deflected.
-They may end up having to go down to London to find work, he concluded darkly.
-No way.
-That won’t happen.
-I adore London, said Irene. Ah look, a late arrival, it must be our missing soldier. 
At the far side of the room, Tim could be seen asking a waitress for information. Then he walked, rather unsteadily, towards them. Uncle Bobby stood up to greet him. 
-We had to start I’m afraid. They’ll bring you something quick enough if you order right away. But sit down first, let’s make the introductions.
Tim sat heavily in a vacant chair and told them he was not hungry. He called the girl over anyway and asked for a pint of whatever the rest of the company was drinking. Mr and Mrs Patel exchanged concerned glances. There was something intimidating about Tim. 
-That Margaret Thatcher is a real bitch, he announced.
-We shouldn’t really be discussing politics, Patricia suggested. It’s a special occasion for everyone.
-Why not talk about it? Our future, Tim responded. 
-And why in your opinion is Mrs Thatcher a bitch? enquired Irene.
David tried to steer the situation to a more neutral place.
-Whether you like her or not, she’s been successful, so far at least. I read that the election was the biggest swing to an opposition party since forties
-More to do with Labour if you ask me, said Uncle Bobby cheerfully. Jim Callaghan should have been pensioned off years ago. He was only hanging on so Healey wouldn’t get the job. That’s not playing the game. But it was the strikes and unions really; that and they needed to do something about immigration.
Matthew covered his eyes briefly. His mother pounced on Bobby’s comment.
-You don’t agree with unions, Mr Thomas?
-Well, yes in principle of course. The working man is entitled to stand up for himself and the bosses don’t give anything away without a fight. But it gets beyond a joke, if you know what I mean.
-What I want to know, growled Tim, is who voted for the bitch.
Abbas answered him, while Uncle Bobby signalled for more drinks for all round, even though most of the table still had half filled glasses in front of them.
-The Tory campaign was very directed, he explained. They went for first time voters, like us students, and floating voters. It’s a small proportion of people who haven’t already made up their minds that are the most important in any election, but no-one has really campaigned in that way before. It’s quite interesting, to me anyway, how they targeted their messages. And of course securing the backing of the popular press was very important.
-The popular press? Tim’s aggression was not to be deflected. You mean the Sun? That’s not a newspaper, and you can be sure its support came at a price.
-Well they never got your vote, David reminded Tim, because you never got as far as the polling station.
-I was busy.
-I thought it was time that maybe a woman should be in charge, said Mrs Patel, timidly. No-one responded.
-What do you think Thatcher will do now? asked Matthew’s mother.
Abbas had an answer ready for that one.
-Based on what the Conservatives are saying, you can expect a radical shift in politics; very different from previous Tory administrations. If the economic policies that are being proposed are carried through, the short term effects will be quite severe. 
-The country needs a good shake up, Irene commented. 
Bobby smiled at everyone.
-They all say they are going to change the world before they get in power, he observed. Afterwards one lot is much the same as the other.
Abbas smiled too.
-I was about to say that history shows that the realities of power tend to limit the ambitions that politicians develop in opposition. The cost of making structural changes is high, with no guarantee that the outcome will be a success. Just as you said.
-Too many of them are cowards, commented Irene. That’s the problem. It’s different if you have self belief, like she does.
-In any case, Abbas continued, the Prime Minister’s position is not impregnable. She won the leadership more or less by accident, because other candidates tripped up.
-Or were too frightened to stand, said Irene. Doesn’t matter how she won. She is the leader now. That’s what counts.
Matthew’s mother spoke.
-All those so-called senior ministers toadying around her make me feel ill. I read one of them saying how they find her so attractive. But look at her; she’s like a mad headmistress. And they’re like little boys at public school who want their matron. She’s got them wrapped round her finger, looks like.
-Her husband is very rich you know; a millionaire, Irene said.
-What does that have to do with it?
-Everything. Money smells of power, let’s be honest. And rich people know other rich people and feel comfortable with them. Because Denis is rich, other rich people will talk to him and to her, like they never would to that grocer Heath. And so she’ll get lots of good advice from successful people.
-Why is it good advice? Good for them you mean? 
Matthew could see that his mother was on the verge of being seriously annoyed, but Irene smiled at her serenely.
-The people who create wealth understand things. They are the ones who are able to help make the country wealthy. Of course it won’t be easy or painless.
Mr Thomas finally spoke. He had been unusually quiet for a while and David hoped that there was not going to be a storm. He’d had a lot to drink, but his voice was calm and very matter of fact. 
-She’ll do what she likes, he said. Where it will end, I don’t know. What I do know, what seems to be the case in this country; is that the working man has given up and decided he prefers to be told what to do. I knew she would win, long before the polling day. I’ll tell you how. I was down at the Legion. I nip in now and again – beer’s cheap. And there’s this chap watching the television, intently, and he says to me; who’s that on the screen? He’s never off it these days. So I looked and said, that’s Jim Callaghan, he’s the Prime Minister, and he says well I wish he’d get to the end of what he has to say, I’m waiting for the racing. I asked him if he knew there was an election on and he said yes, he was going to vote for the other lot. So I asked him why, and he tells me have you not seen them posters down the street saying Labour’s Not Working and a queue of chaps on the dole. Dole queues and that like the old days. I can’t afford not to work. I said it’s an advert, it’s not real. The people in the picture are actors. Have you read anything about what the other lot want to do? He looked at me like I was daft and he says, what read about it? I haven’t time for that. One lot is more or less the same as the other, just a bunch of gobshites all round. And I realized if they can get shipbuilders and steelworkers and the like, drinking cheap beer in affiliated clubs; men that haven’t got a pot to piss in, beg your pardon, to think like that and to vote for them, then it’s as I say; they can do what they like. 
-Aye well, said Uncle Bobby, smiling a little desperately now. You don’t want to take that to heart so. It was the strikes you see, in the winter. They just took it too far. Beyond a joke. 
The rest of the afternoon went well. No food or punches were thrown and even Tim subsided into a good natured stupor. At the parting, everyone agreed how much they had enjoyed the day, and there was a friendly haggle over the bill, all the parents determined to contribute more than their proper share. 
Outside it was still light. Patricia and her parents had to dash for their train so the goodbyes were hurried. The Patel family seemed dazed. Tim said he was off to find a proper drink. Then it was time for Matthew and David to part. They shook hands, which felt uncomfortable but necessarily formal.
-You were quiet today, David said.
-Plenty of other people talking. Anyway, lots for us to think about isn’t there? One thing is certain though
-What’s that Matthew?
-From now on, nothing will ever be the same again. Our lives, the country, maybe the world. I´m quiet because I´m imagining what it will all be like in a few years time.
David paused, before answering in all seriousness.
-It will be what we make it, of course.

Chapter Two

It wasn´t many years later that Mr. and Mrs. David Thomas completed the purchase of their first real home. 
The house in Oakland Ridge was almost too perfect. David would never have found anything like it at the price if he had not been on such good terms with the agent. Any of Robert’s buyers who weren’t already signed to a lawyer would be directed to David, and David made sure that business was good for both him and Robert. The tip about the house was a way of cementing their relationship.
It wasn’t in the most fashionable part of town and its condition when they moved in was rather neglected, but even then the house was impressive. Architecturally, its construction was simple and massive. It stood near the top of a low hill, commanding a view of neighbouring parkland from the upper floors. The ground floor was surrounded by an ample garden, gone wild, that was made secret by a high wall of good soot blackened stone.
There were three floors of huge, high ceilinged rooms arranged around spacious hallways. The upper floor bedrooms were a little cosier, nestling under a large skylight window set in the centre of the roof. The staircase rose directly under this window, guarded on three sides by an oak banister, forming a little atrium in the top of the building, flooded with natural light.
The play of light in the staircase and hallways was enhanced by the blue and red stained glass set in the tall windows of the first two elevations, giving the central space a soft yellow light that was like natural sunshine but softer. 
On the day they moved in, this was where they stood to take it all in. It didn’t matter that the carpets were ruined or that the heavy oak staircase was piled with layers of cracked and discoloured paint. David took Patricia in his arms and told her that the house would be their home always. Patricia had never felt so happy. Neither of them spoke about children; it was too soon for that, but she was glad that there was more than enough room for a large young family.
Everything was on a grander scale than the houses either of them had known before. The doorways were bigger; the ceilings were higher and more airy; even the cream coloured blocks of stone from which the walls were constructed seemed oversized. Every room had ornate cornices or little bits of tiling in odd places, giving each a little magic of its own. The internal layout had an elegant simplicity without being too predictable. All the flooring was badly in need of attention and some of the walls needed replastering, but only the kitchen was altogether beyond saving. 
As the house was built on the side of a hill, the rear elevation was lower than the front, which meant that the back kitchen door was above ground and access to the substantial cellar was down just a few steps. Here David made plans to establish his den and extend the property.  He could picture himself entertaining in the large rear dining room that looked out over the garden (they would make the windows bigger) and afterwards summoning the male guests to his private basement bar. 
The house needed work, but it seemed incredible that after two years of marriage, they could have this much already. The couple seemed blessed in other ways. It was clear to all his colleagues that the new boy at Simpson Rose, the one with the pretty barrister for a wife, was going places fast. How he managed it was a mystery; and as the carefully planned social invites began to arrive from Oakland Ridge, there was more surprise and some muttering that such a junior member of the firm could afford to live so splendidly and entertain so well. It was assumed that there must be family money; a misapprehension that David did nothing to correct. One or two wise heads surmised that young Mr Thomas was living on credit, gambling on a quick success and hoping to avoid painful failure. The truth was that David had given no thought to failure. 
There were other colleagues who thought, privately or not so privately, that a chap like David Thomas had no business being at Simpson Rose in the first place; that he was too brash for their taste. After all, although Simpson’s was not the biggest firm in the city (David had avoided the biggest firms since they had too many people already in line for the top jobs) it was considered, at least by its partners and associate lawyers, to be the firm of quality. Simpson Rose did not admit just any young solicitor; and once you were in there were certain standards that had always been observed, even if one didn’t speak of them.
Then one day, in had marched this tall young chap; charming, good looking in a not too obvious way; seeming full of confidence, although he didn’t know anyone and everyone knew that he’d barely scraped a passable degree from the local redbrick. 
Worse than that, within a year of qualifying he was being talked of openly as a future partner. And all he seemed to do was property law; not exactly brain surgery, though you have to admit it pays the bills. There was talk of him bringing in a lot of business and being loved by the clients, as if that had anything to do with being made partner.
It was a sad state of affairs and times certainly were changing. These days the senior partners were more likely to ask you to explain your chargeable hours for the month than invite you for a round of golf. 
David had worked out early on that although property was not intellectually stimulating, not only did it pay very well, but the other work seemed to flow from it. He also realized that the senior partners of Simpson Rose were acutely conscious of these simple facts. Their unspoken policy was to reward young men like him very well in the early days and to promise them great things for the future. The work was arduous and stressful and the idea was to keep the young men running hard until they burned out, by which time a new intake of young men would be ready to replace them. But David had no intention of burning out. 
This kind of life was a war and he already had his plan of campaign. Oakland Ridge would be his base of operations as well as a weapon in his armoury. Besides it was an early fulfilment of the promises he had made to Patricia. For her, the house was simply a blessed space which the dedication of time and care would make perfect. 

***

Patricia’s own career did not progress so serenely as David’s. It had been hard to find chambers prepared to accept her as a pupil. A rare first class honours degree from the local law faculty should have opened doors for her, but instead it seemed to create new barriers. 
Heads of chambers wanted to know why she was looking at the provincial bar rather than London. As she made the rounds of interviews, one of them gently suggested that with an academic standard like hers, perhaps she should consider postgraduate study. Privately some of the interviewers noted that she was a rather shrill young girl; a little too intense. They somehow doubted that she would fit in. 
At least Patricia didn’t lack persistence. Eventually she found a place in a middling set of chambers that had one or two well thought of names. She resigned herself to the unavoidable grind of chores; running after the more experienced barristers, carrying papers, surviving on a meagre diet of guilty pleas in the magistrates’ courts: appearances that solicitors were too busy or lazy to attend to themselves. She kept busy by working extra hours as a volunteer at the local law centre and the citizen’s advice bureaux. David joined in at first to show support, but soon he was too busy to continue.
Unfortunately, Patricia felt as much out of place at the law centre as she did in the courts. All the time at university, she had been around people who came from a more privileged world. Matthew was always going on about it. Patricia recognized the differences but felt no sense of exclusion. It was the world that her mother had prepared her for, and though she thought that she disagreed with her mother about most things, it was the world where she most felt she belonged.
 She would share that gracious existence with the people who were born to it, although her own life would be validated by a career of good works and dedication to the cause of justice. But at the law centre, she experienced for the first time the sense of meeting a different class of people, whose concerns were really very different to her own. She was fascinated and sometimes appalled by the smallest details that only made David shrug and say there was nothing worth brooding over. 
At this stage in her life, Patricia spent a lot of time brooding, not so much about the lower classes as about the legal profession and her place in it. She’d told herself she was prepared for the routine frustration and humiliation of being a pupil working her way up. She’d been told what it would be like, but the daily reality was not so much the crushing embarrassments that were painful enough when they arrived, as the deadly dullness of it. And she didn’t want to become bitter. She was conscious that the experience of being an outsider, struggling for a foothold in a strange world, was leaving scars. 
Friends noticed something hard developing in her character. She became prone to sarcasm. It would have been easy to conclude that the cause was related to the contrast between hers and David’s experiences. Her brilliant academic career had led to humiliation and begging for work, while David, who’d never studied seriously, seemed to rise without visible effort. If there was any tinge of jealousy to her frustration, she would never allow David to see it. Other people close to her, Matthew for example, caught occasional glimpses of suppressed rage that sometimes threatened to overwhelm her calm exterior.
None of them saw much of Tim in those days. The army had sponsored his studies and now, as he said, he had to repay his debt to society. He thought that he would spend another year with the army of the Rhine, perfecting his German with as many girls as would speak to him and researching local brews. He came back on leave from time to time and didn’t seem much changed.  Apart from the short hair there was nothing military about him without a uniform: just the same skinny imp with dark eyes and a malicious sense of humour. It was the rest of them who were changing.
Matthew was still ever present in their lives. Like David and Patricia, he had stayed in the city after college. More accurately he’d never left. His family lived on the poorer south side of town, so going to university had only moved him a few miles north of home. He seemed less a leaf in the stream than a leaf in a flat becalmed pond. Matthew himself said that anything that happened to him resulted less from his conscious decisions as from his constant indecision. 
An unspectacular version of good fortune attended Matthew even when character failed him. When it had come to choosing colleges, he’d not wanted to stray far from home, preferring to be near to his mother. That had led to a problem about his grant, but somehow Mrs James had settled that with the education authority on his behalf. His father was long gone; dead so far as Mrs James was concerned, so an exception was made. He seemed reasonably intelligent and he applied himself moderately. At the end of three years he was duly certified Bachelor of Arts, but that left him with very little idea of what he might do next.
For a while, Matthew drifted, until someone from the faculty who remembered his name put him forward for a work experience vacancy with the local newspaper. It was an unusual kindness, but Matthew seemed to provoke a general goodwill in others without inspiring anything so positive as friendship. He put it down to the general air of haplessness that he supposed attached to his person, making others feel sorry for him. 
The idea was that he would spend a few weeks at the paper finding out whether he might be interested in going on to journalism school, but when his placement expired, it happened that the paper found itself short of a junior writer, so instead of returning to school, he stayed on as junior reporter. 
It wasn’t much but it was a real job. So long as he was careful to avoid being noticed enough to be singled out for promotion or dismissal, he might keep at it for years without his inner life being too much disturbed. It was enough that he had to contend with a vague competitiveness that he didn’t understand and preferred to deny, without the outside world getting in the way of his wish to lead a quiet life.
When it was known that he would be staying on at the paper, his boss told him that he should spend some time with Tuttle and Grayson, who would show him the rudiments of the craft. Up to then he had been doing mostly odd jobs. Mr Elliott explained to him that Richard Tuttle and Ralph Grayson were the senior staff reporters.
-Does that mean that they are in charge of the news?
-No, it bloody well does not, and don’t let them tell you otherwise.
Mr Elliott assured him that he would learn a lot from the senior reporters, who had a many years experience between them. They would be great fun to work with, he said. He led Matthew to the doorway of their office from where he made rudimentary introductions and left rather hurriedly. It seemed that Mr Elliott was not entirely comfortable in the presence of these two. 
Ralph Grayson looked at the new boy and grunted with disgust. Ralph was a tall spidery man in a tweed jacket with elbow patches. He had greasy dark hair and what remained of it on top was roughly combed over the bald patches. His face was long and thin, but it seemed that the top and bottom did not match, the high forehead was so narrow and the powerful jaw so pronounced. It was fascinating to see, a face composed of features that were ordinary in themselves but combined to make something so ugly. Matthew had to will himself not to look so directly at Ralph as to stare, without actually avoiding looking at him: it was an effort.
Richard seemed quite ordinary in comparison: short grey hair, slightly paunchy, a bit of a beard and reading glasses pushed well down a broad nose.
-Don’t expect us to waste our time showing you anything, were Ralph’s first words, and don’t get in my way. That ass Elliott told us to expect you, but I don’t suppose you will stay around very long. Most of them don’t. In too much of a hurry to land a job in radio, or one of the nationals, or maybe television. Anything they can get that doesn’t require more than a vague grasp of the English language. If they fail at that, some of them even leave to get proper jobs – working for a living, ugh. I suppose you have ambitions to work in television. 
He didn’t wait for an answer to this, but continued.
-Anyway, I have never liked being around children and please don’t expect me to make an exception in your case. In particular do not expect me to correct your grammar, syntax or spelling; although in all fairness I should warn you not to rely on our fool of an editor in that respect either. In fact probably you should avoid writing anything so far as that’s possible, as your likely to embarrass yourself. The best advice I can give you, as long as you’re here; observe, reflect, and be silent.
-Richard grinned at Matthew and offered his hand.
-Welcome, lad to the National Union of Journalists, Trappist monk section, he said.
***

It wasn’t an auspicious start, but soon Matthew decided that he might make a go of being a local newspaperman. He quickly got used to the slow rhythms of Richard’s soft Pennine accent and the harsher tones of Ralph’s acidic version of BBC English. It was easy to follow Ralph’s instruction to be quiet around these two: they seemed to have so much to say, not about the world as it should be, but the world as it was. He felt dull and stupid in comparison. For the first time (perhaps because no one joked about it) he was conscious of feeling shamed by his own brutal Leeds accent, rather than being aggressively defensive of it. 
Matthew found a one person flat to rent, that was not too expensive, but for him as for his friends, life centred on the house at Oakland Ridge. 
As soon as the house was fixed up enough for Patricia not to absolutely prohibit visitors, David and his wife began to host social evenings for the ever growing circle of friends and people who it would be useful for David to know. As an old friend of the family, Matthew had a standing invite. He joked that he was there to prove that the happy couple had lived ordinary lives before they became aspiring yuppies. The word was new; and its use made a few pained lines appear on David’s otherwise untroubled face. But Matthew had a certain licence to say uncomfortable things. Generally he behaved himself. 
Sometimes he would bring Carol with him, but more usually he’d be alone. Often Patricia would play hostess, attaching him to whichever lone guest seemed to be feeling out of place. 
A character so easily given to resentment as Matthew sometimes had to kick against becoming, as he said, a stage prop in someone else’s social life; but the truth was that he enjoyed these evenings, especially after the more stuffy guests had gone. Everyone relaxed and the serious drinking began. And although Matthew had felt ambivalent about alcohol as a student, now he joined in with the rest. With drink in him, he would feel less tongue tied, more able to talk to strangers. It gave him a feeling of freedom.  
David’s hospitality was lavish. Few of the guests knew or cared that much of the upper floor of the house was still in a condition that Patricia described as ruined. Towards the end of the night, drinking wine that was inappropriately good for the hour, one or other of the guests might wonder aloud how someone so young as David could afford such a fantastic home. 
Then David would talk like a wise estate agent for a few minutes, pointing out that the neighbourhood was not great (cheap new homes crowded outside its high walls and hedges). The house needed a lot of work and it would be too big for most buyers. True he’d negotiated a good deal but in all honesty the house would never sell for much (not that they intended to leave). The guests would nod at his modesty which didn’t alter the fact that the place was a mansion. Matthew knew that the reality was that David could not afford the house. He was gambling on being able to grow his income to match his outgoings before his situation became too serious.
His friend’s finances were one more thing for Matthew to worry about. Meanwhile, in the daytime at least, he had the job of writing for the paper to occupy his time.
He was offered plenty of advice. Someone told him that a local paper never used more than eight basic stories. The news was just these few standards, shuffled and rehashed. Richard told him that the nationals were the same. Ralph claimed that really there were only six stories not eight.
But there was more to it than just writing. Early on, there was a boy who had been killed in a horrific motorcycle accident and Matthew was assigned to get the human interest story from his girlfriend.
-Richard, why would she want to talk to a stranger about it?
-She won’t at first, that’s why we’re sending you. You’re young and sympathetic. Imagine what she’d think if Ralph went.
-But what can I say to her? 
Matthew was deeply uncomfortable. Richard’s smile was not unkindly.
-You don’t need to say much at all. Just ask her if she wouldn’t want the lad to be remembered. You could say “their love to be remembered” if you want to lay it on thick. Then just get a few details. The story writes itself.
-What do you mean?
-It’s a dying young story. Basically there’s two kinds. You can have promise unfulfilled or doomed romance. Promise unfulfilled is about what a brilliant person the victim would have turned out to be if he’d lived, so with a biker you’re better off with doomed romance. Have a look at some of my old clippings. You’ll get the drift.
-It seems wrong. Dishonest.
Richard saw his problem.
-Ah, ethics. You feel that we’re intruding and trivialising? Well look at it the other way round. The girl is going out with this boy and suddenly he’s smeared down the road; there one day, gone the next. Makes no sense to her or anyone else. She has the chance to say a few words about it to a young lad like yourself who’s so sincere that he seems a bit dim. Even if she thinks she’d rather not at first, it will do her good. And later she reads your piece and life makes a little more sense, because she understands her part. She’s the tragic bride to be. She’s read that story before about someone else. Now she knows how to behave; the facts have been given a meaning and a context.
-But it’s not her meaning. We’ve reduced her to a conventional figure.
Richard sighed.
-I could be pretentious and call it a shared narrative. The world repeats itself endlessly lad. The same tale with different players. That’s what’s true, as you’ll see soon enough. Individuality is not as important as you believe. It’s stories that we need. Without stories we wouldn’t know how to act at all.

Patricia had read about and visited the great Inns of Court in London and knew their histories. Lincoln’s Inn, Gray’s Inn, the Temple; names steeped in ancient mystery. You walked through their courtyards and escaped from the traffic of common humanity, into a little village of the intellect sheltered against the more brutal world outside. You felt rather than heard a song of old learning being sung by the weathered bricks of chambers; the spirit of the place. In Patricia’s mind at least, there was timeless magic in each of these places; each door with its painted wooden board announcing the names of tenants in a handwritten style. Only to read the names was to glimpse a different world; hyphenated surnames of the educated upper classes, exotic foreign sounding names. First names that would have been out of date a hundred years ago in any other setting. 
She had pictured herself in some future time; a tenant of chambers in the Temple, meeting clients and their solicitors in her own office that would be just shabby enough to express a careless grace. She would pour tea into an old and expensive set of plain thin china, and patiently explain her subtle insights on the client’s case from behind a battered desk that had given service to generations of counsel. In the summer, if she had no lunchtime meetings, she would make her way down the neat garden and slip through the small wrought iron gate to walk along the Embankment and feel that standing on the bank of the Thames, she was in the flow of history.
The dream had to change after she met and allowed herself to be wooed by David, who saw opportunities to make his mark in Leeds and had never even considered moving to the capital. She had resigned herself to working from provincial chambers, which provided an experience quite different from what she had imagined. 
By comparison to the Inns, the chambers in Leeds were just nondescript rooms, ill-adapted for use as modern office space. Patricia found them adequate, but not charming. Her own set was housed in a quaint old terrace in the main area, where at least there was a little square that was neat and had some growing things in the miniature park that it surrounded. As a new girl, Patricia was only entitled to an oversized cupboard in the basement dedicated for her use. From here she emerged to run errands and carry books, or make the occasional foray to the courts or the law library. Most of the time she barely spoke with the other barristers, and when she did, it was to experience the same sense of being cast adrift in a state of ignorance that she felt when she was in court.
Nothing in her studies had prepared her for this strange new world. The academic success that she’d bought so dearly was taken for granted, and of everything else she was ignorant. It was the unwritten rules; what everybody else but her knew how to say or do, that left her confused and humiliated. No explanations were offered. She told David that it was like trying to learn a dance while only being allowed to watch a few steps at a time. In a courtroom, the only thing she could feel confident about was that every time she opened her mouth, stood up, or sat down she was making herself look ridiculous to someone. 
David only commented that the bar was a club like any other. All clubs wanted to set themselves up as exclusive and so they developed irrational and pointless rules to keep the new members off balance until they became old members who would do to new members the same as had been done to them. It’s the reason they make you survive on crumbs at first, he said. They don’t want to let in fellows who actually need to work to earn money. It lowers the tone of the club.
-You know how it works, he told her. Make friends with the clerks. That’s the weak point in the system. A gentleman can’t concern himself with touting for work or haggling over money, so they have to hire some guy who left school with four o-levels to manage their business, and that’s who has the real power. The clerks earn more money than most of their briefs, just directing traffic and negotiating the fees.
So now Patricia had added sucking up to the clerks to the list of menial and humiliating chores she had to perform. 
And then one day, not long after she officially qualified, the door to her cupboard squeezed open and the face of the most junior clerk presented itself in the gap. 
-Gerry Wiseman wants to see you. He said now if it’s convenient.
The face was gone before she could reply.
Gerald was the head of chambers, a remote figure so far as Patricia was concerned, though he was universally described as jovial. She’d seen him coming and going; portly, untidy and energetic, with straggly black hair that usually looked like it needed washing. He had an improbable reputation as a ladies’ man. The memory Patricia carried of his physical appearance was of the damp stains that appeared around the armpits of his striped shirts on warm afternoons. As for talking to him, they had barely exchanged more than a few words.
Patricia assumed that he wanted to see her to congratulate her on finishing pupillage and being kept on. Probably this meeting was another tradition that she didn’t know anything about.
Gerald welcomed her into his room and made a point of brewing the tea himself. He used a cracked and ugly teapot with a part of the spout missing. She supposed it had a sentimental value. Gerald selected the least battered looking from a cluster of mugs that sat on a tin tray next to an electric kettle. He offered her sugar from a half empty bag and she declined, noting that the spoon had been used earlier. 
His room was not so different to others in the set, though better appointed. The furniture was older, grander, more ragged. Patricia knew that some of the other senior barristers wanted to modernize chambers, but Gerald was against it. There was a lot of talk just now about bringing the bar up to date. One day, she supposed, they might even have female heads of chambers. 
In Gerald’s view, which he was happy to explain to colleagues of whatever seniority, it was no bad thing for the bar to give the impression of being other worldly and a little eccentric. Damn it, he would say, we are other worldly and eccentric; it’s just that most of us don’t realize it. There should be something of the mad professor about us, or the wizard, better still. People are a little afraid of wizards; they get respect. 
But as Gerald would have it, a wizard, who breaks his staff, shaves regularly, buys himself a smart business suit and sits in a modern office; well he’s no more than a man of business. May as well be a solicitor. Then his younger colleagues would shake their heads and Gerald would fall back on the consolation of sentimentalists of all periods: I suppose it will all have to change but please god not in my time. 
Gerald spent some time explaining this view of things to Patricia, in his vague elliptical way. She knew Gerald’s reputation: that his long windedness was often the bait in a trap; that in a courtroom or a conference he was suddenly incisive when he chose his time to spring, breaking out of seeming indolence to make a telling point at exactly the right moment. Just now she found his manner infuriating. He was spinning out some anecdote beyond all reasonable expectation and there seemed to be no point to it at all.
Then he started to talk about the building, which was as time stained and indifferent to mere utility as its senior tenant could have wished. Patricia had the impression that he was repeating bits of conversation that he’d recently imparted to the other seniors. No response seemed to be required from her for the time being. Her attention started to wander as she thought about the structure of chambers; which struck her as a good analogy for the English legal system 
The building was a maze, a hotchpotch of rooms, vaguely connected by short corridors that intersected unpredictably with other corridors, and staircases that the builders seemed to have constructed at random. It was the sort of layout where in order to get across the building; you must first go up, then down and around. Ceilings and door frames were set at varying heights, so that the overall impression was not of a building at all, more a collection of separate rooms, piled on top of or alongside each other and loosely jointed in whatever way seemed convenient. 
Had it ever been a house, she wondered? As a novice in the labyrinth there were parts of the building that remained mysterious to Patricia. She was not sure that she could have pointed out the tiny window of her own mostly underground cupboard from outside the building, so complete was the disorientation once you began to navigate the internal arrangements. 
The unnatural complexity of the physical location added to the sense of unreality that she felt all the time at work; the dizzying notion that she did not belong, might never belong; that she was in a play where everyone except her knew the script, and every time she opened her mouth it was to betray her ignorance. Lately any period of reflection seemed to bring her to this point and then she would become enraged with frustration that she couldn’t let anyone see. It was all pointless rituals and hollow traditions, framed as a defence against outsiders.
She was angry with this world, and she was angry with herself for still wanting so badly to be part of it. The system was fusty and idiotic, but though she might allow that, it was not for anyone outside of the sanctum to say so, and already she felt the guilty pride of being an initiate, even as a novice. 
Now Gerald was approaching the obscure point of his monologue, such as it was. The burden of it seemed to be that wigs and gowns and rooms with a certain patina of age (or you could say dust) were what preserved society from a new barbarian age. Abruptly he changed tack.
-And you, er, Patricia. Settling in alright? Clerks looking after you?
-Yes, thank you. I’ve some work coming in. Only bits and pieces, but give it time, they say.
-Indeed. And I hear that your chap, what was his name?
-David.
-Yes, I hear David is a lawyer too, on the junior side of the profession. I was talking to Sammy Marks the other day, from Simpson Rose, and he was saying they have high hopes of David. Sammy was at your house the other night of course; very nice he said. Anyway, I hope, if you take my meaning, that should occasion arise, David knows that he would find our set very eager to assist him.
-I’ve told him that we offer a full service.
-Yes. Well perhaps you could afford to be a little more fulsome in your recommendation; without becoming vulgar. But in any case, I didn’t ask to see you to talk about that, and thanks for coming at short notice by the way. Something else entirely. Tell me what you remember about the Obuswu case.
Patricia struggled to make any connection to that name. 
-I see you don’t recall. So long ago. Well maybe that’s a good thing – new thinking for old history. The point is there’s going to be another inquiry; seven years after the event, I know. Don’t ask me how these things come about, maybe someone new comes along and reads the files, maybe they were waiting until everyone involved had died or moved on. Most likely it was hoped that everyone would forget about the whole thing, but that doesn’t seem to have happened for some reason. In any case, now it is up to you and me to discover the truth of it, eh?
-I don’t follow you.
-Yes, yes of course. Well I, for my part, have been asked to chair the inquiry, and there will be quite a lot of work. It needs a bright junior, so naturally I thought of you. I mean, I should say that a lot of it will be deadly dull, reading through box loads of files and interviewing witnesses, if we can find them, and if they can remember anything. It’s forensic work, not what you are used to. The main thing is that afterwards we must be able to show that we have left no stone unturned; followed every clue, so to speak. A lot of detail in short, and much of it tedious. However, all in a good cause and it is work with a certain prestige. The sort of thing that you can point to afterwards and say, I was involved in that. People will remember. Good for the profile, do you see? So I’ll put you down for coming on board?
-I suppose so, thank you.
-Good, that’s settled then. 
The rest of their chat was very genial, though it seemed to end quite quickly. Back in her underground hutch, Patricia mulled over the conversation. Why had she been chosen for this: was it a good thing or a bad? Of course, whichever it was, there had never been an option turning the job down. 

***

Patricia started to read through the case summaries. Over the days that followed she immersed herself in the case. The agreed facts were simple enough. 
There was not much to say about Mr Obuswu. He was a simple man, described as having learning difficulties. He had come to the city in the early seventies and hung around for a few months, sleeping rough wherever he could. He liked to drink and was not choosy about the quality of alcohol that came his way. One evening at the beginning of winter, he’d been taken into police custody after becoming unruly, and the next day he was found dead in his cell. The cause of death was internal injuries, but how they were suffered was not clear. 
In itself his was not such an extraordinary tale, but a combination of factors had stamped it into the public consciousness. Mr Obuswu was black of course, and even though he had no friends in the city, relations between the police and what was at that time called the immigrant community had been tense enough for the case to spark interest. The man’s death, and the apparent lack of official interest in it, confirmed what certain neighbourhoods routinely claimed; that they had good reason to suspect and fear the police. There had been demands for an independent inquiry, and some articles in the national press about the case. 
Mr Obuswu was vulnerable, without any history of aggression, and the pathology was consistent with his having been badly beaten. Trust became the issue: to many, this was a clear case of police violence, and if nothing could be done about such an obvious abuse then it was clear that no-one should not expect justice in any similar circumstance. When the official investigation made no progress, there was disappointment but not much surprise: it seemed that incidents like this would always be swept under the carpet, almost as a matter of routine. But all this had occurred seven years earlier. Were things any different now, Patricia wondered?
There was more detail.
From the pathologist’s report, it was clear that the body had suffered injuries consistent with an assault. “Serious and sustained” were the words he used. The statement of the arresting officer described some difficulties getting the victim into the police van, but nothing of particular significance. Of course what was described in a report, as a minor scuffle with a confused drunk might have been something quite different on the night, but how would anyone learn the truth of that now? 
The victim was not the only alcoholic derelict known to hang around in the churchyard, and some of the others could be violent, no doubt. The official view was that there had probably been a dispute about drink just before the arrest, and that had been when Mr Obuswu had suffered serious injuries, though he had not realized it at the time. He had some old bruises as well as the recent ones: maybe he’d been beaten before. In any case, later in the evening he wandered into town in search of another bottle. The police were called because he was shouting and did not seem able to walk. The report concluded that the arresting officers were just unlucky enough to pick up a man who had already been fatally injured. 
The official inquiry that eventually followed expressed mild criticism of the desk sergeant for not calling a doctor earlier. But it was a Friday night. You had to suppose there would be more than a few drunks in the cells complaining about not feeling well and probably not so many doctors eager to come out and examine them. 
Patricia knew from David that the police preferred to leave suspects in the cells till around two in the morning, either to give them time to calm down and sober up, or because of the way the shifts changed. At that time, the officers would have a look at each prisoner’s situation and conduct interviews where necessary. You got more sense out of them after a few hours in a cell, and it was just a bonus that this meant getting their lawyers out of bed in the middle of the night to attend the discussions. No one had been called out to represent Obuswu, probably because they had never intended to charge him.
The desk sergeant in the case was retired now. His statement didn’t include anything unusual, except that Obuswu had been interviewed that night by a detective investigating a different case, about an hour after he was brought in. David told her that it was standard practice for officers to persuade suspects in custody to ask for other offences to be taken into consideration, even if the suspects knew nothing about those offences. It boosted clear up rates and the suspect might hope for some favours in return. Probably the detective had wanted Obuswu to confess to some petty theft that had been unsolved for too long. It wasn’t a lengthy interview. No doubt the officer had given up trying to get any sense out of the alcoholic vagrant. 
Mr Obuswu had died from internal injuries, but according to the medical evidence, it was not possible to be certain when he suffered them. What it came down to was that someone gave him a kicking and he bled to death from the inside. Patricia noted that it would be worth challenging the pathologist’s reluctance to put a time on injury relative to the time of death, and to compare his conclusions with best practice at the time. It might be worth commissioning an expert review of the report on this basis, even at this late stage.
The desk log was maddeningly vague about the important things, and unfeasibly precise about minor details, in the way of official documents. It was recorded that various prisoners, including the victim, had been complaining at different points in the shift, and that they were attended to confirm that they were not in serious distress. The language was the same in each case. “Attended” could mean anything. You could attend someone with the toe of your boot if they were making too much noise. But the desk sergeant did not read like that sort. He’d have been middle aged already at the time, close enough to retirement, with a record as a steady type: only four more years to serve. David said that the bad custody officers were known to everyone: usually they were the younger ones, who were bored or resentful about the job. 
The desk sergeant had not been the only officer in the station, but anyone else would have needed to go through him to reach the cells. However, being an old hand, he might have been prepared to stretch the rules about recording any visits. It could have been that another officer was in the cell at some point without that fact having been noted. Perhaps the sergeant could be pressed to refresh his memory, if he was reassured first that his pension was not at risk. 
What about the detective? He was on record as having been in the cell. He’d declined to cooperate with the investigation, although that was easy enough to understand since the man had later been dismissed for financial irregularities. The notes were not specific about what kind of stealing was involved, and he’d not been charged. Perhaps, after all these years he might be prepared to talk, especially since this was not a police investigation. At least he might remember who else had been in the station that night. The desk sergeant’s memory was a little vague on that score. 
Patricia began the work of comparing the information available from the different sources, bristling with energy and full of righteous indignation; confident that she would find something buried in the records that needed to be brought to light. She had convinced herself that the fact that the case had resisted being consigned to oblivion for all these years meant that there was more to it than had been told in the official versions. There must have been a cover up. 
The amount of paper that had been generated over the years was surprising. They needed a separate room for all the boxes. There were the records of the internal inquiry by the police themselves as well as the witness statements the press cuttings and the station records. But there weren’t any obvious inconsistencies between them: in fact several of the witness statements had clearly been written by the same person using the same words for each witness. Even where this was not the case, the official language concealed more than it disclosed. 
It was maddening: the same trivial details repeated and repeated, and then when you reached the point where something useful might be said; silence. But at least there was an official version; something that was set down in writing and could be challenged, if only she could get at the facts that were buried under all these words.
Unfortunately, as the work progressed, she found nothing more than unconnected fragments; no pattern; no evidence of conspiracy. Somehow this made her more convinced than ever that there was a hidden version. That conviction, or maybe it was only wishful thinking; the feeling that someone was trying to fool her, was what kept her going. She re-interviewed the serving officers, uselessly. Their conversations were stiff and formal. The matters to be discussed had to be agreed with the men and their representatives in advance. The officers were defensive; resentful of ancient history being raked over once more; suspicious of Patricia and her motives; more as a matter of routine than because they seemed to have anything to hide. The men gave stock answers, that she could have written herself without bothering to ask the questions. 
Soon her initial burst of energy was dissipated and what remained was boxes and boxes of paper that had to be read through and catalogued somehow. 
She sent regular progress reports to Gerald in case he might want her to focus on any particular point, but they had barely spoken since he assigned her to the case. He seemed satisfied that their own files were building up and not at all dismayed by the absence of new evidence.  
The worst thing for Patricia was that she knew that the clerks were directing cases to the other juniors: cases that she felt should have come to her, if not for that she was fully employed churning paper for the inquiry. She had found no hidden treasure in the dusty papers, nothing that might make her name by shaping the course of the review, and now she doubted that she ever would. In the meantime she was slipping back in the race to be the clerks’ favourite junior.
Then she began to think for the first time that perhaps there was no smoking gun to be found. Maybe she had been wrong to believe that Gerald had put his trust in her because he had some trust in her abilities. It could be that he saw the work as pointless and just some profitable drudgery to hand out. She was the silly enthusiastic girl he’d found to grind out a minute examination of a case that was as dead as it could be but still chargeable by the hour.
Her sleep began to suffer as her belief began to fade. And still there was no escape. The boxes were there waiting for her every morning and somehow she knew, this thing had to be got through.

***

Like Patricia, Matthew had to get used to his share of boredom and humiliation in the world of work. It didn’t hurt him as much, since he was more inclined to believe that this was the natural order of things. And somehow, in spite of himself, the job started to feel more comfortable
Looking back, he’d admit that Richard, in his quiet way, and Ralph in his not so quiet way, taught him a lot, probably without knowing it. Just now, Matthew didn’t realize that he was being taught, or even that there were things he needed to know. In general terms he was painfully conscious of his inexperience, but specific ignorance made him more defensive than curious, at least in the moment. Afterwards he’d be furious with himself over the opportunities missed because of pride.
Finally, after he’d outlasted all expectation and Ralph had become accustomed to his presence, the day came when Ralph suggested that Matthew might accompany his lunchtime visit to the Town Hall Tavern. Matthew was delighted to accept, though he should have realised that being taken under Ralph’s wing would not be an unmixed blessing as regards Matthew’s relations with the management of the paper.
 Ralph had been with the business for longer than anyone could remember. He made his own rules, that management were wary of challenging, on the basis that none of the current bosses could be sure what personal indulgences their predecessors might have granted to him. 
In fact, Ralph would not have described himself as an employee of the paper at all. In his mind, he owned the Examiner fully as much as he was owned by it. The ink of its press flowed in his veins. He guarded his privileges jealously and sought to extend them at any opportunity, as much to thwart the despised businessmen who thought they managed the paper as for personal convenience. The result was that he was regarded with impotent suspicion by management. 
As Ralph’s designated friend, Matthew enjoyed the summons that came most days to join Ralph in the pub for what he liked to call an editorial conference. Although they were inseparable in the office, Richard didn’t share these expeditions, but since Ralph was a senior reporter, no-one could object to Matthew staying as long as he was told to do so.
Although Mr Elliott couldn’t easily object, he watched and made clear that he did not approve. When the two of them eventually stumbled back to the office, occasion would be found to let Matthew know that his behaviour was proving a disappointment, and that Ralph was not the best person for him to associate with. As a writer, Elliott allowed, the old chap was first class, not a word could be said against him, but as an example that was a different matter. If Matthew wanted to get on, he should realize that men like Ralph; difficult types who caused trouble, were the past. 
Matthew wasn’t interested in getting on and he couldn’t imagine that there were so many men like Ralph. He liked to pretend that he didn’t care what Elliott thought. On the other hand he didn’t want to put his job at risk. He knew that he wouldn’t easily find another one that was so congenial. Sometimes he did become concerned that he was taking too many liberties, and that he would be found out. On the other hand, every journalist he’d met and thought he could respect seemed indifferent to office discipline. Besides he reasoned, if he was going to take Mr Elliott´s advice seriously, he may as well have gone straight from university to banking or accountancy, like everyone else. 
Mr Elliott was more inclined to preach than praise. He made it clear that there was something about young Matthew´s manner that he didn’t approve of. Matthew was prone to depression at the best of times. He began to suspect that Elliott was planning to be rid of him. Unusually, Ralph noticed there was something wrong. He generously offered to share his own wisdom on the subject of employment. Since it was almost lunchtime, he suggested that the conversation would flow better in the pub. 
The bar was crowded. Ralph was in an expansive mood. He continued the monologue he’d begun earlier as he shouldered his way to the bar and returned, more quickly than seemed feasible, with two pint glasses brimming with beer.
-Matthew, think of this afternoon as my symposium, which I want to begin today by telling you about politics 
-I’m not much interested in politics anymore.
-How so? Drink up.
-I mean, I used to think it was important. I still read the papers and everything. Before Thatcher I used to think that politics was a way to change things: so that everything would be fairer. I’m not talking about college; everything seemed childish there. I mean further back; ideas from home. My mum has strong ideals, I suppose. 
-Matthew, sometimes when you speak, everything comes out at once and you make no sense at all. Now you sound like a doubting young priest. What happened to make you lose your faith?
-It was the election. I know Labour was exhausted and useless, but people voted the other lot in out of greed and self interest, or what they thought was self interest. That’s the other side of it; once working people lose conviction and a sense of sharing, it turns out you can make them believe anything. The rich tell the not rich what to think and bribe them with their own money to keep quiet while the future is sold off cheap.
Ralph gave a wry smile. Given the strange physiognomy of his face, the effect was grotesque. 
-Oh, I see. You felt solidarity with the working man until you decided that the working man had let you down by disagreeing with you. A familiar story I believe.
-I think the truth is that people of all classes are mostly not worth caring about. They’re only interested in getting even a little bit more for themselves, maybe buying a house cheap to sell it at a profit, or making a few pounds when the government sells off what the people used to own. They keep smiling as everything that was shared is wrecked or given away. And the more they get, the less they want to help the people at the bottom, only because they feel that bit further on from the bottom themselves. The messages they hear are lies, but they’re only taken in because they want to believe the lies. 
Ralph smiled again. His glass seemed to empty itself. You didn’t notice him drinking before it was time for a refill.
-A fascinating digression Matthew. Thank you for your insight. However the kind of polity I have in mind for today is office politics. We are not concerned with a critique of the overrated system of democracy and its many failings. We are more concerned with the practical matter of the struggle for survival and advancement in the workplace. It is not the lofty rhetoric of the Republic, but the sordid intrigues of Empire, that concern us now. The scale of events is not so grand of course, but you may find that the ruthlessness and depravity involved is comparable with the antique Romans. However before we commence I think that it would be in order to recharge these glasses. Your shout, I think. 
When Matthew returned from the bar, still wondering what Ralph was talking about, his friend took a long pull at his fresh pint before continuing.
- The politics of work, Matthew, are like the general kind. They affect your life; even should you, ill-advisedly, choose to ignore them. 
-You say that, but I don’t see you paying any attention to what is going on at work, or who‘s arguing with who. 
-They may argue with whom they choose. And have you considered that my ignorance of these spats may be assumed? Perhaps I am more a Claudius, than you know. Remember the supposed idiot outlived all those ambitious types who were so desperate to be emperor. But we are talking of yourself not me. The crux is, what must you know to survive and prosper? Which is to ask, not so much what you need to know of the profession of journalism, because any fool can master the few tricks you’ll want for that trade, but rather the more problematic issue of the life and how one may best enjoy it in an age of ignorance.
He drank deeply.
-Think about this. People are not always what they seem, and neither need you be. Take, for example our esteemed colleague Richard.  Richard, you know, comes from a family of mill owners. For ever so long his grandfather was mayor of one of those godforsaken Pennine towns that no one ever visits. In short, his family is rich.
-He seems alright.
-As why should he not? But to return to my theme, you were about to comment that you thought that I was the posh one in the office.
-I was?
-Indeed, whereas in fact it was Richard who enjoyed a privileged youth, including a time at Cambridge in the long ago, where he no doubt witnessed, and for all I know participated in that debauched undergraduate behaviour which we read of in the contemporary fiction of the time. And yet to hear him speak now, you would think he’d been a blunt Yorkshire tyke all his life.
-And you Ralph?
I’m afraid that my formal education terminated abruptly at the age of fifteen. Thereafter you might say I became something of an autodidact, until a chance involuntary sojourn in Her Majesty’s armed forces provided the opportunity to formally better myself. More night school than gilded academia for me. I might add, if it needs saying, that I am sharing information with you on a strictly need to know basis. Chatham House Rule applies.
Matthew had no idea what rule Ralph meant. Rather than show his ignorance, he asked why it was important that he should receive this information. 
-We were talking earlier, were we not, about what management like to call your appraisal?
-If that’s what it was. You mean, when I told you that Mr Elliot said that he feared I would never be worldly enough to make a proper newspaperman?
-His comment seemed to make you unhappy.
-I like it at the paper, I feel comfortable.
-Well then that’s more than halfway to you being a true newspaperman isn’t it? Tell me, what in particular do you feel comfortable? Always specifics remember. We never content ourselves with odious generalities.
-If I’m honest: I like sitting around with time to think, making up stories – I don’t mean inventing, I mean turning some facts into a story, I like it that people leave me alone, and having time to come out like now for a drink in the day.
-Well and if you’d told old Elliot that, he would have to agree that you are a natural born hack in all vital aspects.
-Unworldly, he said.
-Well, boy, how would you describe me? Would you say I was worldly?
-It’s different for you Ralph, you’re… larger than life.
-You’re quite hopeless. If you had spent any time reading Plato, or any of the Greeks, instead of - whatever you did read – you would appreciate the fallacy of your position. We are agreed that I am no more worldly than you, and yet I have been a newspaperman over the course of some two decades, as the payroll of the Examiner will attest. Ergo, worldliness, with whatever grubby association Johnson intended to imbue that unlovely word, is not an essential requisite of the job. You should also have noted, if you had been paying attention, that in the matter of my being larger than life, the persona that I present to the world, being, I like to fancy, that of an erudite sage, disinterested to a fault, rather aristocratic even, I could go on – in any case it should be clear to you that, even if this is the part I was born to play, I was not born playing it.
Matthew’s face failed to display the expression of sudden enlightenment that Ralph had been expecting.
-I can hardly put it more simply for you, Matt. Practice dissimulation. Choose a character, become that person and things will go very well for you afterwards. Anyone can collect facts. The skill is to make something of them. How many times have I told you that?
-But this is life we’re talking about. You make it sound like acting. Is that really what I should do for the rest of my life? Pretending all the time, just to fit in. I remember talking about that once. I said that was how everyone of my generation would end.
-And every generation before and since. Nothing unique about it. We say the lines until they become us. And actors are we all, that rise thus nimbly by our daily scrawl.
-I know that one, it’s Shakespeare.
-It was a paraphrase not a quotation; remind me to explain the difference. For now, think only that an actor must play many parts, while I am suggesting that you need master only one, and consider that the part that you play is your own invention. I should add that you are not doomed to tread the boards of life as the tiresomely ignorant, blank-faced boy I see before me. Only one word more: I would only caution you, seriously; do not willingly play the grocer. Don’t become like that fool Elliot, The likes of you and I should steer clear of…commerce, or worse still management. 
The words made Ralph grimace as if his beer had suddenly turned sour.
Matthew knew, or hoped he knew, that Ralph’s insults were offered in a kindly way. He did not take offence at being called ignorant and blank-faced, not least because he felt the description was justified. He considered Ralph’s advice, while his companion drained his glass and offered it to Matthew with an unspoken invitation that it be refilled.
-Ralph, it must have taken years for you to read all the books you know and to turn yourself into the person you are now; to understand so much about really posh people and how they live.
-But reading books was what I always wanted to do, so it wasn’t work to me. And I took a lot of it from Wodehouse, which is not exactly hard going. In any case, he added, shaking the empty glass at Matthew to indicate that a refill was now overdue: the main thing is attitude. People will take you at your own estimation with just a few props and a little conviction. Believe me I know whereof I speak.  

***

The Obuswu inquiry dragged on without any obvious progress. For Patricia it was a slow time that didn’t become easier to bear when David made partner at his firm. 
He was very young: to some he was still newly qualified. On the other hand, no one could claim surprise. Although the partners hated to share equity, especially with one who had not served his time, they had realized that it was a choice between making him up and losing him to another firm. The difficult part for David had been to help them see that without making them feel like they had guns to their heads. To make partner early was unusual, but to do so without making too many enemies was rare indeed. 
By his own admission, David was no better than average as a lawyer, but he did have a knack of making each client feel that he had only their interests at heart. Even when he failed to return their calls they didn’t hold it against him. He wouldn’t blame his office for failing to pass on messages, as others routinely did, but somehow he was able to give clients the impression that he was accepting personal responsibility only because he was too much of a gentleman to point a finger at whoever had really let them down. 
According to David, his lack of interest in the law as a discipline made him better at the job. He wanted to find practical solutions to his clients’ difficulties, regardless of technical niceties. In a negotiation, he would start modestly, appearing to yield to his opponent’s legal analysis of the situation; perhaps pointing out the one or two areas of doubt that he might bring up later. It was only after the deal was done that his opponent would wonder why his own client had made so many concessions if their case was really that strong. David could sense when the opposition was likely to be made more tractable by having its pride massaged.
His personal charm was all the more potent for seeming to be employed without calculation. Unfortunately charm was not always enough. There were all kinds of lawyers. The worst were those who capitalised on their own notoriety, trusting that their well known intransigence and blind self absorption would force the other side to despair of agreeing a reasonably fair outcome and concede. These were the self-made monsters who demanded and obtained surrender on the basis that everyone knew it was the only way to avoid excessive damage to the interests and pockets of both sides. Although some clients were as bad, when it was more important to them that their lawyer should be seen to be unreasonably aggressive than that their case should succeed. 
It was clear that psychology was more important than logic in the supposedly hard boiled world of commerce. David had a grudging respect for the mad dogs. They were all about winning. Often they knew every statute and every procedural twist; and they were completely indifferent to their clients’ best interests. Their approach reminded him of the American president who persuaded the Russians that he was crazy enough to press the button. When he came up against this type he’d often need to advise his client to see the case as a ransom demand that had to be paid. It couldn’t be denied that the mad dog approach got results, but then so did David. The difference was that his clients came back next time. 
The clients were important. Even more important were David’s dealings with other professionals and contacts; the men who passed the clients on to him. Business development, they liked to call it. David brought in business, which meant that he was fishing at the head of the stream. If he left, the firm would lose some fish, but worse than that, the source would dry up. That was why they needed to keep him happy.
How or why the business contacts came to be so close to David so quickly was difficult to comprehend, but the partners were practical men, not minded to deny the world as it was. In a bigger firm, the issue of status might have been more important than the monthly income that was being billed, but Simpson Rose, for all its pretension, was just of a size for the bottom line to be sovereign. This being so; David’s claim was unanswerable.

***

It was round about this time that David developed an enthusiasm for hill walking; which surprised Matthew for various reasons. 
-After all you said about your father and his hiking boots.
David affected not to remember any such conversation. Matthew thought of reminding him about the tale of the mysterious lost cottage, which had not been heard for a while, but he knew that story would never be a joking matter so far as David was concerned. 
-It’s the one time I can be with my own thoughts and no interruptions, David said.
-What about that gadget you have, can’t they reach you with that?
-The mobile telephone you mean? There’s no signal on the hills and anyway I wouldn’t carry that thing with me. It’s the size of a brick and it weighs more. Useless really; just one of those businessmen’s toys that everyone is mad to have until the craze passes.
-I’m amazed you have the time for hiking anyway.
-There’s time for everything if you make it.
Inevitably, it was not long before Matthew became a co-opted accomplice; a duty he didn’t so much object to, though he would have been reluctant to admit it. He understood what David meant when his friend talked of finding a rhythm of movement that let his thoughts drift where they would. Most times they didn’t say much after the first twenty minutes: there was no need. Matthew found that he didn’t look at landscape so much as unconsciously experience it, except there was something truly out of the ordinary to see; Yorkshire sunshine for example. 
Sometimes they did pause to admire the view and then they’d chat. One day, they were walking quite close to home: testing a short stretch of a long distance path that David was planning to complete one day when there was more time. This day, as usual he was pressed, but you would not know it in the quiet calm of the country.
-So tell me what I am looking at, Matthew demanded, breaking the comfortable silence.
-On a day like today, David replied, you see it all. Behind us to the east, that’s Almscliffe Crag, I suppose you know. That’s more or less where the hills give out and then across the plain you can see the North York Moors rising in the distance, looking as if they’re floating in the haze. West, up the valley that’s broad and flat because it’s Wharfedale, that mast you can see is Norwood Edge and beyond that Beamsley Beacon that looks down on Bolton Abbey. You have the best view of Ilkley moor from that side. We’re just on the edge of the Dales here. You don’t have to look at anything in particular. The country’s not an art gallery. Wouldn’t you say it’s more about feeling this particular day? The balance of the light that’s always shifting a little, the difference in the breeze, the pale sky. It just is. You bring your own thoughts out here. It doesn’t tell you what to think. 
-Very poetic. I expected more of a geography lesson
-You shouldn’t knock geography. I know you always thought of it as a good subject for boys who weren’t clever enough for other things, but at least it taught me some things that were worth remembering after the exam.
-I don’t remember saying anything against geography, Matthew sniffed. Anyway, it’s nice to be away from the world that was made by people. Why is that funny?
-All of this landscape was made by people. The Bronze Age settlers came to hills where the forest was thin enough to clear when they made the first farms: that’s what made the Dales. After that, civilisation flowed down these valleys like melting ice. Then Roman roads, and later on pack horse routes set the lines of these paths we have through the hills; straight and winding; bringing salt from the coast and whatever else was needed. You can read the story of it on the map if you know what to look for. Look there – Psalter’s Gate, you see that everywhere – gate meaning a way. It was for the salters, nothing to do with psalms. When I have time, I like to look at maps and read the past from them. 
-Ah, so now the geography lesson. 
-Well, there are stories everywhere. Look at that name, Ben Rhydding. Sounds Celtic doesn’t it? Not very Yorkshire. Where do you think that comes from?
-I suppose you know.
-It’s a made up name, romantic sounding to attract Victorians to the Spa that someone had built there. I think it was called Fairley before. There has been bullshit as long as there have been people, Matt. It’s a shame you let it upset you so much.
They lapsed into silence, but neither seemed eager to be on their way. On the hill, the day was calm. The only sound was the flies vaguely buzzing, as if they were about to fall asleep. Above them, the winds were stronger. Clouds of brilliant white skidded across the sky, changing the pattern of light and shade across the valley every few moments.
-My mother sees the story of the land differently, Matthew said.
-What does she say about it?
-She claims it’s the same story in every place, only the details change. Men and women start to grow crops and tend animals where they find soil that will stand it. Others preferred to live by stealing what they produce. Both sides develop their technologies, the farmers to grow more and the thieves to steal more effectively: wheeled machinery and domesticated cattle to pull it for one lot, sharp weapons and fast horses for the other.
David nodded. Matthew continued.
-Then, some of the robbers realize that they might do better offering the farmers protection from other robbers, in return for a share of the produce. That way they’ll have plunder every year, and not be constantly looking for new farms to rob. These thieves settle down and become kings, dukes and earls. Soon they forget how they started. Their old skills aren’t much use. They recruit a new class of clever people to do their thinking for them. The clever people have various jobs, but most importantly they have to make the farmers understand why it is so important that the established, titled robbers remain in charge. Of course the kings and dukes and earls have always to be on their guard against unlicensed thieves who might want to move in on their space, which is how laws start. 
-Your mother said all that?
-She didn’t say it all at once but yes; she says polite society is a protection racket with manners. You know she’s fairly quiet normally but once she gets going you get the full story. I’ve only given you the summary. She talks about the industrial revolution in the same way. She describes a factory as a machine with metal parts and human parts that depends upon the human parts being persuaded to give up their humanity. She explained how Victorian industrialists around here became the uncrowned kings of their small city states. They gave themselves made up titles like the old robbers had done; city fathers, and aldermen. She’s full of ideas like that.
David took out a flask from his back pack and unscrewed the cap.
-Do you want tea? There’s milk but no sugar.
-Thanks.
-It’s going to rain later on, or tomorrow at latest.
-Probably.
Matthew drained the cup and handed it back to David, who poured tea for himself into the same cup. 
-You’ll have to tell me what you believe yourself one day Matt.
-Why does it matter what I believe?
-It should matter to you. How are you supposed to understand the world and give it meaning if you don’t believe in something?
-Maybe the world doesn’t have meaning.
-I knew that’s what you would say, but you’re wrong. And even if you were right, that would mean it was up to us to invent the best meaning we could find for it, don’t you think?
Matthew didn´t reply. Each of them sipped tea for a moment, lost in his own thoughts. 
-Tell me one thing at least, David continued. You spend so much time pondering on life; you must have an opinion about this. 
-Fire away.
-Do you believe in redemption? I don´t mean the religious kind. I mean, if somebody did something quite bad, let themselves down as a human being, but afterwards they did a lot of good; maybe even spent the rest of their life trying to help other people. Don´t you think that the good they did would make up for the bad? 
-That´s a strange question to ask me just now. I suppose I think that for me the good would more than make up for the bad. But probably for that person it would depend on them and how they ended up feeling about themselves. To feel redeemed they’d have to learn to forgive themselves for whatever went wrong. I suppose that´s why criminals find god when they are in jail; it lets them pretend that someone else has pardoned them. When I was younger my mother did that for me. Children don’t do anything so terrible but they often need pardoning.
-I never had my mother there for that.
Once more, Matthew cursed himself for his insensitivity and the way he had of treating every comment about life as if it were an exam question, never thinking about the human context before he opened his mouth. He was too embarrassed to ask David why he had raised such a strange question.
The good thing about being out here was that you could pick up the thread of a conversation twenty minutes after you started it, or drop the subject entirely. For now they only needed to watch the clouds rolling overhead, and the subtle changes of light and shade in the valley below them. David seemed lost in his thoughts of who knows what, and Matthew was content to let his own conscious thoughts drain away, to be no more than in the landscape and a part of it.
Chapter Three

The winter snow tormented Belfast: it was the sort that blew in on a frozen wind and lashed your face with its dampness. Snow that couldn´t decide whether to settle or thaw; that would never look clean or even vaguely white, only grey. The grey bled into everything, draining any colour there might have been from the night time city and sky. 
Although he was from a northern city himself, Sergeant Raymond Hawkins hated this sort of weather. After this tour, that´s it, he promised himself. No signing up for another three years. Whatever happens next, I’m going somewhere warm. 
Falling snow deadened sound, which was good, but probably made it easier for him to be followed. For the moment his main concern was to keep the car pointing in the right direction. There’d been no gritters again and the roads were treacherous. It would not do to end up sideways on and having to ask for help in this neighbourhood. It would not do at all. 
Hawkins was good at only worrying about one thing at a time. Even so, he was fairly sure that he was being followed, which was stupid of them, since they knew where he was going. The meeting place was their choice, not his. The question in his mind was; where had he been followed from? He’d met one of the go-betweens in a bar earlier, but if they had been shadowing him before that, then the situation later on would quickly become embarrassing. 
The designated meeting place was a club on one of those loyalist housing estates where there were UVF flags on all the lampposts, faded and hanging in tatters but still there because it was more than your life was worth to remove them. Giant murals: crude paintings of masked men holding automatic rifles daubed on the gable ends of houses, same tired old graffiti on the walls. It was grim and exhausted, like the city itself so far as Hawkins was concerned. He suspected that most people wanted to jack in all this troubles crap and get on with their lives. Only the arguments were like the flags, they´d been hanging over everyone so long until they were just bits of dirty rag, torn and meaningless but impossible to get rid of. 
And of course there was always somebody making a good living out of a bad situation like this. 
He drove once past the club, slowly, before he parked the car. It looked fairly lively, in the sense that there were people coming and going outside, though none of them were going so far as to smile. They were shadows, with faces that came to life briefly as they passed into the sodium glare of the main door lighting. Above them, a string of electric lights had been stretched across the facade under the eaves, shining weak defiance at the bleak December evening. Pinpricks of red, white and blue; the only colours around.  The club itself was ugly enough; brick built and practically windowless, more like a place to be defended than a place to meet. He could imagine men getting drunk in there, but not in a happy way.
There was a line of parked cars in the street. Hawkins found a gap in the line that would accommodate his vehicle, far enough away from the streetlights. He waited and watched. In a moment he spotted the headlights of another car that was coming to a halt in one of the side streets opposite. Sure enough, it was him. He saw the shadow of the driver getting out of the car and moving in the direction of the club, but no-one appeared at the end of the street, though the driver had not gone into any of the houses. The driver’s shadow had simply disappeared.
The passenger side door of his own car was in darkness. Hawkins eased that door open and slid out gently, making sure that his figure did not show above the level of the car roof. Then, gently and quietly, he pushed the door closed. Without making another sound, he lowered himself to the ground and began to crawl down the line of cars. This filthy snow will ruin these clothes, he thought. The foul night was beginning to irritate him.
When he’d slipped into a little alley that ran parallel to where the shadow had been he began to walk normally. He went down the alley and came around the far end of the side street, so that he was looking back towards the club. He walked down the road, past the car that had arrived just after him. The driver was pressed into a doorway still watching Hawkins’ car intently.  Hawkins was close enough to see that the man had an unlit cigarette pressed between his lips. He was dying for a smoke, probably. You’ve been watching my car for twenty minutes, and I’ve been watching you for fifteen, was what he might have said to the man. But in fact he didn’t say anything, just took him down from behind like on the training ground: no problem. The stamp on his head after wasn’t in the manual, but Hawkins added that flourish on account of the stressful times and disgusting weather. 
Billy was sitting alone, near the door; waiting for him to show up Hawkins supposed. There didn’t seem to be anyone with him. Probably he didn’t feel like he needed anyone else, if it came to it. You could say that everyone in the place was with him, plus he thought he had his own man outside. Ray considered ways to play the situation. As usual, what came to mind was direct and to the point. 
He marched in and straight up to the table. Billy stood up, probably intending to greet him. Ray stepped in really close, hopefully so close that no one would see his right arm extended a little as if to shake. Instead he made a clenched fist and drove it, pivoting at the elbow, up past Billy’s chin and into the underside of his nose. 
It was not such a powerful blow but it caused shock. Billy staggered and Ray put an arm round his shoulder pulling him on and unobtrusively planting his knee into the inviting target of the man’s undefended groin. 
-Whoah there, Bill, looks like you’ve had more than enough for one evening, he said in a loud, cheerful voice; let’s walk outside a little and get your head clear.
Whether anyone was fooled there was no time to judge. Speed was half of the battle. No one stopped them as Ray walked Billy down the side street, towards the car that had been tailing him. He noticed that the driver’s body lay as he’d he left it. Good. He punched Billy a few more times in the kidneys and pulled the man’s overcoat down around his arms: that would make it more difficult for him to move, but still, mustn’t forget he’s a dangerous one. Next he opened the passenger door and shoved Billy in. 
-Look at this, your man has left the keys in. Very obliging of him. I suppose you have people looking out for my car, so we’ll leave it here for now. If I don´t collect it in the morning, your boys can keep whatever the street rats leave of it
Billy wasn’t saying anything. Hawkins showed him the gun. 
He made the drive as short as possible to a place that he thought was outside of hostile territory and deserted, and then it was time to talk. 
-Tell me the story Billy. There’s something badly wrong here. I make a friendly offer to sell you all that stuff you say you need. No rubbish. Armalites, nine millimetres and plenty of rounds. But then you arrange the meet in a place where we could never make the trade and it turns out you’ve got someone waiting outside for me. And I find out he’s carrying this crappy pistol, with a cheap looking silencer on it. I was forced to assume that your intentions were not friendly. 
-You’re no arms dealer, Captain whatever your name is, you’re a fucking para. 
-You could be right, though this arms dealing seems like easy work when you get into it. Maybe I should give it a try. Learning on the job is the best way to start, they say. I’m not Captain anybody though. They don’t send commissioned officers to deal with low level scum like you. I’m only a sergeant. And tell you what, I volunteered for this as well. Can you believe it? What could I have been thinking of? 
-We know all about you
-So I’m not as clever as I thought. But here I am and there you are, and what does that make you? Anyway I’ll be out of this shit tip in a few weeks, I’ve done my time
-You won’t ever have done your time as far as I’m concerned.
-Rash words. And by the way Billy, I know your real name. Couldn’t you have chosen an alias that was less orange?
-You’ll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your sad life mister
-Well I’ll not be looking for you at least
He shot the man in the spine, then dragged him out of the car and put two more in the head. Orders were to observe only, and if appropriate to detain for questioning, but so far as Hawkins could see this was a war, which meant that they weren’t orders so much as guidelines. By all accounts most of the loyalists hated Billy as much as the Provos did, and with reason, so it was not likely he’d be missed, and fortunately the weapon couldn’t be traced back to Ray.
All in all, a good night’s work, except that now he had to dump the car and take the long walk home, in the freezing cold through the watery bloody snow. 

***

Just before the war got properly started, Matthew got a call to meet Tim after work. They hadn’t spoken for a while, but he knew that Tim’s life was chaotic as always. He was finished with the service, but since escaping the army he’d been in no hurry to start anything else. Tim’s excuse was that he didn’t want to end up like his dad, who’d moved the whole family away from their home in Wales to work for a Manchester firm. His father had been fifteen years in the company before they made him redundant. Now he was on the dole, without a chance of a decent job, living in a place where he had no roots. 
Tim never said much about it, but they knew that the father had suffered some kind of breakdown and found it difficult to set foot outside the house. Tim blamed it on the family uprooting, but so far as Matthew could see it was Tim himself who was most in need of ties. At some point in his teens he had become a patriotic Welshman, though he’d only set foot in the principality on day trips to Llandudno. He seemed to think that if it were not for the family moving house, he would have been living in an imagined Celtic paradise where everyone was his friend and all his weekends would be spent singing his heart out at Cardiff Arms Park, drinking and complaining about the English. It was a dream of home that could only be sustained by permanent exile.
Tim had been drinking before Matthew arrived. He had kept his army haircut, which made him look more aggressive than at college: a loud little man with a big nose and short hair. People who didn’t know him, and some who did, tended to keep their distance. 
-You took your time.
-Some of us have to work for a living.
-But not you, you’re a journalist. That means you live in a pub, right? 
Matthew let it pass. 
-Is tonight a big night or an ordinary night? He asked.
-Big night.
-What are we celebrating? 
-I got my call up today. Back to join my mates in the Welsh Guards boyo.
-Don’t boyo me, you Manc Taff. What are you talking about?
-There’s going to be a war, haven’t you heard?
-You mean the Malvinas?
-I mean the bloody Falkland Islands. One of Her Majesty’s territories isn’t it? Don’t give me Malvinas.
-Well you talk as if Wales was an occupied country, so I’m surprised to hear that your sympathies are with the Empire. Anyway, what has it got to do with you? You’re finished with all that.
-Reservist mate, they don’t let you off that easy. They can still call on us when the country has need. Like bloody King Arthur in his tomb we are. Get me a pint, heroes don’t buy their own. 
But Matthew had become serious. 
-Tim, they can’t make you go. I mean you can’t go.
-Now I don’t understand you. 
-This war, if it happens. It won’t happen, it’s too stupid. But if it does: there’s no justification for it. You know those Argentine generals just want to fight someone to divert attention from the mess they made of their country. And Maggie Thatcher wants war for the same reason. It would be, well, immoral. And there’s nothing there but some sheep and a few crazy farmers who don’t want to learn Spanish. It’s just some rock off the coast of South America, thousands of miles away from us. 
-The Argentines want the islands badly enough.
-Well let them have them, if they feel so strongly. It’s not a war for that: it’s only to keep a conservative government in office, all wrapped up in the Union Jack like Winston bloody Churchill. 
Tim at least heard him out without interruption.
-I don’t know about any of that, but even if you were right, it wouldn’t make any difference. I’m still a soldier. You don’t ask questions like that and you don’t let your mates down. What do you want me to do - give them a call and say sorry lads; I’m sitting this one out? My mate says this war is no good, but I’ll be with you for the next one provided it’s one we approve of. It’s like any time when someone gives you an order; if you stop to argue about whether it’s the right one, somebody gets killed. A soldier has to do what the next man up the chain tells him, or everything falls apart.
-You’re no soldier Tim. You’ve said as much yourself. That’s not your nature. It’s killing or being killed, not some game. It might be you who gets killed, have you thought about that?
-I might be killed crossing the road when I leave this pub. I might die of thirst before you buy me another bloody pint. Anything could happen. And I’m a soldier. I’ve got a gun and a uniform like the others. What do you think is the nature of most of them?
There was no point arguing so they drank themselves stupid instead. The next day Matthew went down to the station to see Tim off. He was wearing uniform, though he said that some little tosser would probably spit at it or say something that was out of order. Bring it on, he said. He didn’t look as hung over as Matthew felt, but neither of them had much to say. If David had been there he would have found the right words, but as he was in London working on some deal there were just the two of them together with the awkward silences that each hoped the other understood.  
Matthew was upset for days afterwards. He couldn’t even explain to David why it had all hit him so hard, and that inability gave him a superstitious dread that something bad was going to happen. He couldn’t even express his thoughts, as if for fear that to do so might make them come true. 
His consolation was the unreality of it all. Matthew couldn’t believe that at this stage in history, the end of the twentieth century, two civilised countries would make war on each other over something as trivial as who had the biggest flag. Certainly the crisis would to come to nothing. There would be a few weeks of nationalistic posturing with negotiations going on quietly behind the scenes, and then a peaceful resolution that pleased no-one. But even so, in the part of him that was not amenable to such reason, the sense of dread remained. 

***

Tim remembered the next few weeks as mostly boring: stuck on a boat all that time; moving, but really in the same place, and with the same people. It was incredible that people paid to go on holidays like this, though they would have a bit more room, probably. All the panic to get ready before they sailed; and then it was such a long way and nothing to do in the meantime. The on-board conditions were cramped and there was no privacy, but he was with his mates so he didn´t mind that too much. Worse was that there was plenty of time to spend wondering why he was there at all. 
They all heard enough of what was going on in the world to know that the make believe war was drifting towards a real conflict. The talking was going nowhere, and all the while, slowly but inexorably, they were getting closer to the physical point of no return, where talking stopped and the momentum of events would take over. It seemed to Tim like a strange nightmare, a battle of wills between two equally petulant children. Neither had anything to gain, but both were unwilling to lose face. The men told each other that there was some undeclared reason why a piece of rock in the South Atlantic might be worth them dying for. Oil reserves or something as valuable must lie in the territorial waters. But regardless of the reason, if you believed them, the men could not wait to see action. It was a stupid eagerness but Tim was not immune to it, though he was one of those who argued that a peaceful outcome to the mission was most likely. Now that the Argentines had seen their bluff called they would back down.
-We’re like the Grand Old Duke of York and his men, he said. We march up to the top of the hill and we march back down again. By the time we get there, the politicians will have sorted it out. 
-Better for us, said one of the other junior officers. I don’t mind marching back when it could be a bloody long drop down the other side of the hill. 
But whatever they said between themselves, when Tim thought about the size of the deployment that they had only glimpsed when leaving England and what it must have cost, he couldn’t see how they could be recalled without a fight. The nearer they came to their destination, the further away a peaceful outcome seemed.
Who knew what the other officers were thinking, behind all the smiles?  Most of them seemed to be as desperate as the men to see action. Tim supposed that it was from all the time they had spent training, never expecting to do the job for real, and now it didn’t seem so childish or like they were only  pretending. All of them, himself included, got excited thinking and talking about it. Matthew and David would have laughed out loud if they could hear some of the things he had said.
If it´s a phony war, he thought, then I suppose we can brag and boast all we like: and if it´s not then we´ll find out soon enough. But still I look around this ship and I know I don’t really belong. I’ve done the training, but I´m here on false pretences. It was only the money I wanted, not to be a soldier. I suppose I shall do my duty, but will it show? Calm down. Just keep steady and don’t let anyone down. 
But then again, he noticed that most of them, even the shouters and brawlers, had some quiet moments, just sitting on their own; or as near as you could be to on your own in this floating sardine can. You noticed it more the further south they sailed. 
That was the real problem on a boat: too much time to think.

***

While the task force maintained its steady progress towards the islands, further to the south, the cruiser ARA General Belgrano (formerly USS Phoenix) accompanied by two destroyers, was making way easily on a calm sea at a good rate of knots. The light winds offered no cause for concern, although the forecast threatened deteriorating weather by close of day.
In other times it would be a joy to be at sea on a day like today, but now Captain Bonzo’s thoughts were fixed on the action that they seemed certain to face soon; even though he knew that, for the moment he was out of range of the British aircraft carrier. He had no suspicion that a British submarine had been shadowing them for the last three days, but he was painfully aware at all times that his ship was in a theatre of war. A threat could come unexpectedly from any direction. 
-It’s always the same. The generals send us to be killed, and afterwards no-one can remember why.
He knew that some of his officers were frustrated by the futility of it. Of course the other ranks were full of enthusiasm, as they should be; and none of his officers would dream of discussing their doubts, even between themselves. The Captain was confident that they would all do their duty whatever happened; even the new young men. You could see it in their eyes: this was their ship, and they loved her as sailors must.
However, a captain must not let his love of ship blind him. He must be aware of her weaknesses too. She was old and she was vulnerable: he was particularly concerned about attacks from the air. Without those Sea Cat missile launchers they would be sitting ducks for aircraft. He only hoped that they lived up to the promises of the Englishmen who sold them to his government. The helicopters must be kept operational too: much depended on that.
Still, she was a lucky ship. The Japanese had not managed to wound her at Pearl Harbour, and she had the reputation of being unsinkable: a reputation that would more than probably be put to the test. 
He was aware of all kinds of talk aboard ship; rumours flying at every level. Everyone was nervous: it was normal. The British would back down: they were afraid to fight and not prepared to risk their ships. The Americans would insist on a negotiation. Some of the junior officers believed that the navy’s ships would not be attacked if they remained outside the imaginary exclusion zone that some British admiral had drawn on a map: as if war was a game, like soccer, that you played within the context of a marked out field. All kinds of nonsense, and everyone willing themselves to believe what suited their mood at the time.
A captain could smile at such talk, within limits. There was always talk on a ship and mostly it was harmless. He kept his orders to himself; and in any case they did not reveal so much as he might expect; but he did not believe that any navy in the world would send so many ships on such a voyage only to make a show. No more than he believed that his generals would admit that they had made a serious miscalculation and abandon the reoccupation of the islands. 
These islands that were only of interest to a few sheep farmers. It was the fault of the politician, Peron. Years ago, everyone had forgotten about the Malvinas before he revived the stupidity. Anything to get the people excited and to present himself as the spirit of the nation. That was the problem with elections; politicians talked all kinds of dangerous rubbish and afterwards they couldn’t wash it off their hands. The generals should have quietly dropped the nonsense as soon as they were rid of him. No-one doubted that the islands were Argentine, and eventually they would be recovered, but the recent strategy had been mistaken. The British would probably have preferred to be free of the islands, if a handover could be achieved without loss of face, but they would never accept this slap in the face of an invasion.
So there would be a war, only for honour, over land that no-one cared about, and yet there is no honour in a war that is fought without good reason. 
At least the British would be far from home, and the plan, so far as the Captain could guess it from his orders, was not a bad one. His ships were to patrol the area to the south: Groups 79.1 and 79.4 would hold position to the north. The British force would have to sail between them to reach the islands, and when they did his fleet would have its chance. Much depended on them coming within range of the air force before they were engaged, and the weather would play its part. 
For now the sea was kind. The men knew their work, and the cruiser made way with a quiet efficiency that was satisfying to her captain. If there was tension on board, it was good that the crew should feel tense, so long as it did not wear them out. It was important to keep up the drills and the discipline this close to the action. If the engagement came, the men must react as if it were no different to their training, thinking of what they were expected to do, not of what might happen to them. 
He felt an impact.
-What was that?
-Torpedo Capitan, port bow
-Damage report, quickly.
Already men were running to react to the situation. If there was a fire, if the magazines caught: well, it would be the end. 
A second impact.
-We lost the engine room Capitan.
-The bow is gone sir.
-Signal Piedra Buena and Bouchard, tell them we are attacked and dead in the water. 
-No power sir, the electrics are down
-Pumps
-Nothing sir
-Are we holed?
-Front bulkheads are holding Capitan, but the main deck is blown out. It’s a big hole, taking in water heavily
-Casualties?
-None in the bow sir, heavy casualties aft. Two of the messes were hit. 
Smoke was coming from all parts of the cruiser. The bridge seemed to be the only area free of it. They could sink or explode at any moment, it was a question of which came first. With no power and a fifteen metre gash in the hull, there was only one order to give, but he requested more detailed reports just to be sure. Not unsinkable after all, he thought.
The life rafts were got off without difficulty. The practised manoeuvre went as smoothly as if it had been a drill. He could still be proud of his boys; everyone did what they needed to do. There was no panic; it was done professionally and with respect for the ship.
He ordered the officer in charge to cease signalling the destroyers. Either they had seen the distress rockets or they had not. The last few life rafts were waiting. When they cast off she was already going down, bow first: no explosions or fires thank goodness. He would have preferred to have seen the finish of her, but at least there was time to say goodbye. Three hundred men and maybe more going down with her.
No more orders to give now. The men in charge of the rafts knew the rules: stay as close together as the weather allows and wait. Maybe the destroyers would get the sub: he hoped so. The knowledge that it must have been watching him for hours, waiting for the right moment to strike, and him knowing nothing about it, was annoying. You had to admire the accuracy of the kill though, one hit on either side of his hull reinforcement. And that is war, he thought, imagine being in that engine room when the torpedo ripped through it. Most of the time, in war as in life, you don’t get to see what hurts you. 

***

A reader of the Examiner that went to press on 2 May 1982 might note that several articles seemed to be variations on a theme of “Job Losses in our Region”. Next to a report on the proceedings on the last meeting of the city planning committee and just before the TV guide and classified advertisements there was a small piece compiled from the news agency handouts headed “South Atlantic Peace Hopes Still Alive”.  The morning nationals went to press later; their banner headlines announcing what the country already knew from its TV and radio; that the cruiser Belgrano had been sunk by an English submarine with the loss of around one thousand Argentine sailors.
After the Belgrano went down, even Matthew understood at last that this was a real war. No possibility of a last minute negotiation because the last minute had passed. 
He was put in mind of a small tin globe that had been on the window sill of his room throughout childhood, showing the places in the world that were part of the British Empire, or Commonwealth, whatever it was supposed to be by then, coloured in bright red. The illusion that there were parts of the world coloured red, was the idea that this war would be fought to defend. It was a pretence like the child’s toy, made of cheap tin that would crumple under a heavy blow.
Matthew did not know much about Argentina, except that it was ruled by a military dictatorship. He never doubted that its armed forces would be no match for Britain’s professional soldiers, even operating at such a distance; and he didn’t notice the imperialist bias implicit in that casual assumption of superiority. Probably the Argentine forces were conscripts; teenagers with no real training, as the tabloids claimed. It was a case of one playground bully picking on a smaller bully. 
As for the Belgrano incident; Matthew believed it a war crime, pure and simple. The ship was outside the exclusion zone unilaterally set by Britain; sailing away from it even. The early reports said that the ship went down in minutes, and that most of the twelve hundred on board were lost. Probably the young crew had no idea what to do and panic broke out. For Matthew, the cruiser had been sunk, not to guard against the damage it might cause, but to defend against the possibility that there might not be a war; that the Americans would force Britain to negotiate and that instead of a military success that would allow the failing government to drape itself in victory, there would be an embarrassing climb down. Suez all over again. 
All this Matthew knew, or thought he knew. But worse than knowing, was the realisation that most people felt happy about events. In a war, they said, you support your own side, and of course there are casualties. Would you rather it was our boys who went down with the ship? The important thing for them was not that people were dying over some insignificant speck on the far globe, but that Great Britain was standing up to aggression. 
For both sides, the situation was very clear. They only disagreed as to what situation it was, which made dialogue impossible. After this event, whatever happened next only provided the raw material that fuelled the preconceptions of each side of public opinion. 
And worse still for Matthew was that he knew without a word being said that there was no way to express his views in the Examiner. His war would be about local interest: homecomings romantic, tragic or glorious, the sad obituaries for boys and men of the region. The question why always carefully brushed out of the picture.
At work, he tried to engage Richard and Ralph to talk about the war. They were supposed to be journalists after all. Ralph would only say that the war showed that history was not quite over and that this was a good thing, as the present state of humanity was so pitiful that change could only promise improvement. When Matthew complained that he was being flippant about wasted life, Ralph said that he had lived through a great war, and found that people were never happier than when they were being called upon to lay down their lives for some allegedly noble purpose. Richard only muttered something cryptic about bread and circuses and claimed that he had nothing more to add.
It turned out that Argentines were equally as capable as British of bravery, resourcefulness and stubbornness, and the war was short but bloody on both sides. The right wing national press blamed British casualties on the French, who had sold sophisticated weapons to Argentina in peacetime, in competition with British suppliers. 
When it was all over, the nation was enjoined to rejoice and celebrate a famous victory. Matthew wrote a short opinion piece for the Examiner, analysing what had been achieved and concluding that at a heavy price the nation had retained another imperial millstone round its neck, an unpopular government had achieved an unassailable lead in the opinion polls, but at least the military dictatorship of Argentina had collapsed. He even submitted the article for publication. Naturally it was rejected without comment.
At least he could look forward to seeing Tim, who was supposed to have been injured in action, but not badly. No-one knew much about it except that he wasn’t maimed or disfigured. It was after the victory parade when he finally came home. Matthew and he had exchanged telephone calls and a few short letters, but only about what they were both doing and when they might meet: nothing personal. Matthew was looking forward to hearing the full story, though he was half prepared to find that Tim would be traumatised by experience and unable to speak about it at this time. 
Still the questions came out almost straight away after their greetings.
-So, what was it like?
-Oh, you know.
Tim only seemed a little bored by the question. He was more interested to hear what everyone else had been doing. 
They were meeting in a small city pub, a cheerful vulgar place that had been repainted in its original Victorian colours. There were three small rooms set on different levels packed with after-work drinkers and no-work drinkers as well as the pre-theatre crowd. The hum of conversation and the businesslike rhythms of beer consumption gave them a comforting anonymity.
But Tim was something of a disappointment to Matthew. He didn’t seem scarred or even different. It seemed that he had no need of the father confessor that Matthew had steeled himself to be.
-You were under fire, right? Matthew asked eventually.
-I see I´m going to have to give you a story, or there’ll be no peace. There´s about three minutes worth of telling. And don’t believe those tales about squaddies cutting ears off bodies or any of that other crap that gets said. There is always someone ready to talk shit and someone else willing to believe it. I didn’t see any men turned into monsters. All I saw the same bloody confusion you get everywhere in life, just more so. That talk about atrocities pisses me off. It´s a joke isn’t it? As if a war’s not atrocity enough.
-I never imagined you’d be bringing body parts home as souvenirs?
-And it pisses me off even more that since I came back everyone’s been tip-toeing around me, talking in concerned voices, as if I’m not  really here or I must be in shock. I’m getting to feel like I should apologize for not being completely fucked up in myself. I’m so sorry to disappoint you all. I mean, things were fucked up, of course, what do you expect? But why does everyone need me to be some kind of basket case? 
-Only tell me about what did happen.
Tim took a long drink. For another moment he seemed angry, and then it passed.
-Nothing much to tell. You know we had that bit of a cruise to get there. It was cold and there were too many of us for one ship. My god, they could have picked a better place for a war. Then we arrived and the staff decided to land us on an island somewhere; to do some fighting I suppose. So we were packed into these little troop carriers, that are guaranteed to make you proper seasick, and off we went. That was horrible, with the waves and the rolling about; just uncomfortable you know.
-When we arrived, they decided there was nowhere to land all of us. The bay was too small. So they said the ones at the back, like me and my mates, would have to go back to the ship and try again next day. Terribly sorry chaps hope it’s not inconvenient for you. You can imagine our comments. 
-And you went back to the same place next day?
-Yes but, since we’d been so polite as to announce our intentions the day before, the Argies decided it would be rude not to have a reception ready for us. Their planes came to shoot us out of the water, and our planes weren’t there. Seems it wasn’t our day to have air cover, unfortunately. We never got out of the boats. Some were blown to pieces. I had a few scratches and came away a bit deaf, so the doctor sent me off to the hospital. You know for maybe five seconds I thought about saying no, I need to stay here with my mates. That kind of insanity is catching. So now here I am. Never fired a gun in anger and can’t say I´m sorry. Paid my debt to queen and country and my life is my own again. I don´t know, I may even be due a pension at some stage, though I expect it will be a useless medal instead.
-I can see that you’re waiting for something more, but really that’s all there is to say. Okay we did see people, our mates, with bits blown off, or pumping blood out of them. Some of them didn’t come home and that’s not very nice, but you don’t need me to tell you that. Other than that, we just did what we were told. There and back again: that´s your war Tim. Hard to see the point of it really. 
Tim paused to watch as a young girl dressed in tight jeans and a baggy sweater walked past in the direction of the bar. He must have been less than fascinated though, because he continued.
-What else did I learn? That it´s like I told you before I went: indecision kills and one person has to give the orders and others follow them. We shouldn´t have been stuck where we were. It was one of those army versus navy things. But shit happens: everyone was trying to do their best. Oh and people bleed more easily than you would think, and everyone secretly thinks they are going to live forever until they don´t.
It wasn’t much. Still more disappointing for Matthew, was that Tim did not express any seething resentment or sense of betrayal. He listened to Matthew’s comments about the Belgrano sinking, that it was just murder and everyone knew it: how the war could have been avoided but for that deliberate act. Tim only shrugged.
-Murder. I suppose so, but that’s a funny word to use about a war? People killing each other is the deal. War’s just murder with fancy dress. What did you expect to happen?
Matthew felt challenged. He started to feel the old anger welling up as he spoke. No hostilities had started. The ship was sailing away from the declared exclusion zone. Tim’s voice when he replied was calm and weary, as if he’d aged for a moment.
-The direction of sailing doesn’t mean anything, he said. That’s how you patrol, forward and back, like sentry duty. And no hostilities? I don’t know what you mean by that. All those guns and boats and planes and it’s not a war? It was a submarine sunk that ship yeah? And if the captain had known there was one of our subs under him, do you think he would have invited the commander aboard for tea?
Matthew felt that the ground shifting under him and that as usual he wasn’t explaining himself well. The central issue, he insisted, was that the conflict was pointless and unnecessary and entered into only to save the reputation of a government.
-Maybe you’re right Matt and the world is run by evil men obsessed with their own greed and egos. I can’t be bothered worrying about it. What I saw, I told you; more like a series of cock ups going on all over the shop; just like everyday life. Nothing where it´s wanted: too much of this, not enough of that: parts that don’t work: plans that don’t work. I just wonder, you know, maybe no one is ever in charge; even if some people think they are. 
-Before I went away I might have agreed you couldn’t have a war without someone deciding that there should be one, and what it was for: but now, well if you told me that my war was just the result of a series of accidents, I’d have to ask you if you thought there was any other kind. 
Matthew decided to drop it. No use to argue with Tim. He’d been there and lived through some horrible times. He was entitled to any consolation he could find right now. In time he would probably see things differently.
-So what now, he asked. Do you have any plans?
-Plans. Well I’ve been discharged by the doctor and I can tell you that I’ve also made a full recovery from any lingering work ethic I might have been suffering. Let’s be honest, I never had that too badly to start with. Not like my dad; living for work until he wasn’t needed any more and got thrown out. I’ll not be looking for a job while the money lasts. I think the first thing for me, and I hope you, is to get very drunk, starting now.
-Agreed, but after that, what?
-That will be then, this is now. 
On this score at least, Tim was as good as his word. Although he claimed not to have been affected by his experiences, it was soon clear to Matthew and everyone else that Tim was not the same. His behaviour was even more outrageous than when he had been at college, but there was a new hardness to him. Before, he’d always been part of the company. He would be the one pushing things towards the edge, but they were all in it together and nobody went too far. At least then he’d seemed to have some idea where the edge was.
Something he’d seen had showed him that really there were no limits. Now every night had to be a carnival. Friends with jobs and ordinary lives could not keep up, but new acquaintances seemed to spring up around him. 
The old friends were willing to indulge him at first. Of course he would have demons to exorcise, even if they were not to be spoken of. They waited for the Tim they knew to come back, but meanwhile there was something scary about his intense and joyless hedonism. 
His drinking had changed. Before he used to drink when he was in a good mood. Now he drank to feel less mean, though the result was not always what he intended.
Tim had never been without something unexpected, biting, and usually funny to say to the smallest audience. Now he was just as rude but morose with it; not even trying to be funny. And these days he could be threatening, though he looked smaller and skinnier than ever. There was a suggestion of violence about him sometimes. Other nights he would down three or four drinks quickly, showing no sense of enjoyment, and then an internal switch would click, the engine would start to run again and he’d be fine, except no-one knew for how long. Anyway you could see that the engine no longer had brakes that worked. 
One night as Matthew was walking him back to his flat, Tim was taken by the idea that someone ought to put some bricks through the windows of the Houses of Parliament. Matthew left him mumbling at the front door when Tim finally managed to fit his key in the lock, but something made him retrace his steps. He found his friend still in the street, loading builder´s rubble into a car that he was in no condition to drive. 
More than once, Tim disappeared from the general company halfway through a boozy night and Matthew found him lying in a nearby street, apparently asleep.
Tim had always been able to handle drink. Small as he was, at the end of the night, he’d been the one whose speech was clear, up for any stupid prank, and sober enough to carry it off. He could be a nasty and malicious drunk, but he could be the same when he was sober. Friends forgave him because he made them laugh; but it was not so amusing when you couldn’t make out what he was saying, or when he started to repeat himself endlessly, or sit in silence for an hour. 
It got so you had to watch him all the time. He might suddenly turn uncontrollable or incapable, or he could just wander off leaving you to worry whether he would ever find his way home. 
It was just no fun to know him, and you never knew when he’d started drinking in a day or even at what point the trouble would start. In the beginning, fifteen or sixteen drinks might do it to him, but later it might be six or seven. Some nights he could still drink all night and seem fine. When it came to the point that two or three drinks would start things spinning, it was obvious that the problem was not going to solve itself, but so far as Tim was concerned there was no problem.
Nothing much was said. In the end they all just accepted that the old Tim was gone. He was a danger, mostly to himself; a liability no one wanted to take on. 
It was still not quite a year since Tim’s return when Matthew went to see him at a rented flat he’d not long moved into. It was close to the town centre, on the eleventh floor of a building that seemed to shift unsteadily in the strong wind. The hallways were dirty and echoing but at least the lift was working. Tim did not encourage him to come in but Matthew more or less insisted. He was shocked to find that the place was more squalid even than their old student house in the worst times. Tim hadn´t lived there long enough for simple neglect to do this. It was as if he had soaked up the decay that pervaded the whole building and determined to concentrate it in his own space.
Tim saw him looking around at the unwashed plates and bowls, the piles of dirty clothes and used bedding spread about randomly; the second hand furniture with the sofa that was missing a leg. 
-It’s just temporary, Tim said.
-You need to get out of here. Have you thought about looking for a job yet?
-Three million people unemployed, didn’t you hear? Tim replied.
-But you have a degree. The army makes you more employable. You’ve got lots of advantages.
-I don’t want a job just yet, okay? I waste too much time at the jobcentre as it is. Most of the people down there, when you talk to them, they’re desperate for work; so let them have it. Selfish of me to take it from them isn´t it? I don’t need much to get by. 
-Your family would help if you let them.
-Talking about my dad? Poor old bastard is worse off than me. No job and he’s trying to keep up appearances. Quite frankly I don’t give a shit about appearances. You can probably see that. Just a good thing they have the mortgage paid off. 
-Tim, no one wants to push you. But you can’t carry on like this. If it was something to do with the army ...you could get help you know.
-It has nothing to do with the army. I wish people would shut up about that.
-But what do you do all day?
Ah, that´s the real question. What do you do? That’s what really worries the normal people; they feel threatened if someone isn´t hard at work like them. Most people need it you know, so they have a reason to get up in the morning, and somewhere to be at whatever time the clock is telling them. Well I don’t need that; never did. You know why they want to be chained to the clock don’t you? Because it keeps them numb; stops them having to worry about feeling anything, or wondering who they are, or where their life is going. Fuck them. 
-So what do you do? Matthew did not want to be drawn into a conversation like this with Tim.
-You need to know? My week starts on Tuesday, when I go down the office to sign on. Can you confirm that you are not undertaking any employment? Yes I can confirm that. Are you making efforts to find employment? Yes, my waking hours are exclusively dedicated to that end. Is there any particular kind of employment that would be appropriate for you? Yes, I have always had a yearning to be a philosopher king and govern my subjects with enlightened despotism. When the time comes they will love me for it. So then I get my little green slip of paper, which is called a Giro, and I take it to the post office and it turns into money. Once I have the money I can get a drink, and then the week really begins. 
-How long is it going to last?
-They give you a brand new Giro every week.
-You know what I mean. 
-Well, you know the Latin – ars longa vita brevis? It means you can be arseholed for a long time in a short life. 
Matthew made one more try
-Tim, people who care about you can’t stand to see you like this.
-They don’t have to, do they? Did I ask them to? They can all piss off. You too Matt. I never liked any of you anyway.

***

Patricia’s inquiry finally ran its course at about the same time as the war ended. It seemed to her that it had been a waste of time, a drudgery that left a bitter taste.
Nothing of any significance had come to light about Mr Obuswu’s death, even though the report seemed to have made everyone happy. The authors were praised for their clarity, and patient, methodical investigation, as well as their dedication. Local politicians queued up to add their endorsement. Everyone who commented was sure that relations between the different communities would move forward on a basis of improved trust as a result of the work that had been done.
Patricia had to admit that what Gerald told her was right: you couldn´t keep forever looking and looking just on the basis that something didn’t feel quite right. The last word is rarely spoken about anything in law or in life, he said, and perhaps just holding the inquiry had been more important than anything it was likely to discover. It was a good lesson for her was that you had to deal with events on the basis of the information that you could reasonably obtain, and then move on. That sounded like good advice but Patricia found it hard to take. She was sure that there was another story that remained hidden. In her mind, she had failed.
She felt she had to visit the Law Centre to explain herself to Alice.
Patricia had long ago given up the volunteer sessions at the local law centre, as her own practice had become busier. She still tried to keep up her contacts with the people, especially with Alice and her husband Des, who did most of the organizing between them. She didn’t visit as often as she would like. The words that Alice spoke to her when they first met were still embarrassingly clear in her memory.
-You young people that come down here to help: you aren’t here forever, dear. You all have you own life to live and that´s as it should be. We are grateful for the time you can give. But remember, me and Desmond have got to live round here for always, even after you don’t come no more. That makes us see some things a little bit different to you. In any case you always be welcome here when you see us.
Back then, Patricia had been certain that Alice had it wrong and she would be the one who always stayed involved with the good work.
The law centre wasn’t pretty. It was housed in one of those public buildings that local authorities make a show of dedicating to community purposes when they run out of other uses for them. The furniture there was had all the comfort rubbed off it by hard use. It was the kind of office where offering a visitor a cup of tea meant finding the least stained and chipped mug. At least it was an office and it was still open.
Alice was a welcoming spirit. She did most of the talking for herself and Des. They hadn’t seen the report, but when Patricia told them that it included no revelations, they did not seem surprised. 
-Don’t talk about it as if you’ve got something to be ashamed of Pat. You did your best, and at least that old story got looked into. You didn’t imagine someone was just going to turn up at your door and tell what really happened, did you? You know, there’s some people, like my Desmond, who thinks that it might be better not to know. Stirring up trouble after all these years for no reason, he would say. 
-What do you think Alice?
-For myself, I think that the truth is always the truth and a lie is always a lie. That’s just how I was brought up. A lie that’s hidden can sit in the dark like something bad and wormy eating away the good fruit.  Probably Desmond is right, but I have to see things my own way. Blame it on being raised with religion. For me, the dead deserve justice as much as the living. I don’t see how you can have it for the one and not the other.
Patricia thought for a moment about her own religion. Desmond made a rare comment.
-What’s true, he said, is that there is not much justice in this world for the living or the dead and you better get used to it. You are never going to know for sure what happened to that poor man and neither is anyone else. One or two who might have some idea won’t say nothing. Raking over old times does no good, and might just do some bad. Some things people just need to forget.
But even if Patricia wasn´t sure that she agreed, what could she do? The inquiry was finished. They had read everything and seen everyone who had anything to say. Well, she thought, everyone except one. 
-Something still annoys me Des. I interviewed the sergeant who was on duty that night. He’s retired now, but he still had that suspicion of me like all of them. It makes it so hard to know if they are telling you all they know. He says that the only person to go into the cell apart from himself and the doctor was a detective who was there just for a few minutes to talk about some other investigation. It seems they would have liked Obuswu to confess to some minor offences that were outstanding on this detective’s files. If I knew for sure there was no one else in the cell that night, it would mean that either the injuries happened earlier, or the officers in the van were responsible in some way. 
-And what does the detective say?
-He’s the only one we haven’t interviewed. He wouldn’t talk to us. His name is Derek Moss. He was sacked not long after the incident for petty theft; dismissed without a pension. He doesn’t want anything to do with the police. 
Desmond nodded.
-That Derek Moss was a bad man alright. I remember him. He was a racist too. Everyone knew: they should have told you that. Was always causing problems for black kids, for no reason. You ask some of the people round here about him, they will remember for sure.
There was no time to chase after Moss, but before the boxes of documents were returned, Patricia was able to look up the few papers that mentioned him once more, including the cases he had been dealing with at the time and the story of his own disciplinary problems, so far as they were recorded. She copied them down in her private notebook, though she couldn’t say why she did it. His offences seemed to be minor and rather pointless and he had never been prosecuted for them. He’d never been part of the Obuswu investigation and certainly was never considered a suspect. 
That trail, if there had ever been one, was as cold as all the others: it was over. She put the notebook in a drawer and tried to forget about it.
David told her, you can’t win every battle. Move on from your failures and think about what you are doing in the present; what you can still get right, or you’ll only sit brooding about the past and be no use to anyone. That was one of the ways they were so different. As soon as David had reached a conclusion like that he´d be able to act on it. He wouldn´t be tormented for years to come about things that could no longer be changed.

Chapter Four

Matthew almost missed the afternoon train back from London. By the time he boarded, the carriages were crowded and most of the seats were taken. He eventually found a place where he could just about wedge his bag into the luggage space above and his person into the gap below, between three burly individuals who more or less filled four seats grouped round a table. He’d barely settled himself and opened his book before the train began to pull out of King’s Cross.
From behind his book, he glanced quickly at his new companions, who seemed to be travelling together. They looked like men who were working in the capital and coming home for the weekend. One of them met his glance and gave him a short nod of acknowledgement. Matthew nodded in reply, but he preferred to be left alone when travelling. He looked back to his book and busied himself finding the right page. In any case he had a lot to think about, mostly about the job. 
He’d only applied for it at Richard’s suggestion. Matthew felt that he’d barely started to understand how the local paper functioned, and it had seemed presumptuous to put himself forward for a position at one of the nationals. He had been certain there would be many other candidates, well connected probably, who would be better at presenting themselves, with better experience, real or invented, than he could offer. Matthew wasn´t prepared to embellish what he had done, and it sounded trivial indeed to him as he related it.
But they had made him the offer on the spot, more or less. The personnel man had said that he should expect to hear from them in the next few days; but that the wait was a formality and he should expect good news.  Matthew was so shocked that he did not know what to say. They’d shown him around the place everyone had seemed so kind and interested.
He turned the pages of the book without absorbing much of the text. His head was still spinning. The three men had been talking more or less continuously all the while, and gradually their conversation began to percolate through into his consciousness. 
The men were builders, working on a site in the west of London. They had contracted to work in the capital because of the slow situation at home, but it seemed that even though there was plenty of work to be done in London, their presence was not welcomed by local construction workers. They were comparing experiences in between complaining about their “digs”.
Before long, these topics of discussion were exhausted and the talk moved on to the news of the day. In spite of himself, Matthew was drawn to listen to their views. Protected by the book that he looked at blankly from time to time, he became their audience. It was as grimly fascinating as watching a current affairs programme on television; the same window on what others were thinking, the same urge to interrupt and explain where the speakers had got it wrong. 
Even the smallest group will throw up a leader and in this case his name was Bill. He was the one who had caught Matthew’s glance earlier; late thirties, big and balding; with powerful arms bulging out of an undersized short sleeved T-shirt that defied the unseasonably cold weather. 
The older man sitting next to Bill was Jack; grey haired and not so confident looking. You could imagine that life had dealt Jack a few hard blows. It seemed that he had lived for some time in the London area previously. 
The third; sitting next to Matthew, was an innocent looking youth whose name he did not catch. This one was the same size as Bill, but pinker and fleshier, with a ready laugh for the comments of the other two. Matthew could not see so much of him without making his interest in the group obvious. 
They had started to talk about the unions, unsurprisingly since that was the big topic of the day, so far as the media were concerned. Matthew noted that Bill had a crumpled and folded copy of that morning’s “Sun” on the table before him. 
-Well obviously you can’t believe all the shit you read in this, said Bill, tapping the paper, but the fact is, the unions has got beyond a joke. Something’s got to be done about it.
-It might be good if we had a union though, the young man replied. If it meant we got the same rates of pay as the London lads.
-It wouldn’t work that way, Bill responded. They’d want their own union to save the work for themselves and keep the likes of us out. No lad, the sad truth is that, trades unions, it’s not the British way. It’s like they say in the paper. Unions is alien to the British culture.
-They keep telling us that, the old man noted. Must be they want us to believe it. 
-There’s going to be a right old struggle, Bill nodded. 
The prospect seemed to fill him with satisfaction.
-Anyone can see it coming. All what’s happened up to now has just been the skirmishing, but the miners will be next, and then it’s full on war. She hasn’t forgot that they brought down the Tories last time. 
-Who’s she Bill?
-Maggie Thatcher lad. Don’t you read nothing? She’ll have her revenge on them, whatever it takes. 
-But why are the unions so bad Bill, that’s what I don’t understand. I keep hearing about this union they’ve started in Poland, in the shipyards. You know, what is it called?
-It’s called Solidarity, said Jack helpfully. Only it´s in Polish; but that´s what it means.
-That’s the one. Well, when I hear about that union, they seem to be telling us that it’s a good thing and we have to support all the brave workers, standing up to the state.
Bill sighed.
-That’s Poland lad. Their situation is completely different. We’re British. They have an oppressive communist government. Solidarity is a political union, but our unions are just looking to grab more money for their members. 
-Maybe our unions should be more political then, Jack suggested. Bill ignored the comment
-But; the young man continued, the papers say that our unions are trying to bring down the government, just like they say about Solidarity. It seems that when they say that in Poland it’s a good thing, but here it’s a bad thing. 
Bill did not see the problem with this. 
-What you need to understand, he said, is that our country is more advanced than them. This is where the industrial revolution started, isn’t it? Back in the old days, there was a place for the unions. It was a struggle for the rights of the working man back then, all well and good, but that was in the past. You’re taking home a pretty good screw this week I expect?
-I’m not doing too bad, the boy conceded. 
-So there you are, and the miners are well paid as well. Nowadays anyone who’s not frightened of work can earn good money. But these modern unions we have now, they’re just greedy. A lot of the members don’t want to work and the officials are just in it for themselves, crazy for power or in it for themselves. Look at that Arthur Scargill: he’s mad, you can tell just to look at him. Something’s got to be done, because they are ruining the nation’s productivity.
By now Matthew could see that the young man was taking a great interest in the conversation. Being stuck on a train for a couple of hours was probably a rare opportunity for him to reflect on life. He had another question for his more experienced workmate.
-But what exactly is productivity Bill? Everyone talks about it like it’s the most important thing in the world, only I’m, not really sure what they are on about. 
-It’s … well it’s productivity isn’t it? Bloody obvious. It’s about turning up to work and grafting, not just expecting to collect a wage for being there. It’s like what we do. Proper working.
-It’s a measure of the work done per employee, if you average out all the work that everyone does, said Jack. 
The young man grunted, but did not seem much enlightened. 
-And it’s bloody important, added Bill, because if we don’t improve productivity, the bloody Germans will beat us. They are beating us already. That’s why we have to put the unions in their place. They are wrecking our productivity with their strikes. 
Jack leaned forward and spoke quietly.
-My brother in law used to say that a lot of what we hear about days lost to strikes is rubbish. He said that when his company had produced more cars than they knew what to do with, management would get the men out on strike. It was easy enough to do, he said. They just had to pick on someone or mess about with the shift patterns. Within a week there’d be a dispute and then the union would have to back its members. Then you had a stoppage and no need to pay the men who are on strike. It was a good way of saving money, he said. 
-Your brother in law was a shop steward I suppose, said Bill. 
-No, he worked in personnel at Dagenham. For the mighty Ford Corporation, as he liked to say. Bit of a shit, he was, to be honest.
Bill snorted dismissively.
-That’s all very well, but once we get rid of strikes and tame the unions, Britain will start to be a world leader of industry again, like when we were boys. Exporting to every country: finest products in the world. Best steel, best ships, best engines. You’ll see it happen. Productivity is the key. 
-But Bill, if there’s more productivity around, how does it help me, the young man asked. 
-Well if productivity goes up, the company you work for makes more money, and so you benefit, Bill explained.
It seemed that the boy’s questions were beginning to exasperate him. 
-How?
-Well you’ll have a bloody job for a start.
-But if everyone is working harder, won’t they need less people to do the work?
-It’s not like that at all. You and me have to work hard because we’re down the road if we don’t. But if you’re in a union, you can just show up and they have to pay you whether you graft or just sit on your arse all day. 
-Mining isn’t an easy job, Jack observed. 
-Granted, said Bill. It’s not easy, but it’s nowhere near as hard as it once was. 
-I’m still confused, the young man admitted.
Bill sighed, but he was not ready to give up and leave his young friend in a state of ignorance. 
-Give me strength, he said. Where’s the tea service on this train? Look; say you are in a union, and they decide you should go on strike: you have to do it. It’s the rules. And then, no money for you when you’re not working. 
-I couldn’t do that. Me and Julie just bought our house from the council, and there’s a kid on the way. I got a mortgage
-And you got the house cheap didn’t you, thanks to Maggie? Bill’s smile was encouraging.
-Which is fine, except they aren’t building any new homes to rent to the young ones that come after him, Jack observed. That’s how come we have to come two hundred miles down the line at the start of every week to find work.
-There won’t be no more need for council housing in the future, Bill told him. Everyone will be able to buy their own house, once the building trade gets back on its feet. 
-No, I wouldn’t be able to go on strike, the young man repeated. Couldn’t afford it. 
His point finally won, Bill turned triumphantly to Jack. 
-And you know what’s coming, he said. Like it or not. It’s might be all talk at the moment. Whether the law should say this, that or the other. That’s all a load of crap. You know it will be the government against the miners, and all out scrap. She won’t back down, not her. Not if it means closing every pit in England, and leaving all the coal under the ground forever. We’re in for a right old battle. 
He was smiling. Matthew looked again at the battered copy of the “Sun” that lay flat under his huge palm. 
Two days later the man from London phoned to tell Matthew that the job was his. Matthew thanked him, but said that after thinking it over, he’d decided to stay with the Examiner for the time being. He said the time wasn’t right for him and they talked briefly about if he should change his mind later, but Matthew was sure that they both understood that he was turning down a chance that wouldn´t be offered twice. 

***

So in March 1984 Matthew James was still working as a junior reporter for the Examiner. On bad days, he already he felt like he’d squandered his one shot at life. He´d had the opportunity to make his way in the wide world, and the more he thought about it, the more it seemed to him that cowardice rather than principle had made him stay curled up in his little provincial life. But then, if Matthew had run away from the national news, it seemed that the news was about to seek him out.
The miner’s strike had started, as everyone had known it would. There were almost two hundred thousand men employed in the pits and most of them had downed tools. When it had happened before, the country had ground to a halt, and the government had fallen. But this time would be different. The miners themselves knew that they had walked into a trap, and that the government was determined to break their power for good. It was no time for striking: spring, with warm weather on the way, and the coal stocks high. Power stations would continue to supply electricity for months, so long as the coal that was already above ground could be delivered to them. 
The union leaders had been left with no choice. The bosses had announced that twenty pits must close and twenty thousand jobs would go. It was a declaration of war and there was no line of honourable retreat. The union would have to rely on solidarity and help from other workers to prevent the movement of coal. But already all the unions had been battered by legal attacks, and the resolve of its own members in some regions had been softened by offers of local concessions.
The country anticipated an epic struggle, of historic significance, and as such it was a story that the Examiner would normally ignore. Its circulation base was geographic, rather than political, and on such a polarized issue it was certain that any comment reflecting the views of one section of its readership would be hugely offensive to another. All the same, it wasn’t easy for the paper to pretend that nothing reportable was occurring, because many of the coal mines and storage depots were located in its heartland, and it was clear that these sites would be the battlefields of the dispute, in a literal sense. 
Still, most of the paper´s readership lived in a city which had no working pits of its own left, even if it was in the heart of a mining region. In the streets, nothing was different apart from the bills posted on walls by fringe socialist groups and the men and women standing on corners and outside pubs with buckets, collecting for the families and asking for support. They would rattle the bucket and a supporter would drop some money in and the man or woman would grin, and maybe wish on Margaret Thatcher the same slow and painful death she was trying to inflict on the coalfields, and the citizen would smile and agree, and go about his business.
But for Matthew the sense of history taking place on his doorstep was accompanied by an uncomfortable feeling of obligation to be part of it in some way. He couldn’t believe it when word came through of the confrontation that was looming in the south of the county, and Richard told him that there were no plans for them to cover the story.
Police lines will be that thick, you wouldn’t get within a mile of the place, press pass or no, he said.
-Ralph turned and winked at Matthew.
-Not that he’s scared to go of course.
-I’m scared, do I look daft? It will be carnage.
-Would you go, Ralph? asked Matthew.
-Young Matthew, you have a lot to learn. Any journalist worthy of the name would put the pursuit of the truth, wherever it may lie, above considerations of personal safety. On the other hand, there seems to be a reasonable chance of getting your head kicked in, as they like to say around these parts, and it would be pointless. 
-Pointless? What does he mean Richard?
-He means lad, that you could risk life and limb and bring us a great story back and no one would print it. It’s a subject that is a little bit controversial for us.
Ralph nodded.
-And I might add Richard, that some of the facts as young Matt would see them, might not accord with the settled opinions of our employers.
Matthew tended to defer to his experienced colleagues, but now he was outraged.
-Controversy is what a newspaper is for. Our readers must be sick of hearing about garden fetes and round table meetings. I’m not talking about a political essay. I just think we should give them the facts; what they could see with their own eyes if they were there.
Ralph smiled.
-Ah, Richard. Simple facts, simple truths. It makes me long to be young again. If only facts were not impotent in the face of what people prefer to believe.
-Shut up Ralph. Er, you are right Matt, independence and objectivity. Vital for a good reporter. That’s the proper spirit and we can use it. This week for example, sports reporting, you need some of that in your CV. How about this Saturday. The once mighty Leeds United face Chelsea, at Elland Road, and frankly Eddie’s lads haven’t a chance. There’ll be more action off the field than on it. What do you say?
-A bit nervous about that one too, Richard?
-Shut up Ralph
Matthew had no interest in football, or even in football violence, He decided to cover the miners’ dispute instead, on his own initiative. No one else from the paper was going to do it, not even the staff photographer who was supposed to accompany him. Richard was right though; he couldn’t get near the place. He drove round the area in his battered, ancient car, being turned back at successive checkpoints by policemen who looked more than ready to dispense summary justice if he should choose to object. 
He retraced his route, looking for a way through. All the villages and unfamiliar roads began to merge in his mind. He drove without a plan, only trying to get closer to whatever might be happening. He kept hearing tantalising fragments of sound; shouting, cheering, undecipherable voices issuing from loud hailers: sounds that were unsettling but somehow exciting.
He was crawling down an estate road in low gear. At the back of the estate, the housing gave way to fields. There was a railway line running across land at the top of the road. He thought he may as well abandon the car for the moment and see if it was possible to walk get closer to the scene on foot. 
Outside the car, the area was strangely quiet. The shouting was distant and muffled: it reminded him of visiting his aunt, on match days, in the little terrace house near to the football ground. There was no one about; just a kid playing in an old pedal kart in one of the gardens. It was a street something like the one he grew up in. He imagined net curtains in the front rooms twitching. Were the people frightened to come out, he wondered?
A few moments later, the street was filled with sounds of shouting, and men, began running into the lane from the adjacent open ground. Wild eyed men, yelling incoherently, some with clothing ripped, others bleeding, some stopping to pick up bits of bricks and stones that were lying about; hurling them at their pursuers, who seemed to be policemen. Matthew assumed they must be police, though he thought they seemed like a futuristic version of Viking raiders. They were bearing round perspex shields and long batons, wearing strange helmets, and they seemed full of fury. He saw a group of them fall upon a man who had been picking up stones and left it too late to run. The man went down in a flurry of boots and batons. Matthew didn’t see him get up. 
Matthew himself remained perfectly still, as if frozen. The wave of pursued and pursuers broke over him leaving him untouched. Some of the officers passed close enough for him to see their faces behind the plastic visors. They had the faces of hunters, shining with the excitement of the chase; eyes locked on their prey. 
The main body of strikers fled up the road with the police at their heels, and Matthew lost sight of them. A few of the miners had turned the other way, into a cul de sac, and there they regrouped and stood their ground. Some more police arrived, but it was clear that they were outnumbered by the stragglers. The uniformed men hesitated, and the miners were at them immediately. The scuffle was short and the officers began to run in panic, back across the fields, but one or two of them were left behind.
One of them lay in front of Matthew, stretched on the ground. He looked more winded than injured, as if he’d tripped while running. One of the miners stepped over him; a big man with the left arm of his denim jacket all but ripped off. He had longish hair, lank with sweat, and his eyes were staring out under heavy eyebrows. He picked up a heavy top stone from the garden wall, raised it with one arm as if it had no weight, and dropped it onto the officer’s helmeted head. The prone man groaned and tried to move. The miner picked up the stone, as if he was about to drop it onto the man’s head again. 
-No. Don’t.  
The man looked up angrily at Matthew’s shout. It seemed as if he would attack Matthew instead of the officer, but Matthew couldn’t say any more: his voice seemed to have vanished. Instead he pointed beyond the garden wall, where the kid was still sitting in his pedal car, with his mouth open, not moving or making any sound. The big man’s expression changed. He seemed choked with emotion, that he had no words to express. His body sagged. He shook his head and tossed the stone aside. Matthew found another word.
-Why?
-You wouldn’t ask me if you’d seen what’s going on back there. They won’t let others see it though, only we have to see and feel it. It’s a battle. And these bastards are her storm troopers. They’re killing us. Like Bloody Sunday. Aye, like over in Ireland. Bastards are killing us, and taunting us about getting paid double time for doing it.
He turned and ran after his companions. The police were not many minutes after, in greater numbers. Some of them wanted to arrest Matthew. It was clear that the state they were in, his press pass meant nothing to them. Lucky that he had not tried to run. He’d been too frightened to try. In the end they told him to piss off home before they stopped being nice to him, and not to come back where he wasn’t wanted. He was happy to oblige.
Matthew wrote up the story of his day, only including what he’d seen and heard. The article was rejected. Later he saw photographs of the main action that people braver than him had been able to take. There were seventeen local newspapers in the area and none of them ran the story or used the pictures. Richard said that his piece was well written and did him credit. Ralph said that he hoped Matthew had learned a valuable lesson.
If there was a lesson, it was wrapped in the sense of outrage and disgust that Matthew felt for the next few weeks, even though he couldn’t exactly explain the reason for it. He even fell out with his friends over it, when Patricia started talking about being for the miners, but they were not above the rule of law. Respect for the law was more important than any one issue, she said.
They were meeting in a pub called the Woolpack. It wasn’t exactly a local; more the place they had used to get together in the college days. Patricia said it had a good atmosphere, meaning that you could talk seriously about subjects other than work or football without having to get blind drunk first. David said it was a student bar. They didn’t really fit with the company any more, but they hadn’t quite realized it yet.
The pub was full of little groups sharing earnest conversations about themselves and their ideas, without any apparent sense of irony. It made them feel nostalgic. Probably it was also the reason that they started arguing about ideas between themselves. Matthew said that it was stupid to trust in the rule of law if you were someone that the laws were passed specifically to repress. David could see things getting heated and suggested that they didn’t need to start a debate when they had come out to relax with a quiet drink. Patricia took exception.
-I understand that it’s normal for English people to become too crippled with embarrassment to talk seriously in public, but this is important David.
It was the first time that David had noticed that she sometimes talked like her mother. She went on to say that the papers were right about this at least. Without respect for the law and honest lawyers to make sure the system worked fairly, there wouldn´t even be a right to peaceful protest. The only authority would be brute force. Then Matthew lost his temper.
He said that the law was stuck in eighteenth century constitutional theory that was even more ridiculous in a country with no written constitution.
-You are talking absolute bollocks Pat and you must know. Might is right; it is that simple.  If you don’t believe me, it’s a short drive to South Yorkshire. Go ask the boys in blue what they make of your right to peaceful protest. At least they don’t have any doubt it’s about sides and which one they are on. They don’t imagine that their levels of pay and their pension rights and their double time for bashing strikers have anything to do with catching criminals. 
-You talk about a rule of law as if it came down from god, or has anything to do with justice. Laws defend property and they depend on force. The state has to claim a monopoly on violence to exist; that’s from one of your eighteenth century philosophers. The only difference between us and the Soviets is that in England we’re allowed to pretend that our opinions matter. We can say what we like, so long as we do as we’re told.
David decided to let the storm run its course. They were as bad as each other. It was always the same with Matthew, unfortunately. Too shy to speak when it was a social situation, then someone would make a comment that he disagreed with and he had to rise to it. And because life for him was more about ideas than people, he didn´t know when to stop. Before you knew where you were he’d fallen out with someone and then he’d be mortified about it. Now he was sitting in silence, slightly red in the face, and David could imagine his thoughts; frustrated that he had not expressed himself well, anguished by his missing social grace, embarrassed at making a fool of himself. 
He could be so much happier if he would just try to lighten up, David wanted to tell him. Talk about serious things if you like, but without raging as if the world depended on what you think about them. 
Then David turned to his wife, who was also sitting in silence. Was she offended at Matthew attacking her life´s work? Not really, he decided. She seemed more coolly amused. She had that same expression when she was telling him how she had managed to provoke a hostile witness to an outburst that betrayed their own case in cross examination. 
But the two of them seemed to like each other less and less these days. Why couldn´t his wife and his best friend get on, he wondered? They were both good people in their own ways. Matt needed to grow up. And Patricia? - for a moment he worried that giving so much to her career was turning her into a person who thought that the point of life was to win arguments; but as soon as he realized he was having an ungenerous thought about his wife he refused to allow that notion space in his mind.

Chapter Five

It was a hot country in a dry season.
When times were good, the wealthy elite would drive out of the city at this time of year, heading for their summer residences in the cooler hilly lands to the east. Now times were anything but good. In this year the only road still open led south. It seemed like anyone who could was heading out of town on that road by any means possible, travelling as fast as they could. It was a time of dust, and there was disaster in the air.
But Ray Hawkins was sick of hearing the Europeans complaining about the heat. This is Africa, he wanted to say; if you can’t stand it what did you come here for? So far as Ray was concerned, he’d felt cold enough, in enough different parts of the world, to last for one lifetime. The weather could stay as hot as it liked. 
He was troubled by a different kind of heat. The government of this country was his customer, and the government was falling apart. That was a regular and foreseeable situation: his difficulty right now was that this regime was disintegrating even faster than was usual in this volatile place. Faster than he’d allowed for. He’d needed to stay on to make sure of being paid. Now he needed to get out as quickly as possible before the real trouble started. 
There’d been shelling already on the outskirts of the city. It hadn’t caused much damage, but plenty of panic. In a month or two the rebels would be settled in as the new government and he´d return, discreetly and start to deal with the new bosses. It was the transition times that were most dangerous; the time of conflict and the period of gang rivalry and tribal blood-letting that came after.
He knew that he’d stayed on far too long. For the money involved it wasn’t worth the risk. It was just good luck that Albert was there too and had been able to offer him a ride to the airport. Now there was a man who had resources inside him that you wouldn’t guess at, to look at him; both mental and physical. Albert would always find a way. A little balding guy, Indian looking, with a paunch that made him appear older than he probably was. Comical really: he always wore a suit and tie as if to say that heat could not get to him, nor dust nor the distance to the nearest dry cleaners either. It seemed that he could disarm even these people with a smile. Ray wasn’t even sure that he carried a weapon. 
Albert was waiting for him when Ray paid the bill and walked out of the hotel carrying only a black attaché case. He had left his luggage in the room, not bothering to pack. 
-What do you think of the car? Albert asked.
Ray looked the battered Toyota up and down.
-Did you get a warranty?
Albert shook his head, laughing.
-And I had to pay cash.
-The paper money’s no good anyway: I wouldn’t worry. I think it might take us as far as the airport. It’s as well we’re not planning a return trip.
They got in the vehicle. The passenger side door had clearly belonged to another car, of a different colour and probably of a different type; but Ray managed to shut it after a fashion. When they set off it was clear that the suspension only existed as a memory, but the engine started first time, or at least the cylinders that were still firing did. 
-Nice, said Ray.
-I bought it from my driver Michel. He’s been driving me around in it for a week so I think it should be fine so long as we don’t run out of gas. 
-Shouldn’t Michel be using this heap to get as far away as possible from what is coming down the line?
-I tried to tell him that. He says that he can’t leave the family and his father in law is too ill to travel. 
-The money won’t be much good to him. 
-It might help. I gave him my good watch as well. Told him not to let anyone see it unless he is talking to someone worth bribing.
-That might do more harm than good. 
-Possibly; how can we know what is for the best?
They drove on without speaking for a time, listening to the wounded rattle of the engine. Every few blocks the traffic became heavier, until they were moving at walking pace. The road was jammed with every kind of transport, overloaded with people and possessions. Now and then they passed carts being drawn by animals, or dragged along by straining humans; all of them inching forward only a little slower than the motorized traffic. Horns were sounding everywhere, to no obvious effect.
The drivers leaned on their horns, but there was no sense of rage. The people were past impatience and too exhausted to be angry. A few days earlier there had been an ugly, fearful mood sweeping through the city, making everyone suspicious of each other. Now the violence of that time had given way to a mood of resignation and defeat. At one or two of the bigger junctions, a few uniformed figures were attempting, half-heartedly, to regulate the traffic; blowing whistles and gesticulating with pantomime exaggeration. Their orders were ignored. It seemed that even the officers no longer minded if they were ignored. Some of the military had joined the file of refugees; beaten men walking with shoulders drooping, wearing tunics over jeans, or combat pants topped by T-shirts; weapons and pack gone. 
Now and then a light motorcycle would weave through the traffic, carrying two, or sometimes three passengers. Riders of all ages, some with infants nestling on their laps: the whine of their engines rising above the deeper coughing of the other vehicles as they approached and fading as they passed on up the road. Under the noise of engines and horns, the road was strangely empty of human voices. No one seemed to have anything left to say. 
Hawkins checked his watch again, uselessly as he knew. Occasionally Albert would make up some time by passing the slow moving traffic on the inside; on what passed for a pavement, or by cutting through little used back streets, where they could make reasonable progress, but always had to rejoin the main flow at some point. 
Perhaps they would not make the flight, Hawkins thought. He cursed himself for not leaving days ago. He’d known it would come to this. It wasn’t as if it was his first regime change.
At one point, they passed by some buildings where shells had fallen. It seemed that at least one had exploded directly on top of some of the houses or offices, which were more or less obliterated. Water was flowing from a pipe that protruded from the ruin, and women were collecting it patiently in pails, whilst black skinned kids, with white teeth and pink palms, stared and pointed at the scene of destruction and at the line of cars and trucks moving slowly past them. 
In another place, shop fronts had been smashed and the blackened walls showed that the stores had been burnt out. It was obvious that this damage was not the result of shelling. Some shops had been left alone and others completely emptied out. The tribal rivalries that normally lay under the surface were emerging.
Clear of the city proper now, they started to make slightly better progress. The traffic was moving almost continuously, though at a painfully slow pace. Beyond the road and the ditch that lined it, they started to see the savannah scrub: dusty grass with the colour bleached out. Here and there a man of indeterminable age peacefully watching a cow or two; a scene that repeated itself like the motif of a pattern; the dozing man untroubled by the exodus from the city, since it did not disturb his cow.
Most of the roads in the city were badly broken up; just collections of holes punctuated by mounds of tarmac shovelled indiscriminately from the backs of lorries in a futile attempt at repair. Here on the outskirts, the surface was a little better, outside of the rainy season, but there was still the occasional reminder of the violence that was tearing the country apart. They passed a body, halfway in the drainage ditch, torso bent unnaturally, shirt riding up over a swollen belly. Fortunately the face was pointed away from them, but matted hair and blood from an exit wound made a sticky mess on the road beside the head. Flies had come to claim the corpse, but it seemed that no-one else would. 
Now Hawkins could make out the perimeter fence of the airfield in the distance, and yet their progress remained maddeningly slow. He realized that they were not actually travelling slower than before. It was just that being so near, and feeling the time slipping away from them, was intolerable. He could almost sense the jet engines warming for take-off. I could run it from here, he thought. But then, the airport buildings were a couple of kilometres beyond the gate and once they were through that, there should be no more traffic to delay them.
Outside the car there was only still air, dust and heat. If the taxi had once boasted air conditioning, it was not working now, and the open windows gave them no relief. He was soaked with sweat. The hot air was thick with the promise of a storm. Certainly more than one kind of storm was coming after them. 
Two armed and uniformed guards were stationed at the perimeter gate, whether they were military or private, who could say. It was surprising enough that they had chosen to remain at their posts, either way. The crumpled wreck of the cab aroused their attention, but once they spotted a European inside, they waved the vehicle on thorough the checkpoint.
- We are going to make the flight after all, Hawkins promised himself. 
It was one of those international airports where a man is paid to keep goats off the landing strip. Albert parked the car neatly outside the airport offices, which comprised of various portacabins, and a more permanent structure that served as an arrivals and departures hall. It had even boasted a sliding glass door, which had ceased to slide for want of maintenance. Now it was wedged open giving the flies and everyone else ready access. 
-Decent enough wheels as it turned out. Your boy didn’t rob you.
-Yes, it would be nice to think he’ll be okay.
Inside the hall, another kind of disorder, raised voices at the edge of panic: angry, demanding, frightened voices. Through the crowd they caught sight of Johnson, the man from the embassy. Hawkins pushed his way through the mob towards him. Albert followed. People were jostling one another, stumbling against luggage that was piled everywhere, or staggering under the weight of their own belongings. Families guarded baggage trolleys obtained from who knows where, awaiting husbands who had set off to demand or plead on their behalf. Airline functionaries tried to disengage themselves from the grip of travellers, or would be travellers. People had begun to argue among themselves, and generally violence seemed to be lurking not far under the surface of things. 
Johnson was relatively unobtrusive, in a lightweight suit, with no mark of office. He was talking in the local dialect to a well-dressed and very excited man, who was clearly insisting that something should be done for him. The conversation was hard to make out, but the man was gesturing repeatedly, making signs that indicated clearly enough an offer of cash. He must be trying to buy tickets for this last flight out, maybe if some other unfortunate could be bumped off the flight. Eventually Johnson resorted to English.
-I’m afraid you don’t understand sir; it’s not a question of whether you can pay. There is simply no room on this plane. All the places are taken, and in any case you do not have a passport with a European country of origin. Only Europeans. I have no authority to help anyone else to leave the country. 
It was not clear whether the man understood the words, but for some reason, he accepted that being addressed in English meant that the discussion was at an end. At any rate, the man stopped talking for a moment, and Johnson took the opportunity to turn away from him and greet the newcomers. He nodded to them both and in the same motion took Albert’s arm, propelling him towards the departures desk, ignoring the crowd milling around it. They marched straight past the official controls. Everyone knew Mr Johnson. 
-Poor devil, I wish I could help him, but there’s no end to that if you once start. Glad to see that you chaps made it anyway. No time to chat. Your seats are reserved but that won’t count for much until you’re sitting on them. Still got your British passports? Good: some nasty stories about those in the last few days, although I suppose you boys may have spares. You’re the last of my people so I’ll walk out to the plane with you. Just a stroll across here. What me, no, I’m staying on. Of course the ambassador’s been unavoidably called back to London: call it a tactical withdrawal. Just me and a few other of the expendables left to mind the store. 
Johnson was one of those lean, prematurely balding men who are burned red by the sun without ever tanning. Five years in Africa and this was his third state of emergency. He was an incessant talker, though he always spoke in the clipped style of an official telegram, as if words were precious. It was a pattern of speech that suited him, as if saying that here was a man who never had a moment to spare. He made it his business to know everyone, and had seldom been heard to make an overtly critical comment about anyone. 
Still it was unusual for a career diplomat to show such respect to a pair of notorious arms dealers, especially in times that had become as messy as this. Hawkins found himself wondering whether it was only professionalism that made Johnson so polite, or did the man have his own singular view on the causes of these upheavals that afflicted the region to regularly. Probably he was just an old fashioned Englishman, of a particular class, and the politeness was ingrained. In any case, Hawkins had noticed that at times like these, the Europeans tended to behave, temporarily, as if they were all in the shit together.
As they walked across the tarmac, Johnson explained that he was optimistic that the embassy might be left alone this time around, barring stray artillery fire, which of course could not be ruled out, given the levels of accuracy of the gunners on both sides. For all his talk of punishing the foreigners and taking the land back for the people, the new man would not want to cut off the flow of foreign aid into his treasury before he had even begun to rob it. His present concern would be to gain personal control of as much of the nation’s wealth as he could grab before the soon to be exiled President was able to divert more funds into his various Swiss accounts. Johnson continued, barely pausing for breath.
-The President was an idiot of course. The new man was the hero of the army and saviour of the nation. He even fought in the battle that saw off the last regime, unlike most saviours of the nation, who only get the title through bullying and murder. Then they made him Supreme Head of the Armed Forces, but that was never going to keep him quiet. The President should have sent him abroad or had him quietly shot. And then for the President to leave the country when he did, only to attend another of those idiotic conferences of African leaders that they all love so much; that cost a fortune and never achieve anything. He might as well have left the keys to the national bank behind. But I suppose you boys knew it was coming.
Albert admitted that he’d been approached by the General to supply certain equipment, and that it had been pointed out that the General was a man who did not forget his friends.
-By which he means of course, that he remembers his enemies, and his enemies are all those who are not his friends.
-Quite.
-Well I suppose you must have told him no, for whatever reason, given that you are leaving us now in something of a hurry. Rather strange that. In this country the odds generally favour the rebels rather than the incumbents. I would have expected you to know which way the wind was blowing.
 -But the government pays cash, and maybe I had other reasons. In any case, it’s true that if I’m not on this flight, my life is not worth much more than those unfortunate citizens who happen not to be members of the General’s tribe. 
-Don’t worry, plenty of time for you now
-But you do know there is going to be a bloodbath when the General gets here?
Johnson shrugged.
-What can I do? When it starts, we’ll give them official notice that Her Majesty’s government deplores excessive violence directed against civilian populations. We shan’t use the genocide word of course. They’ve had harsh words from us before, and they know what they’re worth. I’ve engaged as many gardeners, cooks and waiters as I can decently hire, a lot more than we can find work for, and I’ve told them to bring their families into the compound till it’s over. I shall probably be in trouble even for that, but it’s little enough. You know how it is, there’s a line you can’t cross. If you do, you find yourself outside looking in. 
-We crossed the line when we started giving these people aid and telling them to develop their countries, Albert replied. Before that they grew their own food and the worst they had to fear was a dry year. Now their rulers have a treasury to fight over and governments that steal their land for imaginary businesses to impress foreigners.
-Possibly you´re right, Johnson admitted. All beyond my pay grade. But at least, you know, the new man couldn’t really care less about tribal differences. He just rants about it to get his people fired up so he can get his own hands on the loot. Hopefully the blood-letting will wear itself out in a few days. The trouble is that once the ordinary people start killing each other, they seem to get a taste for it, until finally no-one is in control.
-Well, here we are. The plane is a bit antique, but the best we could do at short notice, not too many pilots eager to land here just at the moment. It’ll get you as far as Nairobi at least: I’m confident of it. 
The jet was small, ancient and seemingly overcrowded. There was information for passengers printed in Cyrillic script on the backs of the seats. Johnson had assured the passengers in his charge that all their baggage, however weighty, would be loaded directly they were on board: it was the easiest way to get everyone onto the aircraft: but now it seemed that there were no baggage handlers attending the flight at all. Hawkins thought about the belongings he’d abandoned at the hotel and smiled. 
He considered the battered and ancient state of the aeroplane, reflecting that it was better not to know what maintenance and fuelling programmes had been applied to it. Even so, as the engines strained at take off and they struggled to gain altitude, looking down on the arid landscape, he felt safe for the first time in many days.
He kept watching. From the air the country seemed greener, and as you got further away from the bitter and pointless struggles between the humans below, you felt calmer.
 If you flew around the world at altitude, he thought, not in space, but high enough in the sky so that you didn’t have to see the actual people, then it would look as if most of the world that wasn’t water was busy growing food. You’d be looking down on fields mostly, with just the occasional urban sprawl, and you might never realize how many people were crammed into those urban areas, or with what ferocity they competed with each other and shaped the lives of all the rest.
Albert was in the middle seat. The man sitting next to the aisle was British too. Albert was talking to him and Hawkins listened with half an ear to the conversation. Their neighbour was a red faced engineer with a Scottish sounding name. He’d come to build a dam, that would probably now never be built, even though what sounded like a serious amount of money had already been spent on the project. The engineer was most indignant, for the wasted money and for his dam. He was sure that the revolution was a bad thing, because it was the end of his dam. As to the causes of the unrest, or the violence that might follow it, he knew and cared nothing. 
Albert asked the engineer, quite gently, what good the dam would have done for the people, most of who lived on small farms that weren’t supplied with water. His companion did not follow the argument, it was evident that the dam was a good thing, or else the engineer would not have been sent to build it. 
Hawkins could see that Albert was amused by the conversation. Later, as the engineer occupied himself with trying to secure a decent gin and tonic, the little guy gave him a big smile and whispered.
Ray, that is so British. They need a dam because he has to build a dam. It’s that unselfish egoism. Whatever you happen to be doing is the most important thing and it’s always for the general good. 
Hawkins nodded. He was grateful to Albert and he liked the man, even if you couldn’t always make out what he was talking about.

Chapter Six

As time went by, Matthew found that he was no longer certain that he cared for journalism. Unfortunately, he could think of nothing else that he cared for more. It seemed that the fixed points in his life were the job and his friendship with David and Patricia.
He’d married Carol eventually, but for both of them the marriage had not seemed to take. They drifted into and out of it over the course of a few years, without the process seeming to make much impression on either of them. Matthew only registered the death of some illusions that for him had never really come to life in the first place. 
Looking back, the word that seemed to apply most to his marriage was lacklustre. In fact, he thought, he could apply that description to his life in general. 
Without enthusiasms, he seemed only to be waiting for life to begin. After the divorce, his consolation was the discovery that there was a type of woman who was drawn to his prematurely world weary pessimism. His face was getting older, starting to match his temperament, and it surprised him that a succession of these women found their way into his bed. The languid pursuit of them gave him comfort and a hiding place from the unspecified sense of disappointment that haunted his days. 
He knew that David did not approve of this way of life: Patricia also he supposed. Neither of them said anything to him about it except to make the occasional joke at his expense. And now, he reflected, I´m the dissolute friend as well as the failure.
Work was another comfort, as well as an entertainment. Richard and Ralph had strong opinions about the most surprising things and it seemed that they could not stop themselves delivering their views to the world in general. Most days one or other of them would find something to set him off, though neither considered himself opinionated. On slow days, Matthew would dedicate research to topics of conversation that he guessed might provoke one of Richard’s terse expressions or a tirade from Ralph’s that might stretch intermittently from one coffee break to the next.
Ralph was unable to tolerate any kind of journalism that allowed the personality or activities of the writer to intrude upon the story. Any text which Matthew submitted that offended this sensibility was ruthlessly excised.
-Just the facts lad. No-one is interested in how you came by them or how difficult it all was. This is not the Washington Post. You don’t go to the circus to hear the lion tamer lecture about the hours he spent persuading the lion not to bite his head off, do you?
-I don’t go to circuses. I don’t like them.
-Well then, don’t try and make a circus of this office. If our readers wanted to be dazzled by writers who have to explain how clever they are, they would buy one of the nationals. Just the facts.
-I don’t see what you have against editorial.
-Our readers aren’t eager to look under the surface of things, or to have it suggested that their preconceptions may be wrong. They are satisfied to have the surface of things described to them succinctly. From this they are able to deduce that the world is precisely as they have always imagined it to be. 
-We only offer them bland reassurance then?
-You say that as if it was a bad thing.
Another thing Ralph could not stand was the media self consciously discussing itself; newspapers and television programmes about what the other newspapers and television programmes were reporting. There seemed to be more of it all the time. Richard was malicious enough to set him off, reminding Ralph of the quote about the media being the message. 
-Some ignorant people may have said that, replied Ralph, but if you analyse what they intend to signify by their words, you will find that they are only making noises with their mouths that are literally meaningless except to make a pattern of sound. It is the sort of language I hear from business manager´s, calculated to impress rather than communicate, and I know that you, Richard, have only mentioned it to wind me up.
Matthew thought that perhaps the rant could be extended.
-You don’t like managers much do you Ralph?
-I prefer to converse with those who have some idea of what they are talking about, which a professional manager, by definition, does not, since his supposed skill is to manage the efforts of others. As Shaw said, those who can, do.
-I really feel that you need to explain this to me more fully. 
-An editorial conference?
-Indeed.
Invariably the lunchtime conferences occurred in Ralph´s favourite pub and were lubricated by enthusiastic sampling of the local brewer´s chief product.
It was almost a happy time for Matthew. He left Carol with the house and moved into a small flat in the centre of town, overlooking the river. It was a new development, put up at the time when builders were just beginning to think about riverside apartments as an alternative to starter homes in the suburbs. Matthew was one of the first buyers, on David’s advice. 
Financially, it turned out to be the best thing he ever did. Prices climbed so quickly that by the end of the first year he would not have been able to afford the place. There were drawbacks, however. Being close to the town centre meant that it was easy for friends to visit.
Late one night, he received an unexpected call from Ralph. Matthew had never had a work colleague call him before. All the journalists shared telephone numbers, but their kind of news was not normally made outside office hours. It was surprising to him that Ralph had been able to find his number.
A moment listening to Ralph´s voice made it clear that he was drunk; hopelessly and helplessly so. The level of his voice on the line kept changing, as he struggled to keep the phone at a steady distance from his face. His speech was slurred. There was a lot of noise in the background, including a bass heavy beat. Matthew closed his eyes and tried to imagine Ralph in a music bar. 
-You have to come and get me, Ralph told him.
-Get a taxi Ralph, it’s late.
-Not possible. You have to come. Need some assistance.
-Are you OK? You’re not hurt?
-Little bit drunk, I think.
-It’s one thirty in the morning. I … oh, all right. Where are you?
-Don’t know. Come as quick as you can. 
Matthew managed to talk Ralph through the process of discovering which bar he was patronising. Fortunately it was a place Matthew knew. By the time he had walked there and persuaded the doorman to let him in, the crowd inside was thinning. Ralph was conspicuous at the bar by virtue of being double the age of anyone else and because he was still wearing his office suit. 
-Hope I haven’t caused too much trouble. 
He could still barely speak and there seemed to be a real danger of him falling off the stool. Matthew helped him to stand. He started to move, but stooped down. 
-Mustn’t forget my briefcase. 
-Have you been drinking since five thirty?
-Well, no. Left the office early today. So, little bit longer than that. Think it’s time to go home now though. Where’s your car?
-I didn’t bring the car. I had some wine earlier. Let’s get you home. A walk to the taxi rank will do you good. 
Matthew had assumed that some disaster must have happened to Ralph to put him in such a state. Had he finally pushed Elliot too far, and been sacked? But, it seemed that there was no reason for the self destructive urge taking hold; none that Ralph could explain anyway.
Matthew had intended only to make sure that Ralph reached the taxi, but as they walked together, he began to worry that Ralph would not be capable of getting from the car into his house, even if the driver found his place. He could barely walk with Matthew’s support. Since Ralph lived alone, anything might happen to him. 
-Listen. We’ll stop in at mine. It’s on the way. I’ll make you a coffee, only no throwing up, okay.
-Don’t ever throw up sadly. Feel better if I did. Knew I could rely on you. Told Richard. Sound chap. 
The stairs were difficult. Eventually, Matthew got Ralph settled onto the sofa, if settled was the right word. He was sitting bolt upright with his hands in his lap, swaying slightly; an expression of utmost concentration on his face. Although his motor functions seemed all but extinct, Ralph’s speech was rational, if slurred. Matthew decided that his colleague wasn’t in any physical danger, but he went to the kitchen to make coffee, expecting that when he came back, Ralph would be toppled back on the sofa with his mouth open, unconscious. 
In fact, Ralph seemed to rally a little. 
-Thanks, coffee. Good idea. No milk lots of sugar. That’s the way. Said to Richard could rely on you, sound chap.
Matthew sat opposite. He saw that there was an ugly bruise beginning to develop on Ralph’s jaw, which he had not noticed before. 
-Did you have a fall?
-No, of course not. Don’t fall over. What do you take me for? Oh, you mean this. No this was something different. 
-What happened?
-Nothing important. Was in the bar, minding my own business, a bit unsteady. Place was crowded, you had to stand. Some young chap, never seen him before. Little fellow, came running at me from nowhere. Launched himself at me. Gave me this and ran off. Didn’t see where he went. Was on the floor I’m afraid. Not so bad if you’re making a nuisance of yourself. I’ve had worse when I deserved it. But a bit thick when you’re behaving. 
-Did you complain?
-Don’t be silly.
-You must have done something to annoy him.
-I suppose I didn’t fit. The suit you know; and I don’t look so young as I used to. Sometimes it’s enough if you seem just a bit different. 
Matthew had a closer look, but there did not seem to be any serious injury.
-What’s in the bag?
-Oh, that. My column for evening edition tomorrow. Wrote it while I was drinking. Not in that bar: earlier. Here, you’d better read it through. Check it makes sense.
Matthew took the notes. Ralph wrote longhand with an elaborate but very clear style. The article was perfectly legible, spare and elegant prose. The content didn’t seem like anything that would induce serious drinking in the writer. 
-Nothing wrong with it.
-Good. Oh, there’s this as well. Your piece on the new floral gardens. I had to pull it. 
-Why?
-It’s shit. But don’t worry you can redo it tomorrow. Won’t spoil for a day. 
-What do you mean, it’s shit?
The question seemed to sober Ralph up, at least temporarily.
-Not good enough. You can do better. Here look, take it. I’ve ringed the worst bits. You’ll see what I mean. It’s all Wordsworth this and Shakespeare that. It won’t do. You’ve actually typed “in the words of the Immortal Bard” there. We can’t have something that bad in the Examiner. 
-But it’s only a few hundred words to support all the advertising we’ve been chasing from them. Who cares? Besides, you use quotations all the time.
-It’s the Examiner Matthew, so I care. Don’t sulk. Quotation is permissible if the words express a complex idea succinctly or in a way that makes the reader think. Otherwise only when your reader or interlocutor is someone who will catch your reference. Then it can be a kind of shorthand that saves a longer explanation. Language is about signifiers. An author’s name might stand for, say, a particular outlook, between individuals who understand that language. But mostly, such individuals do not read our reports of flower shows. 
Ralph was suddenly and temporarily lucid.
-You throw references at me every day that I hardly ever catch, Matthew objected. 
-Because I am doing you the compliment of preferring to think of you as half-educated rather than fully ignorant. 
-And what about that theatre review you had in last week? Hedda Gabler. That was full of fragments of quotes and references that no one would make head or tail of.
-Ibsen, you idiot. It was a theatre review. The people who read that would have been disappointed if they could understand it. They read about the flowers to see whether it would be worth a trip over to the show in the motor on Sunday. They scan a review of Ibsen to be reassured that culture is going on somewhere in the city. Heaven forbid they should have to sit through it. 
-In any case, my sin is no justification for yours. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone? That’s nonsense: if we believed that, there would be no literary criticism whatsoever. Hypocrisy is ubiquitous, thank god. Without it the world wouldn’t turn at all.
Finally, the conversation appeared to have exhausted Ralph entirely. He fell asleep almost at the moment that these final words were out of his mouth, sitting where he was on the couch. 

***

Matthew realised that he had an unhealthy relationship with alcohol, like almost everyone else he knew. In fact, all his relationships with people other than his family revolved around alcohol. He suspected that alcohol was destroying them all; whether it was the quick spiral to oblivion that seemed to have taken Tim away from them, or the binge drinking that rendered Ralph helpless from time to time. On the other hand it was impossible for him to imagine his world without drink. The only way to change would be to move to a new place and start everything again. 
And on reflection, he decided that he probably wouldn’t be like Tim or Ralph: more likely he would just become so soaked through with regular drinking that he no longer knew or cared what was happening to him. 
The next morning, he had no sooner got Ralph out the door and started to prepare for work, than he remembered that he was invited to David’s house in the evening. 
There was some mystery about it too. David had made a point of saying that he needed to be there. But when Matthew arrived, later than usual and a little tired from his dealings with Ralph, he only saw the usual crowd. The one person who looked out of place was a plump little Asian in a business suit, bald on top, looking a little bit middle aged for this company. He looked to be engrossed in conversation with some people at the far end of the room and Matthew had no particular urge to hear what they might have to say. He assumed that this man was a new client of David’s. 
Matthew then considered what he should have to drink. Perhaps if he went in for a night without alcohol, once a week say, he would not feel so run down all the time. The difficulty was; what to choose. He thought about lemonade, a juice, maybe water. In the end he settled for a bottled beer. It felt like a reasonable compromise. 
From nowhere David appeared at his shoulder, with the new client in tow. 
-Say hello to someone you already know, Matt.
Annoying David. It was so easy for him. He was able to recall not only the names but important life details of everyone he met. It was part of his charm armour. He claimed there was just a trick to it and that you didn’t need a fantastic memory. He’d even offered to teach Matthew the trick, but Matthew had told him no thanks. So why was David embarrassing him now, hanging him out to dry with this Indian businessman, who he’d probably met once before at some civic function and forgotten instantly. 
-He doesn’t remember me David.
It was true, but now that he spoke, the voice was familiar.
-It can’t be. Abbas?
-Hello my friend. It’s not your fault I have changed so much. Everyone calls me Albert these days. It was easier in certain circumstances and the name has stuck. 
David laughed, and said that he had to speak with some of the other company but he would catch them later. For once Matthew did not resent being the spare social appendage for the evening. 
-You too have a lot of catching up to do, David said.
But the next day, thinking it over, Matthew realised that Abbas, or Albert as he now was, had said very little about himself or what he had been doing; only that he travelled a lot. It had been fascinating to talk with him at length, and in a way he was just like before: always wanting to talk about the world of the mind, forever analysing the world around him. Only now he spoke about serious things with great levity. At times Matthew was not even sure that he was not being quietly made fun of. Yes, they had spoken about politics, about travel, and about the world in general, but about Albert himself; who he was these days and what had made him so; he had said nothing.
Over the next weeks they saw a lot of Albert. In the years he’d been away, he seemed to have read and seen everything. On general principles, Matthew decided he must be some kind of fraud. He made pronouncements about the world in general that sounded as if they came from books, without any apparent self-consciousness. No one had such a range of knowledge; or if they did, they would not express it so freely as Albert was in the habit of doing. And why the reticence about himself? No-one even knew where he was living.
But Albert was good company and more interesting than the self- important businessmen who Matthew normally found himself stranded with at David´s. In his old fashioned way he was as charming as David himself. So here was another problem for Matthew to brood on: why did he sometimes find himself downright irritated by the man? Perhaps it was no more than his own weak character that gave in to petty jealousy. First David and now Abbas, or whatever he wants to call himself, he thought. I´m becoming a bitter and resentful person; blaming the world for my own failings. There´s no reason for me to be suspicious of either of them.

***

In one way at least, the transformation of skinny, serious Abbas into fat, funny Albert, was like that of a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis. Although Albert´s speech sounded pompous, he took nothing seriously, including himself. His conversation fluttered around every subject. He seemed to know everything and have an original opinion on it all, but he had also discovered the knack of ending a monologue before it became tedious. 
He took a particular delight in talking to Matthew, for no good reason that Matthew could see. Perhaps he was amused by Matthew´s clumsy, earnest manner; his inability to make polite conversation or to keep his mouth shut when silence was the best option. Neither had a regular partner and both spent much of their free time at David´s house. David referred to them more than once as his resident professors, as if he were a renaissance prince and they his tame savants.
They all spent nights together in the downstairs room at the back of the house that David liked to call his snug. It was the shabbiest room in the house, too small and poorly lit to be of much use, but all the social evenings seemed to gravitate there in the end. A small bar was set up against the back wall, with an impressive selection of spirits on the shelves behind. As students, none of them had drunk spirits, but now David took pride in offering a range of single malts as well as a selection of obscure liquors and mixers. There was a small glass fronted refrigerator for the beer.
So far as Patricia was concerned, the furniture in the snug was the stuff of nightmares: David described it as comfortably ruined: mis-matched leathers and outmoded cloths shiny with wear, but cosy enough. The place was a male refuge from the prim chic of the rest of the house, and Patricia respected it as such, claiming that this was cheaper and safer than allowing David a shed in which to develop home improvement skills.
Somehow Matthew and Albert were pitted against one another, verbally sparring all the time. Albert said Matthew was the only journalist he knew who had no curiosity about the world around him. Matthew replied that his job was not to investigate things but provide words that were a comforting backdrop to everyday lives, a reassurance that everything was as his readers believed it to be. As he said the words he thought about Ralph telling him the same thing and how he’d felt when he first heard it. Matthew joked about the old Abbas he had known.
-You´ve changed so much. You used to be far too busy with important things like politics and economics and I don´t know what other –ics. You didn´t have time for trivialities like literature, and yet now you seem quite the authority.
-It´s true I used to imagine that the world was governed by logical principles if you could only understand them. I even thought I might be destined to play some small part in the great play. When one becomes disabused of such illusions, the consolations of literature become a comfort.
-You don´t believe in reason now?
-I´m afraid not. You know how the human brain developed: by adding new parts to the old. In the front part here we have grown fantastic abilities to do and think, but the further back you go, towards the spine, is where our motivations sit: the primitive lizard brain that has hardly changed at all. And so we live in chaos, driven on by urges we don´t understand and hardly control.
-It sounds like a frightening world.
-But I came to see it as inevitable. If we evolved so far as to be fully logical, we´d have no reason to do anything. We´d only sit in our rooms and we waste away.
Sometimes it seemed that Albert practically lived at the house for long periods: then he would disappear suddenly. When he came back he might pick up the thread of a conversation that he´d been having with Matthew three weeks earlier, without any explanation. He seemed to work on a different time scale to the rest of them. 
One night there were four of them in the snug: Albert, David and Matthew, and some woman whose name Matthew did not remember, though he half suspected that she was hanging on because she was interested in him. She was very drunk. They all were; even David could not have been sober, though he gave no sign of intoxication. Matthew supposed that Patricia was somewhere in the house, probably working on a legal brief. 
David insisted on serving more good whisky, though none of them needed or even wanted it. The woman asked for some water. Matthew decided that she was probably going to be sick in a short time and resolved to keep well away from her. Albert was saying something about eastern systems of belief compared to western thought. It was one of those meandering conversations that take their own course; so that the end seems to bear no relation to the beginning, unless perhaps the end and the beginning are in the same place. 
He was talking about being able to accept the truth of different propositions even if they were contradictory. Albert claimed that western thought lost more than it gained by insisting on their being only one version of the truth. He said that approach was too literal minded. David commented that it was useful to have a single consistent world view if, for example, you wanted to build a bridge or send a rocket into space.
Albert was speaking with the exaggerated dignity of the truly inebriated. He claimed that the world itself was contradictory and inconsistent. To understand it you must be able to maintain beliefs on different levels. Being comfortable with ambiguity, he called it. He was playing to his audience as usual, carried away by the sound of his own words: You could see that David was enjoying himself too. Matthew thought that most of what Albert was saying sounded impressive enough, without actually meaning anything. Now David interrupted.
-I´m not against mysticism, I´ve had mystical experiences myself. The effect has been formative. I remember once, I must have been about thirteen, and we were on a family holiday in Lakeland. My mother had just died and I was pretty upset and confused. She was very young. Anyway, everyone was off on one of my father’s route marches across three counties, and I refused to go. I was sulking I suppose. But later on in the day I went out walking on my own in the hills and the bad weather came in, and I became lost. I was up there for hours; no proper clothing, and suffering from hypothermia and exhaustion. I even started hallucinating I think. The point is I survived, even though I had no right to. You see I’d done every stupid thing, and everything that could go wrong did, and by all logic I should have died, but I didn’t. And you know, ever since that, I’ve had the feeling that it wasn’t me getting myself through the situation, but that I was saved. And I came to think that if I was saved, it must have been for a purpose. 
-He tells a different version of that story every few weeks, said Matthew, who had become quite tired of hearing it. Just be grateful you heard the short one.
-But the point of the story, David insisted, is that it’s true; it expresses a truth.
Matthew did not say anything. He only wondered whether, in David’s mind, being true and expressing a truth meant the same thing.

***

Rodney had warned Patricia about Smith before their meeting. He went so far as to say that she might not thank him for instructing her in this case. That was stupid. Rodney was the defence solicitor and Patricia would be defence counsel in a murder trial – it was the chance she had been waiting for. Hardly surprising if the defendant was not a charming person. The sort of lawyer who worried about that would have no place at the criminal bar.
 According to Rodney, his client had insisted on having a female brief speak for him. 
-Maybe he thinks he’ll be able to bully me into running some stupid argument he’s dreamed up. We’ll see about that.
Rodney smiled. He thought of himself as something of an uncle figure for Patricia, but he knew from the specific enquiry he had made of her clerk that she had not dealt with a case like this before. She was bright enough, but talking as if she knew it all fooled neither of them. 
-Smith is a nasty piece of work even by the standard of your average violent criminal, he warned her. Most murderers are not like proper crims. They just do the one crime, usually at home, and maybe it’s due to bad luck or bad character or both. Often they deny guilt only because they can’t face up to it, even in their own heads. With that type you might think, if they let him go, probably no chance he’d do it again. Not that I’m saying that’s what should happen. Anyway, with Smith, you don’t have that impression. 
-Well, he’s not most murderers is he? He’s an alleged offender who is our client, and I believe he’s saying he is not guilty. So it’s our job to get him acquitted if we can. 
Rodney only snorted at this. 
They were at the prison. Naturally Smith was remanded in custody. Every time Patricia went there, she had the thought that for a first time inmate, the place must be enough to make them doubt there own innocence and maybe everything else they thought they knew. Perhaps that was the point of it: the combination of Victorian Gothic in the architecture and Stalinist utilitarianism in the rooms and corridors, like this one with its bare walls, sparse plastic and formica tables and chairs that seemed too small for the room; tube metal framed with the metal discreetly chained to the floor. Something miserable and hopeless had been rubbed into the furniture by successive generations of offenders. It wouldn’t drive you crazy so much as make you think you may as well just give up the struggle against fate.
Whilst they waited for the guards to bring the prisoner, Patricia went over in her mind what she knew about the case. Simple enough. Husband comes home from work, argues with wife, stabs wife, wife dies. Families shouldn’t argue around kitchen cutlery. Husband makes feeble attempt to conceal body and flees. Daughter finds wife dead when she comes home from school. Husband arrested.
Soon, Smith arrived in person: an ugly, scrawny man with an overlong neck and thinning black hair that might have been dyed. Patricia had the impression that his eyes were very cold, too calm, and flickering about the room all the time as if looking for something he could use. She told herself the appearance meant nothing. He’s taken a life; don’t fall into the trap of thinking there is particular significance in his face just because of that fact. But still, a jury are not going to like him. She tried to imagine what he might have looked like to the victim, when they were first married: she couldn’t do it.
Smith walked up to them and sat down at the free chair, ignoring their polite standing up by way of greeting. Still he had not met the gaze of either of them. He sat facing slightly away from Patricia; then he inclined his head and grinned at her in a cockeyed way. Perhaps that is an acceptable greeting in his circle, she thought. Don’t be too quick to judge: sometimes nervousness comes over as aggression. 
Smith turned to Rodney for a moment.
-Pretty enough, he said. How’s it going Mr Jackson? Did you get my smokes?
-There you go Oscar, call me Rodney, his solicitor replied. 
-Right you are. And this is…?
-Patricia.
-Nice.
It was easy to see that it was important to Smith to have the feeling of being in charge. He paused for a moment, giving the cigarettes his full attention. Then he grinned again. 
-What’s the news?
-It isn’t looking good, Rodney answered. They have a good set of prints from the knife, and there’s the blood on your clothes. 
Smith shrugged.
-It’s not as if there is any doubt who put the knife in poor Edith. I mean I left it inside her. I wasn’t going to pull it out. It was horrible.
Patricia spoke next.
-But you did stab her more than once Mr Smith.
-That was when I didn’t know what I was doing.
-And have you finally decided how you are going to plead.
-Not guilty, same as I told the magistrates. Not guilty to murder; guilty to manslaughter with diminished responsibility. Me being so upset about what she said to me that I didn’t have any idea what I was doing. I expect you can agree that in advance with your chum in the prosecution. 
Rodney sighed.
-It doesn’t look like the prosecution will agree to that. Patricia will explain why.
-They think they have a lot of additional evidence, Oscar. For one thing the knife was taken from the kitchen, but the incident was in the main bedroom, which raises the issue of premeditation. It doesn’t look spur of the moment you see. Also they have records of your wife being treated for earlier injuries that seemed to be…domestic in origin. Prosecution will say that you were violent to her in the past. And the other main thing is that you say she told you that she’d been seeing someone else for months and that she was going to leave and take your daughter with her, but there is no evidence that such a lover ever existed or that your wife ever saw anyone else. You can’t give us a name, and friends and family say there was no such person and that it’s a story you have invented. 
-Well if you can’t find him, maybe Edith invented him, have you thought of that? I can only tell you what she told me. Maybe she imagined it would be easier to leave me that way. I wasn’t to know was I?
-There’s also the times you threatened her, in the presence of other people, Rodney interrupted. There’s one statement that you told her you would rip her guts out.
-Yeah, well people say all sorts, and then after a tragedy like this, it gets exaggerated. Doesn’t mean I intended to do anything. Patricia can explain that, it’s what you people do. I mean, we had a tempestuous relationship, but it was a loving one. Fifteen years. 
-What about the beatings Oscar? There will be medical reports.
-I was coming to that. It’s a bit delicate, with a young lady present as well. The truth is; poor Edith liked it a little rough, though it’s embarrassing to say. Got her more excited. Sorry miss.
-You don’t need to worry about making me blush Oscar. But the records show that there were three hospital attendances in the last two years for fractures. That would be more than a little rough.
-Oh but they weren’t any part of that. That was just accidents in the home, like she told them when she went to the hospital. I mean, I expect that’s what she told them, because it’s true. Poor Edith you know, she was a good mother, good around the home, but clumsy like. Always in the wars even from when she was a little kid. 
Patricia paused in her note taking. 
-So the story is that your wife of fifteen years, who liked rough sex and was accident prone, told you one day that she was fed up  and had been seeing a man, who doesn’t seem to exist, and that she was intending to set up home with him and your daughter?
-I love my daughter. She’s the apple of my eye. I’d do anything for her.
-And as a result of that discussion, you rushed downstairs, grabbed a kitchen knife, ran back upstairs and stabbed your wife, is it three times or four, all before you had time to think?
-Maybe I took the knife only intending to frighten her with it: to make her calm down. Yes, that feels more like it. I couldn’t bear to lose her and I thought if I could stop her leaving at that moment I would be able to talk her round. 
Patricia tried to fix Smith with a stare, but the man’s eyes were never still. 
-Oscar, my job is to tell your story in the best way it can be told, but it has to be your own story. What you are telling us now…
-It’s god’s truth Patricia.
-That’s between you and God. It doesn’t matter what I believe personally. What matters, and what I have to advise you to think about, is that it seems to me very unlikely that a jury would believe that story. And I also have to tell you that the court would be harder on you if you were found guilty after putting the family through a trial and making allegations about your wife without any proof. 
-What family? I’m her family. Don’t forget I am a victim of this situation as well. 
-Edith’s mother? Her sister, your daughter?
-I never liked her mother or her sister, gobby cows. You’re not getting the wind up are you Pat?
-What do you mean?
-Don’t think you’re up to persuading them? I wanted a woman brief because, well the story sounds more credible coming from a woman. But if you don’t think you’re up to the job…
-Oscar, you’re out of order there, said Rodney.
-It’s fine; he can say what he likes. I’m not too delicate to put your case how you want it, if that’s what you mean. 
-Exactly, I’m relieved to hear you say that, cos that’s how it is ain’t it? You have to work for me. You do what I say. 
The grin had become a sneer or something worse, even though Smith still did not meet Patricia’s gaze.
-And you might have to lay it on thick as well. Find a better way to say it. That’s what you people do isn’t it, to justify your fancy fees?
On the way back in the car, Patricia did cry a little but without breaking down entirely. She asked Rodney to drop her at home as she didn’t believe she could face chambers. She was looking forward to a long shower or a bath. Rodney said that Smith knew he was going down and that he was taking his enjoyment from hurting as many women as possible on the way, Patricia included. He talked about getting her off the case, but Patricia would not hear of it. 
-He can have his enjoyment. I’m going to do the best job I can for him , and I hope you won’t think me unprofessional if I say that I’ll be hoping he is convicted. 
-I’ll forget I heard that, but yes. 
It was a three day trial: at the end the jury retired for not more than twenty minutes before returning a verdict of guilty to murder. Patricia didn’t remember the conversation she had with Smith after he left the dock. There was no question of an appeal. She did remember and could never forget the expressions of mingled hate and contempt that were directed at her from the public gallery and the jury box during the course of the proceedings. 
You can’t wash that off, she thought. It was something I thought I knew about but then it wasn’t what I imagined. And it’s not what I thought I would do. I was supposed to make things better not worse. 
Something had changed in her. She was becoming cynical, and everything she found in the world seemed to confirm that cynicism. The realisation gave her a feeling close to panic, as if her living body were being encased in ice or stone and she could feel the crust of it rising up over her. She felt desperate to discover a flame that must continue to burn within, that would redeem her and lead her back to a state of grace, if only she could find some object worthy of it. 

Chapter Seven

In February 1988, David announced, to general astonishment, that he was giving up the law and selling his interest in the partnership. He had come so far, and so quickly, that no-one, his partners included, could understand what he was thinking of. 
Matthew said the same as everyone else; that he was doing fantastically well and it would be madness to give up now. David replied that the only thing he was doing well was making money.
And the most profitable work is mostly just buying and selling houses and other kinds of property. Anyone could do it; it’s only that the agents and accountants and bank managers like me, so they send me the business.
Besides, he added, everyone knew there was a crash coming. These good times were going away and probably not coming back. 
-But there’s more to it than that. There’s more to life. I can feel it. We are put here to do some good, you know, not just to survive.
Matthew suggested that if he felt that way, perhaps he could take on some more deserving cases, maybe go back to doing voluntary sessions at the advice centre, the way he and Patricia had done in the early days. 
-Patricia is a saint, and I’m not. I couldn’t get away from the place quickly enough, if I’m honest. I only kept going because she did. It was like the drama group at college all over again, all that embarrassment just to be close to her, following her round pretending to be interested. Don’t get me wrong, I was happy enough to put the time in if I could believe that it might be some use, it wasn’t that I resented. Just week after week the same futile complaints. Half of the people I saw were suffering terrible unfairness and there was generally nothing I could do to help them. It was just a case of explaining that they used to have rights; but our wonderful government had recently removed them.  The rest of them were looking for tips on how to play the system to their advantage. It was a game with them to see if I could get them to give me the true facts f their case before they worked out from my advice what story they should tell me. 
-Patricia still thinks that kind of work matters.
-And she’s right, but you know what she’s like. She thinks of her whole career as a charitable project. She imagines these toe rags and thieves she deals with are the working classes, needing assistance to better themselves. You and I are working class ourselves, so we know better. If you live in a street of fifteen families all more or less with the same start in life, and one is a family of villains, you don’t think that maybe you ought to befriend them and try to help them. You just make sure your own kids don’t play with theirs, in case whatever is wrong with them kids rubs off. My dad thought that working class meant you worked, except when our rulers and bosses had messed things up so badly that there was no work to be had. You generally find that socialist lawyers come from comfortable homes: it gives them that romantic view of stealing and cheating. 
David explained that when he thought about doing some good, he had in mind the ordinary people, the ones who were not complete screw-ups. 
-In that case, Matthew asked him, what will you do?
-You know the old Cromwell engineering works.
-What about it?
-It’s for sale.
-Of course it’s for sale, it’s going under: everyone knows that.
David frowned.
-It’s true that the order book is nearly exhausted and the MoD contract is uncertain. Nearly 400 jobs at risk, most of them highly skilled.
-David I told you about that two months ago. We even printed it in the paper.
-I’m going to buy the company.
-How, what are you going to use for money? No, wait, why? Why would you do that even if you could raise the money?
-My father spent most of his working life in engineering. It’s precision work. Unbelievably skilled. What they do there is a craft. It would be like closing a pit, once you shut it down you can never get it back ever.
-So you are going to make yourself bankrupt together with them, to show solidarity?
-It can be turned around Matthew. What is it we keep saying, about businesses let down by stupid, short-sighted management? It’s time to do something more than talk about it. 
David explained that the business was a private company “but we’ll take it to the stock market in two years”. He had some financial backers but yes, there would be a lot of debt, and risk for him. Patricia understood all of this and had complete faith in him
-You make it sound as if something that is definitely going to happen.
David smiled.
-It’s all arranged. We are signing the contract and completing next week. I hope you’ll be able to cover the celebrations for the paper, and join us of course. There’ll be quite a party.
-Wait a minute David, you’re talking about making the world a better place, but the main part of Cromwell’s business is making parts for tanks. How does that fit in your scheme to help the world?
David spoke, rather unconvincingly Matthew thought, about the need to find new, peacetime markets, and how it wasn’t as if Cromwell’s was a supplier of weapons: they turned out precision castings for a variety of uses. Tank treads were only one item on the product list. He was more enthusiastic when he spoke about his hopes for developing new technology.
-We are inventors and innovators of the world in this country Matt. Look at Chobham armour, developed in England. Who else would have thought of using ceramic tiles as armour? It’s light, nothing gets through it. Of course the Americans actually have most of it because it’s too expensive for our army. But imagine the excitement of developing something as new and radical as that.
Matthew did not bother to argue further. He had seen that look of enthusiasm and unshakeable confidence in David’s face before, and he knew that words were powerless against it. So the deal was done.
The newspapers treated David as if he was a new kind of hero, stepping in to save the factory from certain closure. Afterwards there were regular articles and photographs continuing to show the local benefactor in a positive light. 
However, at first things did not seem to go well with the business, and David’s friends feared that it had all been a disastrous mistake. Week by week it was a case of finding the money to pay wages and keep the plant open somehow, not knowing whether that week would be the last, or how long the banks would remain patient. 
Before long David himself appeared to have been physically reduced by the stress, worried looking, almost hesitant. He lost weight. He even looked shorter than before, if that were possible. And still the new orders did not come in quickly enough. Just when he most needed the bright aura of invulnerability that had always surrounded him, it seemed to be fading away.
He began to spend more and more time away from home; chasing business, living in hotels, eating and drinking too much. He looked swollen but still he lost weight. In private, his eyes looked haunted, though in public a receptive audience or any kind of social gathering in which he could shine would see him temporarily restored to his former self.
There was a change in Patricia too. She was alone in the big house so much. Her own legal career had become successful, but it seemed that this was no longer enough. She was lonely. She explained to Matthew that often, now, David was absent even if he happened to be at home. His thoughts were not with her.
And she started to drink more: not so that she became an embarrassing drunk, but so that a bottle of wine in a day stopped making her sick and started to feel normal. The wine didn’t coarsen her behaviour, but it made her conversation more forthright. She started to tell people just what she thought about things. It was not always comfortable to hear.
-I never liked you that much Matthew, she confided, and I suppose you knew it and have probably never thought too much of me either. Ironic, don’t you think? That it seems that you and I are now stuck with each other. While he is away doing…what he does, all across the world, here we are like the old married couple.
In fact Matthew was surprised to hear that Patricia noticed him sufficiently to find him irritating. He was so used to ignoring who people were, as opposed to what they said and thought, that he imagined himself similarly invisible to others. It was true that he was spending more time at the house, and that he and Patricia were alone together more often, now that David was so much on the road. At first Matthew had seen his visits as a kind of duty, but now he began to question his motivation. 
Naturally it was Patricia who took charge. They were in the kitchen at the time, each holding a large and delicate thin stemmed glass in which a splash of clear white wine glittered. Matthew remembered it as the second or third bottle. The kitchen was the very opposite of the snug: all natural wood, expensive tiles, discreet and exquisite ceramic designs and functional polished steel. It was Patricia’s own space as much as the snug was David’s
Matthew was sitting at the breakfast bar on a stool that was much too fashionable to be comfortable. Patricia was standing, perhaps a little too close to him. He didn´t remember what they were speaking about, but he remembered that Patricia stopped talking, but her glass down on the bar, and leaned in, gently taking his own glass. With her free hand she lightly brushed his cheek, and something about that gesture felt electric.
-You know there´s no way you can drive home tonight Matt, you’ve had far too much to drink, she said. 
She pulled him towards her, stronger than he expected and kissed him fully on the mouth. Matthew managed not to fall off the stool. Then he was standing awkwardly, not resisting her embrace.
-Hold me properly. I´m not going to sleep on my own again tonight. Shit, Matthew, I can´t do it. I can´t be alone like this. I´m going to have to sin it seems. Better with an old friend than with a stranger, don´t you think?
She took him to her bed that night and a few more times in the weeks that followed. Afterwards, she talked to him about David. 
They both knew that it was not to be the grand passion of their lives, and in Patricia´s case the sex was more like first aid for some wounded part of herself than love. Matthew felt more relief than loss when Patricia told him that their cursory affair was over.
-I’m sending you back to your wounded brunettes and washed out blondes, was how she put it. 
She said she felt sorry for those girls.
-I know how your mind works. Part of you is already planning how you are going to get rid of them before you have even get to know the poor deluded things. 
It seemed that the price of intimacy was that Patricia could be more brutally frank with him than before. Matthew denied that it was so, but the words stung. Sometimes Patricia spoke as if she did not recognize the line between the honesty of friends and spitefulness.
Matthew did not notice any change in the relationship between Patricia and her husband, but between himself and Patricia, some new and lasting bond that was not that of lovers had been created. It was not tender, and in fact Patricia showed no greater sign of liking him than before, but now she felt that she could talk to him about anything. There were things she told him that he was sure she would not discuss with David, though in the end her private concerns mostly had to do with David. At times, Matthew felt as if he had been recruited as a counsellor, not a lover.
And Matthew was surprised at his own attitude to having broken David’s trust.  His first feeling was some mild guilt, mixed with a perverse joy that he realized was a sense of being revenged. He had no idea why he should want to seek revenge on David. He had to ask himself once more whether he had always secretly resented David´s success, and his own failure. But with the passage of time, he came to feel as if nothing important had changed. 
And on the outside at least, nothing had changed. Their lives carried on as before and Matthew, if he thought about it at all, reasoned that the times with Patricia had just been a release for both of them. It was a footnote in the story of their lives and no more. David was still away a lot, but Matthew was careful never to ask Patricia whether she found anyone else to ease her loneliness. That was the only question he could not ask.
He usually met her at lunchtimes now. It was easy since they both worked in the city. Most times they went to the same restaurant. They even ordered the same dishes, like the old couple they had, in some ways, become. And once, long after the familiar pattern of their relationship had been re-established, she said something unexpected to him there as they were waiting for the bill.
-I do love my husband you know.
-Why should I doubt it?
-He’s not very…attentive.
-He is very busy, always.
-But you shouldn’t be critical of him for that, Patricia insisted, as if Matthew had ever criticised David in her hearing. It’s not just about the business you know, it’s more than that. It’s more even than the people depending on him.
-What else could there be?
-Something more, something indefinable. He knows that he is meant to do something important. He´s not quite down here on this earth like the rest of us.
Matthew could only sigh. There it was again, imagined fate, haunting them all. It seemed that David had persuaded at least one other person of the sense of destiny that drove him on. For Matthew, the obsession was only a conceit of the ego; but it was no less fascinating, and appalling, to watch this small idea shaping the lives of his friends, maybe even of his own life.

***

David might have left the law firm, but Albert remained a constant presence in the gatherings at the Thomas household. Perhaps he had once been David´s client, but it was evident that their hidden relationship went deeper than that. Matthew did not understand why Albert hung around, but he could have said the same about himself. 
His own relationship with Albert had changed. Albert was the same as always: pompous, entertaining, pedantic and not entirely serious in the outrageous statements he came out with. But now Matthew started to find these same characteristics tiresome and irritating, rather than amusing. The polite intellectual sparring that Matthew had previously enjoyed could provoke him to real anger now. 
Some part of him knew that it was all about David really. There was a spark of sentimentality in Matthew that was outraged at David making money from owning a business that had a military connection; however far removed it might be from actually making weapons. That David should be a businessman at all was offensive to Matthew in a way that he did not entirely understand, but in any case it was impossible that he should express these vague feelings to David directly. It was not logical, but he found that the anger he reserved for his friend and could not express was transferred to David´s more or less permanent guest. 
Albert chose not to notice any change between himself and Matthew. He remained his charming urbane self, but everyone else could feel the tension growing between them. It was a problem for Patricia: a little aggression added to the social evenings prevented the atmosphere becoming fatuous, but nobody wanted to witness a scene. On the other hand she and David could hardly withdraw the standing invites of two of their closest friends. Privately she told Matthew to stop making an ass of himself and to leave Albert alone if he couldn´t get on with him. Matthew said he would try, but he had become a moth to the flame; unable to ignore whatever it was about Albert that had started to annoy him. 
Then in the snug one night they got talking about Africa. You got the impression Albert had spent some time there, the way he talked. Of course his family had moved from Uganda. But the truth was that Albert talked about everything as if he knew all there was to know about it. 
Matthew was a little drunk, but not more so than usual. Patricia was trying to make some point. It was the famine, in Ethiopia of course, and the Band Aid project and all the hopeful beginnings that seemed to grow out from that. She said she´d always thought that charities were useless, but maybe these events showed that ordinary people could make a difference: maybe she needed to change her mind
-It was the film of the children that made the difference for all of us, she said. Most people are decent. Once they are confronted by the horrible reality of suffering they demand a change. 
-I´m not sure, Matthew replied. I thought that about the Falklands war. It would be like in Vietnam: once people saw the reality the public support would disappear. But it was the opposite – the public couldn´t get enough. Our masters had learned how to manage the news I suppose, so our wars now can be entertainments.
-You can´t make a starving child entertaining Matt, Patricia sounded slightly shocked at the suggestion.
-No, but famine is nothing new. And we become accustomed to things so quickly. The coverage needs to be more explicit every time in order to shock us. I´m not sure that it´s healthy or where it ends. Shock is an instant emotion and then it´s gone. And I don´t know how much you can build on emotion.
-You can´t build anything without it Matt, Patricia insisted.
Albert was being unusually quiet.
In his mind, he was back in the horn of Africa. Sitting for days in that hotel, waiting for the Colonel to decide. Everyone was there; the whole gang from all the countries of the north. All of them with expensive toys to offer to the new emperor. The bastard had spent as much in that month, celebrating a decade of his revolution, as it would have cost to feed the people in the dry zone for ten years.
The hotel was not so bad. The obligatory five stars. The usual problems with air conditioning, food and bedding of course. Otherwise the place was fine. The plumbing carried the waste somewhere off site and beyond that you didn´t enquire. The pool had been dry, but none of them felt much like swimming. There was ice in the bar, if you were prepared to risk whatever organisms might be frozen in it, and they said that the water was good. Even the climate was pleasant once you got used to the slightly thin air. You could loiter in the avenues lined with eucalyptus trees and come across almost nothing to suggest that the Colonel had spent most of the last ten years murdering his opponents and waging war on sections of his own people. 
No one was supposed to leave the hotel without their official guide, but everyone did. It wasn´t so much that they were curious as that they were bored. It was easy enough to take a cab and sometimes the weyela would talk to you as his colleague drove you to your random destination.
It was just the beginning then, and he supposed that things got worse later, but in the capital you would not have known there was famine threatening the country. Even the officials seemed to have chosen not to believe in it. In the street you heard stories soon enough, if you kept your ears open, but it was difficult to know how much to believe. The Colonel felt obliged to give the media, at least the African media, some sort of access. He was head of the organization for African unity, after all. What you heard from those guys was bad enough and they were sure they had not seen the worst of it. 
Everyone knew that the harvest in the north had failed again. That was bad, but it was said that the government troops had actually been burning food stores in the affected regions. Nobody he talked to had seen it, but they all seemed to believe it.
He remembered that Ray Hawkins had been there; not to trade as he said, but only to look after a nervous little man from Turin who never seemed to leave his room. They were all wasting their time anyway: the Colonel suspected that anyone who spoke English was an agent of the hated Americans. The Colonel had all the Russian arms he needed. He even had troops from Cuba at his disposal, but the word was that he preferred to let hunger kill his enemies. 
Somehow Ray had sources of information. He said that the stories were true. The idea was to depopulate the rebel areas. Most of the rebels would be among the five million who might die. It was the traditional way, the Colonel said. In any case the land was overpopulated and with modern farming methods the country did not need so many peasants.
It sounded about right. Albert had heard enough about the regime not to have any illusions. He’d seen some of the street posters. “Temporary setbacks shall not deter us from our final objective of building communism” was the official view. Making a paradise for the poor if it meant killing most of them in the process.
They never met the Colonel, but they heard he was neither stupid nor corrupt, which seemed to make matters worse. The most frightening thing about the man was that he was sincere about his revolution.
Albert had wanted to find out more. Ray had asked him why he would want to know. Ray’s final words on the subject stuck in his mind. 
-I like you Albert. I don’t know why. But you´re not cut out for this business. You should get out now. All this death; it’s getting to you.
- It’s the same for you.
-But I don’t have your refined sensibilities. I’m not looking to make sense of it all the time. You know my philosophy. If someone gets in my way, he goes down before I do. I think I’m maybe what you would call a bad man, in that way. You’re not like me at all. 
He’d taken Ray’s advice to the extent of getting out of the country. Not long afterwards everything escalated and the world discovered the situation. It suited everyone after that to treat it as an undiscovered human disaster, even though all the governments had known what was going on, he supposed. He had only been an observer, just a little closer to the events than the people he was among now. But what could he tell any of them about it that would sound true? 
There are no accidents on the scale of genocide, he thought, and there are people in the world who can give the orders that such things should happen, not because they are sitting in a presidential palace isolated from the consequences, but because they have seen understood the consequences and willed that they should occur. And men like these live in all continents, not just in what we call the third world.
He had no words for these thoughts, and for once he felt out of place and wished he were far away from the polite and happy company. He hoped tonight they would leave him alone. But Matthew was talking to him, standing slightly too close, sounding too jolly.
-You’re fond of telling us about imperialism, aren’t you Albert?
-I’ve seen some of its effects in the world.
-I was saying that pictures of suffering don´t explain the causes and that´s what we need to understand. You can tell us about how the old empires affected what happened in Ethiopia
-Ethiopia wasn’t part of anyone’s empire. It was one of the oldest kingdoms in the world; independent for centuries except when the Italians invaded for a while. 
-But you know what I mean. Tell us, which was the worst colonial power, the English or the French?
Albert realised that Matthew was remembering words that they had exchanged a week earlier. He´d said that for all the atrocities committed by the Belgians and other Catholic invaders, the damage they did was limited in scale; primitive acts of savagery that were sustained by the promise that it hardly mattered if thousands of unbaptised heathens perished if the word of god could be brought to a few, and a good profit earned in the meantime. It was the patient English and Germans he said, with their systems and their administration, who were the most dangerous. In Africa at the turn of the century, the English had invented concentration camps and the Germans had perfected methods of extermination that obliterated the entire Herero people from the southern Cape.
-The French were not exactly Catholics, he´d said, but they imagine themselves philosophers, which is worse. There is no depth of egoism, vanity or sheer stupidity that a man will not stoop to in the name of philosophy. As for the English, if you believed their own words, they conquered half the globe only because wherever they found themselves, things were in a terrible mess that needed to be sorted out; only so that common sense and order should be established. And common sense sometimes looks so much like self interest that you can´t tell the difference. They were pragmatists, they preferred not to take out their motivations and examine them in the cold light of day. That was their strength.
That conversation was only a few days in the past, but tonight all the words seemed so trivial that Albert had no time for them.
-You seem very annoyed about something Matt. Is everything ok with you?
-Never better. Bit too much booze, that’s all. Well what do you think?
Patricia stepped between them, hoping to change the mood.
-All that was a long time ago. At least those horrible things couldn´t happen today. People would get to know, and they wouldn´t stand for it.
Albert replied in spite of himself.
-Like in Ethiopia in eighty four you mean? What do you think people knew? It wasn’t just a crop failure. There were people starving in camps practically next door to depots that were full of food, and then the government decided to move nearly half a million starving people out of the region. They died in their tens of thousands on the road.
 -There’s inefficiency and corruption everywhere, Patricia replied.
-It wasn’t incompetence Pat, it was a war, and starvation was a weapon. The government wanted to empty the land so that there would be nowhere for the rebels to hide. 
Patricia looked as if she was not sure he was being serious.
-If that were true then it would the most shocking crime. 
Albert shrugged. 
-It´s the same in every place. How were you taught that the First World War ended? Did you think the Germans in the trenches ran out of bullets?  Germany was blockaded by the English navy and the people starved. The blockade went on for a long time even after the surrender. Imagine starving to death when the war was already over. Food as a weapon is nothing new. 
Matthew responded angrily. It was an anger that he did not understand even as he expressed it; made worse by Albert seeming to have answers for everybody´s questions. 
-I suppose it is the English who were the real war criminals again. But still, you were happy enough that your family had British passports and you could come here when the trouble started in Uganda.
Patricia looked at him, genuinely shocked.
-Matthew, I hope you are going to apologize for that later. That’s too much.
Albert remained calm.
-I wasn´t talking about my personal story, Matt. I´ve been lucky I know and I have a lot to feel grateful for. I don´t think that makes bad things that happened in the past alright; still less bad things that might happen in the future. But if you´re saying that a British passport makes me not quite British, or second class British, and I should keep my mouth shut, then I´m sorry.
Matthew was silent with shame. The emotion that had made him speak so aggressively had vanished as quickly as it came. It was a mystery to him. His head was spinning with anguish and self disgust and alcohol. He needed another drink quickly. What had he felt the urge to shout at Albert? It had been something about demanding that he take life personally for a change and show that he actually cared about something instead of only knowing about everything.
But really that´s me, isn´t it? And it´s worse because I´m supposed to be the journalist and the one who tells people what is happening and makes them feel compelled to act. Journalist: don´t make me laugh.
Matthew stood in the garden for a while, holding a glass of whisky that he never tasted and letting the quiet darkness insulate him from the muffled sounds of voices from inside the house. By the time he´d recovered himself and gone back to apologize to Albert, his friend was back to his charming self and refused to accept that any offence had been given.
There were other thoughts that he wanted to share with Albert, when they could talk without everything needing to be polite. Shock was no substitute for compassion, he wanted to say. People were always hungry for novelty but they could resign themselves to any kind of cruelty if it was distant enough. He thought he had the words now but it was too late, the conversation had moved on. 
Albert told him that he would be leaving for a while in the next few days. He had some unspecified business to attend to but he expected to be back soon. In the end there were no hard words between them, but it was a bad way to part with someone Matthew would never in his life see again. 

Chapter Eight

It seemed as if 1992 was going to be a much better year for them all. Matthew was almost happy, because there would be an election and he was as certain as everyone else that the conservative government could not win; discredited by personal scandals and backbiting; clinging on amid the ruins of its economic policy. The next prime minister would be Neil Kinnock, and even if he wouldn’t be perfect, at least it meant that the country could start to recover from the ravages of Thatcherism. You almost felt sorry for his opponent, John Major. After her own party had stabbed Thatcher in the back, Major was the only one left who was senior enough and not steeped in the blood-letting, so he took nominal control. He’d be a forgotten man by the end of the year. 
David warned Matthew not to hope for too much in the way of a new age, but even he could hardly have believed that the government would hold on to power. He only said that the world had moved on in thirteen years of Tory rule. Some of the industries and institutions that Matthew wanted to see revived didn’t exist anymore, and people had changed their view of what was normal. David didn’t press the issue. Matthew knew much more about current affairs than he did: that was his job; and in any case he always thought that Matthew was cleverer than him. It was just that when it came to making predictions, in print or in private, he always seemed to be wrong. 
So far as David was concerned, he didn’t expect much from politicians, but he was pleased that the business seemed to have passed through the crisis and now at last they were making reasonable profits. He didn’t say much to Matthew about it, but desert wars were heavy on tank treads and the conflict in the Middle East had been good for Cromwell.  
And he’d been right about the housing crash. The same people who’d called him crazy to walk out on legal practice now spoke about him as a young man who knew a thing or two. In the local papers, he could do no wrong. He was the man who had saved jobs and turned a dying business around. Still, he thought, it wouldn’t have hurt Matthew to have given him a positive article about Cromwell occasionally.
It seemed that only Patricia didn’t share the general mood of optimism. She was making a name for herself at the bar, she had plenty of other interests to occupy her time, and so far as David could see they were very both happy. It was Matthew in his role as confidante who got to see another side of her mood. 
Matthew met Patricia at the law courts. It was easier for him to plan his arrival for their regular lunchtime meeting that for Patricia to know when she would be finished. When the weather was decent, he preferred to wait outside, in the pedestrian zone by the main entrance. The back doors were only for prison vans depositing remand prisoners for hearings, or collecting them afterwards, like so many empty milk bottles.
The court building made Matthew uneasy, although to Patricia the place was like home. He didn’t fit with the harsh women, large or skinny and their too many children come to see if dad was coming home, or with the nervous tattooed men with haunted expressions always looking for somewhere to smoke; and he could never be mistaken for a lawyer. He belonged to a class of outsiders; respectable looking individuals who were probably there to stand as witnesses and seemed lost: ignored by all, including the superannuated court ushers, flapping around busily with their black gowns and their official clip boards of cases.
When Patricia appeared, they went out of the building and round the corner to the old Victoria pub. Matthew asked Patricia what she felt like eating. She wasn’t hungry, so it would be only a liquid lunch for them. He asked if she’d been busy. 
-Nothing important. Only a couple of hopeless bail applications.
-I thought you were beyond that sort of thing.
-Rodney wants to keep the clients happy. Two of his regulars: petty criminals but they keep coming back – bread and butter stuff.
-And did they get bail?
-Raj and Pete? Not likely. They’d have collapsed with shock if we’d won. Likely to commit further offences while on bail, they say. Not likely so much as certain. When the trial comes up they know they are looking at a six months stretch, so for them freedom is a chance to work hard and put something away with no extra risk. But there old lags; they know the score. They came down for a day out and to collect cigarettes from Rodney’s clerk.
-It surprises me sometimes that you keep at this. You know; crime. Don’t you get fed up of them all?
-No I don’t. I can see how you might think I should be something important, like a tax barrister for example, but Raj and Pete are no worse than other clients I might have, and it matters that someone speaks for them. I remember being warned off crime: it’s not first rate work you know. The first time in my life I turned away from whatever was hardest and had most prestige, but I never regretted it.
Matthew smiled.
-You tell me that David has no doubts about life, and I have nothing but doubt. But Pat, you’re life is all about struggle. If life isn’t already a struggle, you’ll make it one. It’s as if good fortune was a curse and you have to spend your time trying to prove yourself worthy of it.
Patricia considered telling him about the sense of failure that still haunted her from that old Obuswu case. She wasn’t sure why is should be relevant, though it seemed to be. That memory represented something that she had not explained even to herself, so instead she only shrugged.
-If you’d been a Victorian lady, Matthew continued, you’d have spent your time doing good works and caring for the poor.
-Maybe, but we’ve progressed. We know that the underprivileged deserve rights not handouts; and that charity demeans the giver as well as the receiver, when it’s not about getting a tax break.
-If you say so. Is that why you prefer crime?
-It suits me to be a trial lawyer. There’s a verdict at the end. You have winners and losers. You know how I hate compromise, and I like to win.
Matthew thought about what she’d said. It sounded like a good answer, but it wasn’t the full story. But then, what business was it of his? She was only a friend after all and she didn’t even like him much. Probably he shouldn’t even be seeing her like this, though it was an arrangement they’d both become comfortable with. He saw a woman who sometimes had what looked like desperation in her eyes. She’d become tough, but there was a brittle quality to the hardness, and something that she needed (not him, he knew) but couldn’t find or even talk about.
-Are you sure you’re not hungry? he asked her.

***

As the year progressed, the next stage of David’s plans was revealed.
The Examiner exclusively reported that Cromwell Engineering was gearing up for an early public listing of its shares on the London Stock Exchange. The still youthful entrepreneur who had nurtured the success of the company, David Thomas, was quoted on his intention to have less day to day control over the business, giving space to the professional management team that he had brought in. It was announced that there would be a new Chairman of the board, Peter Douglas, who was well known to the City and would help to guide the flotation of the business on the stock exchange. 
Matthew had to ask him privately about that. 
-What’s this crap about you taking a back seat in future? Off the record.
-Apparently it’s what the City likes to hear. The chaps don’t believe that people like me, who only make businesses and understand what they do, speak their language. They prefer their own sort to be in charge; men who understand the importance of getting rich quick and don´t get too sentimental about the companies they run.
-And will you really step down?
-We’ll see about that. But we do need the money to grow. It´s too expensive to borrow from the banks.
-What about Peter?
-Peter will do what I tell him, that’s what I pay him for.
The flotation of the company went well, despite the uncertain times. Money was starting to flow again and there was a lot of nonsense in the media about the emergence of citizen shareholders. It seemed that now everyone wanted to be an investor. More importantly, the City of London had been freed of regulation and could do a lot more dealing with other people’s money. It was money that was hungry for investments. David went to market with a little over half the total shareholding. It felt like losing control but the advisers pointed out that he would still outvote other investors, and warned him that he couldn´t put less than that on offer if he was serious about listing. 
The demands of the process took over; for the next few months he was sucked into a whirlpool of meetings and presentations about what he had achieved and all that he hoped to do. It was easy to forget why they had even started it all off. But when it was all done, he found that the company had been valued more highly than their best expectations. Suddenly, and unexpectedly, he discovered that he was rich.
Matthew tried to be happy for him, though he was still depressed and trying to get over another Conservative election victory that meant more years in the wilderness for the people’s party. But he noticed that David himself seemed a lot less pleased than he should be. He’d achieved all that he’d set out to do. He’d saved the company and made it prosperous and now he was going to take a less active interest in day to day management and concentrate on strategy. But somehow David could not be content, or even satisfied, with his lot. Within a few months of the flotation, his mood had become morose and short tempered. For the first time, he even appeared to have some pessimism about life in general, as if he’d found a bitterness that he had not tasted before. 
The new chief executive, Andrew Foster, was the City’s man. David couldn’t argue that he and his team hadn’t increased the profits sharply in a few months, but he couldn’t make himself warm to the man either. The advisers had told him that Foster was widely respected and his appointment would be good for the share price. From the brief conversations David had with him, it was clear that Foster had little knowledge of engineering, and less interest in it. Not for the first time since he had brought in the merchant bankers, David had the sensation of having called into play forces that were beyond his control. It was all a new game and he was feeling his way with the rules, or perhaps it was that he was only a minor piece in the game, moved by the unseen hands of others. 
Andrew Foster was a small man with prematurely wispy hair and apparently boundless energy. His own people seemed absolutely dedicated to him, and David supposed that was good. He only wished that Foster had not needed to employ quite so many of them, and it troubled him that most of them seemed to be accountants spending their days compiling long reports that in David’s view added little to what he already knew about the business.
You knew that things had to change, he told himself, and it´s true that now everything is on a bigger scale. He had to remind himself that underneath there was still the creature that he had found half-dead and brought back to life. 
He fought against giving way to small minded resentment, but it was difficult for him to understand what Foster was trying to achieve. There were new people every day: sales people, marketing people, accountants, but when he toured the shop floor David didn’t see any new equipment or any new engineers. All the various kinds of managers seemed to be people who had worked with Foster before at other companies. David made an effort to be patient, but patience came even harder to him than letting someone else run the show. In advance of the first annual meeting of the company, he felt that he had to confront Foster with his doubts.
David´s old office had been in a shed like construction at one end of the plant, with windows that looked out over the shop floor. In the short time since he arrived, Foster had removed some of the older machinery and dedicated a large section of the plant to accommodation for the growing numbers of office staff. It was an area that was effectively sealed off from the works, where you had no sense of being in a factory that made things. David had gone along with the idea that it was reasonable to give the clerical types the kind of environment they were used to; though already Foster was making noises about the space being too cramped and needing some sort of corporate headquarters separate from the plant.
Foster´s own office was spacious enough: in fact the furnishings were positively luxurious. It was the office of a powerful man, confident in his grip on the business he managed. But when David tried to explain his doubts, Foster seemed confused.
-I’m not sure I understand what you’re saying David. My job is to make you and the other shareholders richer. We have beaten our forecast for every quarter since I started. You know where the share price is right now. All the movement has been in one direction. I know it’s hard for you to let go of the reins, but I don’t know what else you can ask of me.
 -When I floated the company, one of the main reasons was that we couldn’t afford investment to compete with plant that is being developed overseas.
-Of course, we mentioned that as a risk in the prospectus. Everyone knows about it. I remember you telling me about your visits to factories in Asia and the new machinery they have there, but this business has always been a high skill, low volume operation. Our investors know that.
David felt his point was being missed.
-It’s true we’ve got skilled workers here, and that’s what I wanted to save. It was the reason I bought this place. We’ve got people hand machining parts to tolerances that some of our competition wouldn’t even be able to measure. But look at the men: they’re not young. So far we’ve been able to grow by taking on guys from the same generation as our existing people; only because so many other works have been shutting down. I’ve tried to set on apprentices, but it takes time when you can find them and the lads don’t seem to have even basic knowledge. There are no new skilled men coming through.  And it’s more than that. Those factories I visited, they can do everything that we can, but with machines: their skill is in setting the machinery up. Once they have done that – cheap and reliable production and volume not an issue. 
-I don’t really see where you are going with this.
-It’s the machinery we need, and the new skills to use it. The idea was that after we went public we’d have the cash to make investment in the plant. Most of the equipment we need is designed in this country anyway. Once we’ve done that we can compete in the long term. But we’re losing time. So far, all you’ve done is increase the profits, pay a bigger dividend, and push the share price up.
-You make it sound as if that was easy. Our business plan committed us to some challenging targets as you know, and we’ve hit and bettered all of them. You know the cost of what you are suggesting? – We might even need a new factory to do it properly. What do you think would be the reaction of your investors, you for that matter, if I said; no profits for the next three years, we need to transform the business? Trust us; it will come out right in the long run. No one would give us a few years: you know it.
-Why not? We’d increase the real value of the company and its shares many times over by doing that. I didn’t bring this company to market for it to be a cash cow that you can milk to death.
-Of course not. And you wouldn’t need me and my team if that was the extent of your ambition. But you have to understand, corporate strategy is a little more complex than buying new tools for the engine shed.
-What is the strategy then - the real one I mean, not what we put in the glossy handouts and spin to your friends in the City?
Now Foster was on more comfortable ground. There was a gleam of true enthusiasm in his eye and his speech grew more fluid.
-First; we have a good war chest. The float went well and our equity funding is strong. We’ve been looking at acquisition targets and we have some very interesting possibilities.
-An acquisition makes you look good as a chief executive, but I don’t see how it helps our fundamental difficulty.
-Modern business is international David. You need to think more globally. Buying an overseas company will give us access to new markets. That makes us bigger and gives us economies of scale. 
-So we need to get bigger before we invest in being able to do the job properly?
-Capabilities are international as well. You’ve said it yourself: the capabilities in the Far East are ahead of what we have here. Production is more reliable and cheaper. There’s no reason why Cromwell should not benefit from a capability that already exists.
-If you’re suggesting that we might move production overseas, I’m telling you no. I won’t oppose you if you want to make a small acquisition; you know more about that than I do; but you won’t have my agreement to moving the work offshore, ever. 
-I can see that it’s something you are passionate about. It’s good that we should understand each other´s values and objectives and it’s useful for me to share your insights. We should talk again about this. 
The conversation with Foster left David feeling more uncomfortable than ever. He had to fight back anger when Foster suggested they put dates in their respective diaries to continue the discussion; as if they were making polite theoretical conversation that had nothing to do with the day to day running of the business. But what could he say? In the old days he would not have left the room without resolving an important business issue, but now it seemed that every decision required a period of reflection and discussion.
In the months that followed, David found himself becoming more and more remote from the business. He felt defeated without knowing why. It was as though he had slipped backwards, to the days when he worked for the partners and had no say. He had lost control of his own business and all he had to show for it was money. 
Long term inactivity and depression were not in his nature. He began to make plans to at least put the money in the service of something useful, but the time he could not avoid spending at Cromwell left him bored and exasperated in equal measure. It was a chore that he only wanted to be done with as quickly as possible. When Foster brought the Board a proposal to take over a U.S. competitor, his protests were muted. He told the Board that in his view the plan was too ambitious for a company of their size. 
-Our gearing will be frightening afterwards. They are bigger than we are now. If interest rates rise, we’ll be horribly exposed. Plus, Andrew tells me that their order book is full, but I have visited their main site as you gentlemen requested, and I have to tell you that if our plant is not state of the art, theirs is a decaying ruin in comparison.
-The fixed assets are weak, Foster conceded, but fully depreciated. Fortunately the US military supports US business, so as David said the contracts are solid.
-I didn’t say they were solid. I skimmed through some of the main contracts: they didn’t seem all that firm to me
-But as David himself has also told you gentlemen, he has not practised law for years and he’s not a specialist in this field. And as you would expect, our due diligence includes a full review from expert lawyers which concludes that everything is as they would expect to find it.
-That doesn’t really help us Andrew, unless you can explain what they expected to find and whether it’s worth anything?
-It’s just the way they put these things in the US, David. There is really nothing to worry about gentlemen.  We’ll be as careful as we can be. We’ve seen enough for me to assure you that anything else our diligence work turns up will only be the sort of issue that can be dealt with by a reduction in the price. Of course we’ll look hard to find as many of those issues as we possibly can.
Foster’s conspiratorial smile reassured them that they were all men of the world and that Andrew Foster knew his way around it better than most. Probably he would find ways to get the best of the naïve Americans over the details. The deal went through quickly, and before long more of Foster’s former associates were recruited to supervise a process that he called integration. 
Within eighteen months of the acquisition, the company’s situation had deteriorated dramatically. Things went from bad to worse in ways that even David wasn’t fully sure he understood. Most frustrating was that he had no authority to do anything about it. Matters came to a head late one Friday evening, when he and the chairman were summoned to an urgent meeting by Andrew Foster. 
David arrived with Peter Douglas at the appointed hour, feeling like an intruder in his own boardroom. Foster was already there, with a stranger. Too young, too neat and looks too smart, thought David; I don’t trust that one any more than I trust Andrew. After the greetings, Foster insisted on opening the proceedings in a very formal way. Taking refuge behind process, David thought. Trying to depersonalize the situation; planning something nasty obviously. 
-Thank you for attending at short notice gentlemen. Present, David Thomas, founder, Peter Douglas, chairman, myself Andrew Foster, chief executive, and this is Grant. He’s a lawyer.
-Where’s the company lawyer?
Foster slowly poured himself a glass of water from one of the bottles set out on the table before replying. 
-It’s not that kind of meeting David. We’ll dispense with the rest of the formalities. Right, first and only item of business, what are we going to tell the banks on Monday morning?
-About what Andrew?
-About the performance of the company Peter. I know the two of you don’t like to trouble yourselves with the finer points of company law, so let me put it simply. The half year results have to be announced next week. Remember I explained to the Board that they would be delayed and they agreed that you two should have delegated authority to approve them with me. Well, the results are not good: worse than we expected in fact. I have been advised that we are obliged to issue a profit warning, but it is also clear to me that if we do that in the current fragile state of our finances, the share price will crash.
-But we’re doing well. Very well. The factory’s never been busier, and the order books are full…
David interrupted the Chairman.
-It’s the US acquisition Peter
-Correct David, the problem is the US. It’s burned a lot of cash. The contracts that they had when we purchased turned out to be more like letters of intent. No minimum orders, no guarantees, no exclusivity, and as it turns out, no business as yet, though we are still optimistic in the medium term. We’ve stood down half the work force there, but of course there’s a lot of fixed cost that we can’t do anything about. And then there’s the matter of the debt to service.
-I told you all that company was a dud
-You did that David and your opinion was duly minuted; but you are a member of the Board and the Board heard my presentation and voted unanimously to go ahead with the deal. 
-Forty million of debt.
-Yes, forty million.
-And the bank covenants?
-Not looking good David, not looking good at all
-To say that the U.S. purchase was your deal, and it looks like bringing down the company, I have to say you seem quite cheerful Andrew.
Foster had the nerve to smile at him.
-But inside I’m wounded. Here’s what though. One door closes and another one opens. Grant. Explain
The young man unloaded a thick sheaf of presentation folders from his briefcase.
-My client is a private investment fund, which shall remain nameless for the moment. You may know the sort of company I mean. We are sometimes referred to as venture capitalists.
-Vulture capitalists you mean.
-As you like Mr Thomas. In any case my client has been taking an active interest in your company for some time. You know that the shares have not been very liquid since you floated the company, given that Mr Thomas has held on to around forty percent of them
-Forty seven percent, David corrected him.
-Quite, but it is the fundamentals of the company that have interested my client. I can say that we have followed your progress, to the extent of foreseeing the imminent cash flow difficulty in which you find yourselves
-It sounds like you’ve been doing a little more than reading our press releases. Did you have a friend on the inside by any chance?
-We have some very talented and thorough corporate analysts in our company Mr Thomas.
-I’m sure you do.
-The point is Mr Thomas; we believe that there is a way through your current problems that could be for the benefit of all concerned. We are in a position to make an offer to buy the full shareholding of the company and to de-list it from the stock exchange. That offer would of course include the purchase of your own remaining shares.
 -This is my company, why would I want to sell?
-It’s actually a public company Mr Thomas; you already did sell when you listed the company on the stock exchange. I think you did quite well out of the deal. Now you are only the principal shareholder and an officer of the Board of Directors, the same as your colleagues here. As a matter of law, and in common with other Board members, you have duties to the company Mr Thomas; as does Mr Foster being the Chief Executive and Mr Douglas here. You should think very carefully before rejecting a generous bid, when it seems that there may be no viable alternative for the company.
-I’ll go to the banks. They know me well enough.
Foster shook his head. David imagined that he chuckled.
-I’ve already spoken to the banks David, informally of course. They want this deal to happen.
-You’ve done what Andrew?
-Time is short.
-You’ve planned all this carefully in advance haven’t you? You bought the US business to get us into debt. The deal never made any commercial sense. Tell me who is going to be the CEO of this new de-listed company. Surprise me.
Grant answered the question.
-Mr Foster has agreed to stay on as CEO for the time being to ensure there will be a period of stability. Everyone will want to see that, in the interests of the company.
-And with a better package and more share options for him, I suppose. 
-I can only say here that the CEO will be offered a remuneration package, including equity participation, consistent with the need of the company to retain its top talent, at this difficult time.
-Thanks Greg, and what have you decided you are prepared to pay me for my stake in the business, at this difficult time?
-It’s Grant actually. I have the calculations here before me Mr Thomas. You are free to look at them here, though for obvious reasons I cannot authorise you to take any copies away from this room at present. You will see there are three alternative bases of calculation set out and that we have taken into account various possible future scenarios for the business. 
-That’s not what I asked but thank you. How much per share?
-Forty nine pence
They’re worth two pounds sixty you bastards.
Foster shrugged his shoulders.
-They were priced at two pounds sixty at close of business today David. Next week you have an announcement to make, and by the end of that day, I guess that forty nine pence will look more than generous. However, by next week it would be too late.
Peter had remained silent, his face becoming more flushed. Now at last he spoke.
-We’ll need to think about it. You can’t expect us to make a decision just like that.
David shrugged.
-I think that’s exactly what they expect of us Peter. 
-It’s just stealing, nothing better. Andrew, you’re behaving like a crook. There’s no difference between you and a common criminal. 
-Actually there is a big difference Peter; In the first place I haven’t broken any laws, and second, when you look at the numbers involved here, there is nothing common about it. You shouldn’t look so glum boys. You will still be very well off at forty nine pence, and no need for you to worry about the company any more. David, you made a fortune already when you floated. Now it’s someone else’s turn. That’s the way of things. Nothing personal gentlemen, you’ve both been very agreeable to work with. It’s just the way the wheel turns
-What are you talking about?
-Natural selection. Business. What can be broken must be broken. You know, there are two types of company boss nowadays. The old sort, like you David, they start the company off; probably know something about how the business works, but not about much else. The other sort is more like me. We come after. We’re not so much interested in the business for its own sake, but we know how to make money from it; mostly for ourselves perhaps, but you see, others like ourselves benefit. That’s why the City loves my kind of boss, because around us, there’s always going to be some action that gives smart people a chance to make a lot of money quickly. I’m the sort of boss who comes highly recommended. We are the future. And once you have invited us over the threshold, there is no way back. 
-This is against the rules, Peter shouted. He was now red with indignation.
-Really Peter? And how am I breaking the rules, you tell me? Because as far as I can see, I am having this chat with you, and that means that any rules I am breaking you are breaking too.
David stood up.
-Alright, I’ve heard enough, you can both leave now. 
-We need your decision David.
-You’ll have it on Sunday night, not before. Give me your contact details. 
-We can’t do this kind of deal overnight.
-I’m sure you have it organized so that you could do it in an hour.
-We have to have your decision now
-Well, you can’t have it. You’ll make them wait Andrew, because just now, if there’s no decision, you have something to lose as well as me. And I’ll be taking these calculations with me, for what they’re worth. You’ll have to trust me that they will stay confidential.
Grant sprang up. 
-I don’t have instructions that would allow me to release those papers to you. 
-Tough shit Greg. Do me a favour now and piss off. I need to talk to my Chairman.
Five minutes later the two men were alone; Peter sitting slumped with his head in his hands, and David standing, pacing the room.
-Thank god they’ve gone at least, he said. We’ll have to get this room steam cleaned next week to get rid of the slime.
-I’ve let you down David, I’m so sorry.
-You have let me down Peter, but there’s no point dwelling on it. Go home and leave me to think
-What will you do?
-Have my head examined for trusting that little shit Foster. Then I’m going to make a few calls and see if I can find anyone who has spare cash lying around and might want to help us. Fifty million should do it wouldn’t you say?

***

That same evening, Matthew’s phone rang. He picked up the call.
-Get your passport handy Matt, we have a flight to catch to Zurich
-When? 
-Early tomorrow. And don’t forget it’s a cold city. Dress warm.
Matthew started to protest that it was not so easy for him to drop everything and run just because David said so. David asked him what he had to do that was so important. He did not sound in a mood to be argued with: he only added that it was about the business and that he would explain later. Matthew pleaded that whatever David’s difficulties might be, he would be the last person to be able to help. David replied that he did not need anyone to tell him what to do; only someone he could trust to be with him. 
The taxi with David already in it picked him up before it was light. It was a strange flight; David barely spoke. The brief day was already fading when reached a high rise hotel in the centre of the freezing city. Finally David explained what he had meant about trust.
-I have to meet some people this evening. There’s no need for you to come. I just need you to stay here. Best you don’t leave the hotel in fact. Keep this case safe, and don’t hand it over to anyone but me. 
He presented Matthew with a small, but heavy, black document case.
-If I’m not back by, say one thirty tonight, then you open it, but not before, got it?
-And then what?
-You’ll know once you open the case.
Matthew snorted.
-I’m sorry, but all of this just seems a little mysterious and, well, unnecessary. Anyone would think we were in Chicago in the thirties. This is Switzerland you know: bankers and cuckoo clocks.
-I’ve been here before, yes. 
David motioned him to the window. Darkness had fallen quickly. Far below them, the city was a huddle of indistinct black shapes. Harsh neon pools of light illuminated the sides of buildings. Snaking lines of soft amber headlights and harsher red tail lights marked the comings and goings of the traffic.
-Down there.
David pointed. Matthew noticed a space where the streetlights illumined a wooded area, with neat pathways running through it; park land obviously. He could pick out tiny human figures wandering around or slumped on the benches.
-Unusual for so many people to be in the park, when it’s so late and so cold, he commented.
-They’re out there every night; some live there. That’s the needle park – only for people buying selling and using drugs: here in the centre of this neat and prosperous city of bankers.
-You couldn’t stay out there all night. You’d freeze to death
-Some of them do. Others overdose. The city is very efficient about removing the bodies. This is a neat town; even the park. But still, probably not somewhere you want to go for a stroll at this time. I’ve passed through it in daylight. The solid citizens walk by if it’s on their way and don´t seem to notice anything unusual happening. 
-What’s your point?
-The park tells you something about the city and its people. The kind of place it is. If you have business here you are more or less free to get on with it, even if it should consist of killing yourself, slowly or quickly. It’s not the kind of city where passers-by involve themselves, unless there’s a percentage in it. I suppose I’m saying that it’s the kind of place where a certain kind of businessman, might feel at home
-Now you have me worried
-Well, don’t be. I’ll call you if I’m going to be any later than expected. Otherwise, the arrangements are as I said.
-I think I can manage that.
Matthew spent an anxious evening drinking hotel beer in his room. He never did look in the case. He didn’t even check if it was locked. He was not so certain that he wanted to have any knowledge of what might be inside. In any case, David was back at the hotel not long after midnight. He seemed relieved, though he didn’t say much. Matthew had to assume that everything had been sorted out. 
In the week that followed, Cromwell Industries announced moderately encouraging results, and the unscheduled departure of its Chief Executive Andrew Foster, who the board thanked for his brief but significant contribution to the development of the business. David didn’t have much to say about the split, or how it might be connected to Zurich. He was kept busy as acting chief executive of Cromwell, but that seemed to make him his energetic and positive self again.

Chapter Nine

It was a typical wet Monday morning in a northern town. The roads were too crowded and the fine rain hung in the grey air making everything seem dirtier than it already was. Just outside the centre, on the south side, a cluster of mixed use commercial buildings crowded like neglected shrubs in the untended deltas between highways and interchanges. The tenants lived a hand to mouth existence, hoping to make enough each month to cover rent and outgoings. There was always a new To Let board appearing somewhere on the estate as another business succumbed.
Mitchell Walcott arrived late to work, confident that nothing interesting or important would be waiting for him. Ignoring the post trays, he slouched straight to the cupboard that served as his private office and let his soft body sink into the heavily cushioned chair. He felt exhausted as if he had done a week’s work already.
His assistant, and sole employee, brought him tea. He watched intently as Susan put the mug down and left the office, noting a small awakening of lust. She knows I’m watching her, he thought, even if she’s not sure that she welcomes the attention.
Mitchell gnawed at a biscuit while reflecting on that. Pretty girl; should be out of his league, but with two young kids and the man gone, who could say? Probably lonely; probably could do with some help with the kids. Children though. The thought made him shudder.
She brought the post in, and some telephone messages, none of which amounted to much. Time to speak to Derek. Unusually his partner was actually present in the office that morning.
-What do you have for us today, Derek? 
Nothing real, as usual. Just the appearance of being very busy. Derek was a big man, fat in fact. Bustling around his own tiny office, hands never still, threatening to spill the many papers that were stacked around the room. But it was always the same papers that had been lying there for months. Derek muttered something about having a lead on a big consumer debt, needing to follow up on a trace. Mitchell ignored that.
-We have a stack of bills that we need to talk about. Here are some of them. Look.
-And we will, but just now I have to follow up on this (putting on his coat). There is a good chance I can find us this Hawkins guy before the end of the week.
-Bear in mind you probably won’t find him in the bar at the Old Fox.
Derek nodded gravely, as if this was information worthy of proper consideration, and then he was gone. Mitchell returned the overdue invoices to Derek’s in tray, feeling that he may just as well put them in the waste basket. 
That was Monday´s business. 
On Tuesday, Mitchell had nothing at all to do. He received three phone calls from a firm of enquiry agents, whose invoices were gathering dust in Derek’s tray, and another call from his wife, which was about picking up his wonderful children. Derek made an appearance late in the afternoon. Mitchell followed him into his office to cut off the avenue of escape. He insisted that Derek should listen and that they should confront the financial realities of their situation. Derek listened to what he had to say for a while, with a show of great attention. Finally he interrupted to say that he had not understood anything of what Mitchell was saying
-That’s why you and I make a good team Mitch. You have the accounting knowledge to deal with all this. My expertise is in the field. I’ve got every confidence in you. But you know that everything you say about numbers is Greek to me.
Then of course he had to leave to follow up an urgent lead in the Hawkins case.
Mitchell returned to his office and opened the dreaded ledgers on his personal computer. The firm was not so much sinking rapidly as sitting on the bottom, drowning slowly. Not for the first time, he reflected that Derek had invited him to join the business less for his bookkeeping skills than for the money he´d paid to buy into the business; money that Mitchell had raised on the security of his house.  Taking on a debt that now he couldn´t afford to service. The cash was gone and there was nothing to show. So much for business projections. Better to have stayed an anonymous number cruncher at the old firm than this. He could say he was his own boss; probably for another month or two at most. And after that bankruptcy, most likely.  He opened the office door.
-Sue, do you fancy a quick drink after work again tonight? This place is getting to me?
-Why not? My mum has the kids tonight. Are you ok to be late home?
-Not my night to collect the brats. If Mrs W rings, tell her I will be working a little late
Not that she’d notice or care, he thought. Probably, on balance, she would prefer that I should be late, as in, the late Mitchell Walcott. He thought about his solid, unremarkable wife and the two teenage children. At that moment he couldn´t imagine a single reason why he would ever in his life want to go home again. 
Then he thought back to his own childhood, trying to picture some moment of domestic tenderness, that would shine out past the years of boredom and resentment that he remembered all too well. There must have been some moments when he´d been happy at home, something to suggest that he wasn´t just wasting his time with his own kids. He couldn´t think of anything. It´s something lacking in me, he mused, I´m just not a complete person.
His thoughts returned to his wife. How to describe her? Words came readily to mind; middle-aged, aging, past her prime. But in fact they were the same age. That realization made his hands start to shake. I’m feeling panic, he marvelled. Maybe it was better to feel that than nothing at all.
On Wednesday it rained again, so naturally this was the day he had to leave the office. Derek had actually managed to trace a couple of debtors. Local small time stuff but business was business, as Derek reminded him. Mitchell asked why, if he was the back office man, it should be him who had to make the call. Derek was very apologetic, patiently explaining that he would have seen to it himself only that he was completely overwhelmed by the Hawkins case, which was making good progress, thanks to help from Derek’s old friends in the police force. It’s not what you know; it’s who you know, eh Mitch? 
Who was he kidding? Derek didn´t have any friends. And Mitchell knew that the police force had kicked him out, even though Derek didn´t know that he knew.
-This job is not such a big deal, but it will be a good opportunity for you to learn about the operational side. The address is rented and I don´t expect the debtors are working, but, you know, it´s a catalogue debt. All this cash they´ve spent, they must have some stuff lying around that they’d rather hold on to and I´ll bet they can raise some cash once you let them see that it would be better for them to see the back of you.
-But there are two of them. Two blokes in one house
-Are you worried that they might be dangerous, or that they might be gay?
-I’m worried that they might be dangerous gays.
-These two aren’t dangerous, except where there’s a window left open or a door unlocked. Believe me I know these two characters from way back.
Mitchell drove past the house twice and then parked a few streets away, where he felt the car was safer. He walked back to the address. Some of the houses were boarded. Number 27 was lived in, but run down. He didn´t really expect anyone to answer the doorbell ring, but Raj and Pete invited him in almost without explanation, as if they were so bored they were grateful for the chance to talk to anyone. 
In the house there was almost no furniture, only in the front room a giant TV screen, a games console, and some dirty cushions against the back wall.  Empty beer cans and pizza boxes littered the fireplace. 
-Want a beer? They asked: Mitchell declined on the basis he was driving and anyway did not usually drink before ten thirty in the morning. He asked them if they were in employment. 
-Nah, we’re burglars generally, Raj replied. 
-But looking to rehabilitate ourselves, added Pete. 
-That’s what my partner said, Mitchell told them, mentioning Derek’s name. 
-That man is a arsehole, said Raj. Mitchell nodded his agreement. 
-Believe me it in’t easy, said Raj. They don’t give you no help when you try to go straight. Sometimes you think you was better off when you was inside.
Mitchell considered this.
-But it looks as if you’ve been helping yourselves a little bit; with all these purchases from the catalogue. I´ve got the list here look. You’ve not exactly been doing without, looks like. That’s a lot of stuff and a tidy bit of money you owe. And so far you´ve paid back, let´s see; nothing. But I don’t see much of anything lying around here now.
-No man, we sold most of it straight away, said Pete.
-But you’re still supposed to pay for it.
-Yeah, right. With what?
-The way we look at it, Raj explained, these people was practically giving us free money. We didn’t even have to tell them no lies – well hardly. So if they are stupid enough to do that, right, then what we owe them is not our fault.
-Well now I’m here. You´ve been traced. I have to ask you to pay something to me on account and to make an agreement to clear the debt in a reasonable time
-Yeah, right
-We can sign an agreement if you like. 
-Yeah we can afford to give you a promise.
-I’m used to that, believe me, Mitchell sighed.
On balance it was not such a bad visit. At least the car was not damaged when he went back to it. 
Derek told him that burglars weren’t dangerous, just inadequate. They all did time inside because they kept getting caught. They were incompetent to begin with and then they had to be drunk or high to find the nerve to do the job. Even when they didn’t screw up completely, there was no money in burgling. You had to practically give away whatever you lifted. According to Derek, it was just a few people and the police could easily take every burglar in the country off the street in a week; except there would be no point because the lawyers and the court system would put them back on the street the week after. 
On Thursday night, Sue’s mother had the kids over for the night and Mitchell managed to talk himself into her into bed after they left the pub. At least that was the way he described it to himself. In reality, it felt more like Sue had decided that they may as well have sex as she was not doing anything else that evening. 
Afterwards, Mitchell worried more about his wife finding out than he would have expected. He felt there must be some telltale sign about his body that was invisible to himself but that a woman would spot instantly. If there was such a thing, his wife was not interested enough to notice it.
The truth was that he had found the experience pleasant enough, but unsatisfying. There had been no pursuit, no difficulties to overcome. And nothing had changed, not even Sue. On Friday, she spoke to him with exactly the same preoccupied voice that she always had; still went about her work looking bored by it all. They had agreed loosely that they would meet again in the following week but he was not sure it would happen. 
I’m just as invisible to her as I am to everyone else, he thought.
Late Friday morning, he gathered all the books together, determined to produce a consolidated analysis of the business that even Derek would understand. After an hour and a half he gave it up and retreated to the Old Fox, alone. I’m turning into Derek, he decided.

***

But it turned out that Derek was not so completely useless as he had supposed. On Sunday morning he phoned Mitchell at home, sounding genuinely excited and claiming that he had finally tracked down Ray Hawkins. The account was delinquent in a big way. Hawkins owed the bank the thick end of a hundred and twenty thousand. Took the loan as cash and vanished. It´s a diamond trace, Derek crowed. 
The catch was that the address was a hotel where Hawkins would be staying in London; but no-one knew how long he would be there. All they had to do to get paid was verify it really was him and report back. No need to speak to him at all, only it had to be done quickly. And he was certain to be there Monday evening. Derek would go himself, was desperate to go, but absolutely could not on that night, for reasons he could not go into. 
Mitchell didn’t press him. He was so bored he would have volunteered to take Derek’s place. Something happening at last. 
Mitchell spent most of Sunday in his study. Actually it was only a spare room that was just big enough for a desk where he could shut the door on the family and claim to be working. Mitchell didn’t read much: reading was one of the many things he had given up on. In his study, he preferred to look at old maps and travel guides, planning journeys he knew that he would never make: journeys he´d never known he wanted to make in the years when there would have been nothing to stop him going. 
He couldn´t remember when he´d started to experience a longing for travel. He supposed it coincided with an awareness that he´d wasted half his life through lack of courage, or appetite, or maybe just desire. Over time the imaginary journeys became more vivid and detailed. The roots of fantasy took hold. The nature of his daydreams also changed. Now he was beyond the idea of a holiday trip to an exotic destination; nothing less that the idea of a new life stirred him, in a new place where no-one knew his name; where he could start again as a different person; someone better. The fantasy had become not so much about the places he would go to, as the person he would become. 

***
The reality of a trip is always different to the anticipation.
Ray Hawkins had been dining and drinking alone when he introduced himself to Mitchell. He was a big man, not tall but solid, with big rough hands that he waved about a lot. He rose from his own table and covered the space between the two of them with a speed that was startling, even though he looked perfectly at ease. He filled the space in front of Mitchell, beaming an easy grin that had something sharklike in it. 
Ray invited himself to sit at Mitchell´s table, tapping his empty pint glass for the waiter to see and commanding beer for both of them
-I might have to drive later, Mitchell protested.
-No one but a resident eats in a hotel restaurant like this. You must be staying here. Drink up. 
Ray questioned him about his business, noticed that he was from out of town (from up north, like me) and suggested that the two of them ought to stick together in the big, dangerous city. 
-It is a coincidence that you should choose to eat here, because when I saw you sliding into this little corner table here, it occurred to me that I’d spotted you earlier on today, on the street, twice in fact. Almost as if you were following me around.
He smiled pleasantly as the waiter arrived.
-Very good. Beer for both of us. Better than this fizzy water you´ve been sipping for half an hour. Charge them to my room please. 
-Thanks
-Now then, tell me. Who sent you after me?
Mitchell considered his options: looking at Ray, it did not seem a good idea to insist that his presence was only a coincidence. 
-The bank, he admitted weakly.
 Ray’s smile became broader.
-What I thought. That’s a relief then, nothing serious.
-You don’t call a hundred and twenty thousand serious?
-A hundred and twenty? It was only ninety when they gave it me. The rest is interest and charges piled on I suppose. Robbing bastards aren’t they?
-Can you pay?
-You should be asking me, will I pay.
The hotel restaurant had big, plate glass windows. Outside the streets were filling up; mostly young people out to enjoy themselves; on their way to theatres and bars. Inside, the room was too brightly lit; in fact everything about the place was too bright. The buzz of adventure that had been with Mitchell for most of that day, vanished in the second that he saw Ray get up and move towards him: instead he felt sickness in his stomach. The man looked more cheerful than his photograph, but somehow the cheerfulness was more threatening than a serious expression. 
Inwardly Mitchell was cursing Derek; his excuses, his evasiveness, his laziness, maybe his cowardice. But still Ray was smiling at him, insisting they share another drink.
-We’ve got some time to kill, he said. Let me tell you a little story.
The story had to do with Ray, in the days when he was a soldier of some kind in Northern Ireland, being followed by one of the “Micks” for reasons that he didn’t go into. The way Ray told the story; it had been a charming diversion for all concerned. From his tone, you´d think maybe the tale was going to end with a shaking of heads and a friendly handshake. Mitchell guessed that, in fact, it would not end like that at all. 
-And mind you, Ray continued, you ended up respecting the Micks. They were soldiers, they had a purpose. We had to shoot one or two of them in the head, after our little chats, but they didn’t whine even when they knew it was coming. They knew the score. And it got me to wondering why we were up against them, and what good were our lads doing there. 
-They planted bombs and blew up innocent people didn’t they?
-They did that, but they were at war. And hasn’t every army in every war in this century busied itself with blowing up innocent civilians on one side or another? But I see your point, yes. One thing to kill civilians by dropping bombs from the sky, but poor form to deliver them personally. In a perfect world bombs should only be dropped from aeroplanes. Keeps that random element that makes it easier on the conscience. If you can’t afford aeroplanes you shouldn’t be allowed to fight wars. 
Ray took a long pull on the beer.
-Where was I? Oh yes, the story. But I should say, as an aside, that after I’d been to Ireland a second time, I was more interested in why the British Empire was there at all. I mean there’s never been any oil anything precious in the ground in Ireland; no emeralds in the Emerald Isle. That’s a bad one, I admit. So far as I could find out, we Brits were only there in the first place because some of our rulers had stolen land from the locals to set up farms for themselves that they liked so much they weren´t prepared to let go. Of course it got more complicated later on, when the religion came into it. But the more I found out about it, the more I thought that if I’d been Irish myself… well you know.
-But anyway, to continue this tale; there I was, and there he was, and it seemed clear that he understood that I knew that he was following me. These situations get complicated, is my point. Ah, but here is our guest now, clever of you to choose a nice confidential table for our chat.
Ray stood up to greet a newcomer. Mitchell’s back was to the door, and he felt he should not turn without permission. 
-Don’t think of walking away just now, Ray whispered to him, one big hand on his shoulder as the other was extended in greeting to the stranger. 
The newcomer, who Ray greeted effusively, was a short, slightly built man, with an unusual appearance. He had very black, neatly combed hair, a long face with a small chin and sharp nose. His brown eyes seemed to glare at them both without blinking. His clothes were very neat, and not quite English, and Mitchell guessed that he was older than he looked. Although he was so much smaller than Ray, he did not seem at all intimidated by him. Ex military, Mitchell thought, like Ray, but officer class. 
Ray ordered wine and they sat down. Mitchell said nothing. He was astonished when Ray began to speak to the stranger in a foreign language, in which he appeared to be quite fluent. Mitchell guessed that the language was Spanish, but the exchanges were too rapid for him to make any sense of what was said, other than a few isolated words that sounded familiar. He gave up trying to make any sense of the conversation and made himself concentrate on watching the pair of them, only as a way to contain his rising sense of panic. Both of them had faces you would remember. At one point it became clear that he was being referred to in the conversation, but no comment seemed to be expected of him. 
Then the voices sounded quite heated and Mitchell strained to understand whether the men really were angry, or was it only the way that conversations sounded in this language. The stranger began to bang on the table to make his point, so it must have been anger, but even then they spoke in low voices. They seemed to calm down quickly enough, though it was plain from the body language that Ray was trying to placate his guest and that the man remained more than ready to take offence.
-Suddenly the stranger began to speak in English, addressing both of them.
-I want to tell you something about myself, he said. You remember, perhaps, in my country el teniente coronel Tejero, of the guardia civil?
Ray screwed up his small eyes in thought.
-I remember something about that name.
-He was the man in eighty one, who had the courage to storm the Cortes, and hold the deputies hostage. 
-Ah, yes. He went into the parliament with his troops, and held the ministers at gunpoint. I remember seeing pictures of it. An excited man with bulging eyes and a silly hat. He was calling on the king to get rid of the politicians. But the king didn’t want to know and it all fizzled out.
-He was trying to save the nation, the stranger insisted. From the communists and maricons. But the king … well one cannot blame the king. He was inexperienced and he had his advisers. He was…
-For the people, Ray suggested. 
-In any case he was not for the communists and queers, but now they are in charge anyway. 
He became more composed.
-I tell you this is because my uncle was there with the coronel. And maybe he was there at another time before, when the need of the country was great and he did not refuse to make the sacrifice that was called for. My uncle was a man who did not shirk his duty and nor do I. 
He paused for a moment.
-It is important for you to understand that we are serious men: men of honour who will do what needs to be done. England is an old tired country and here you believe in nothing, and that nothing will change. You imagine that things will go on in the same way forever. But Spain is an even older country, much older in many ways, and we know that this is not so. And because of this, my friend, you should not think of me as some deluded Quixote for whom you do not need to have a serious regard. I do not stand alone.
-I understand.
-Then we understand each other. Bueno.
The whole thing lasted about an hour. Nobody touched the wine. When the newcomer stood to leave everything seemed cordial. They shook hands again and Ray squeezed his shoulder with his free hand
-So, he said, nos entendemos, we will try again, and do our best, but we cannot promise anything, claro?
-Si, understood. Hasta luego, and with a short bow to each of them he was gone.
Curiosity got the better of Mitchell. Noting that he had been referred to in the conversation he supposed that he might have a right to know something of what it was about. Ray explained to him that this was not the case; and that in any event, the less he knew, the better it would be for him. Ray seemed to be in a good mood for some reason. 
-Now you and I will have a few more drinks to be sure Pedro has gone, he smiled. 
-Is Pedro his real name? 
-What do you think?
Neither of them spoke for a minute as Ray drained his glass and poured more wine for them both.
-Let’s just say, Ray confided, that Pedro wanted to buy something from me, but I’m not sure whether he really wanted to buy it, or only to know whether I had it to sell.
-What was he asking you for?
-Well you have an honest face, meaning that you look like you know nothing about anything, so it’s safe to talk to you. He said he wanted to buy supplies of something called titadine. It’s a product used in mining. It makes a loud bang.
-What’s so surprising about that?
-It’s just not the sort of thing policemen like Pedro go around buying.
Ray would not say any more on this subject, but he made sure that they stayed in the bar long enough for Mitchell to become hopelessly drunk. 
-About time for your bed now. I’m in a good mood tonight, almost a helpful mood. I think I’ll go on somewhere after this, but I might grant you three wishes first. 
-The hundred and twenty
-You don’t want to go spoiling my mood
-I need to go back with something.
-Really? I supposed your job would just be to find out where I was staying; check it was really me. Isn’t that how it goes? You don’t seem like a person anyone would send to collect money from me. 
-Well that’s true enough, but the way it works, now that we have spoken, I have to be able to say that I tried to collect some money on account from you; and to agree a payment schedule.
-Now you are becoming tiresome, Ray sighed. I need somewhere with a bit more life than this place. Come along if you want. No. Well in that case it has been very nice to meet you.
Ray made as if to rise but hesitated.
-Remember my story about the Irishman. I didn’t finish it.
-I’m not anxious to hear the ending.
Ray nodded. 
-So you are not totally stupid. It was useful for me tonight, that Pedro should think I have my associates with me. I’d rather him not know I was on my own. He’s more dangerous than you might guess. And then there’s myself, I can be dangerous too. So your best bet to be out of this situation and not even thinking about it in your own private thoughts. Am I clear? You put it out of your mind. Good.
He reached into his chest pocket and for a moment Mitchell felt the panic rising again. Ray pulled out a heavy battered wallet and began peeling bank notes from it. He put a pile of them on the beer soaked table in front of them. 
-That’s four grand there, he announced. You can give that to the thieving bastards at the bank, or – he paused reached into his trouser pocket and drew out another wad of notes – there’s another two grand making six in all. You can take both piles for having to explain that you failed to find any sign of me. 
Mitchell looked around, concerned at seeing so much money exposed in public before them. 
-It’s real money if that’s what’s worrying you, but it’s not a good idea to leave it on display.
Mitchell hesitated. Derek said that the golden rule was to take any cash on offer whatever supposed conditions were attached. Promise anything, deny later. He began to scoop up the cash. Ray watched for a moment smiling, but then he placed his big hand on top of Mitchell’s own. 
-Good lad. Right call. A word to the wise though, the smile was still there, friendly as ever. I don’t know what’s on your mind and I don’t know who put you up to this, though I can tell you they are not your friend. I’m guessing that whoever sent you here had a good reason for not coming himself, which might mean that he knows more about me than you do. This is not your normal line of work, and if I said you were taking to it like a duck to water, I’d be lying. Leave it at that. It’s not up to me to explain your own situation to you, but it is important that you should have it clear in your head that, in my world, when you pick up that money, it means you and I have a deal. And in that world you don’t go back on your deals. You might also want to keep it in mind that this is money I’m happy to lose. You could call it an acceptable cost of the evening ending without unpleasantness. Are we clear?
Mitchell nodded, pocketed the rest of the money, and walked back to his room. When he shut the door he noticed that his teeth were chattering, though it was warm enough. He sat on the bed for a while, getting up two or three times to check that the door was still locked. He wouldn’t have slept at all but the alcohol put him out. He woke up early the next morning, sitting in the armchair, fully clothed. He supposed that Ray must have left already, but he made no attempt to find out for sure. 

***

Wednesday morning: back in the office.
-How was it in London?
Like I’d tell you anything Derek.
-No show. Duff information as usual.
-Shame. I’ll get back on it.
Had he sounded natural enough? What to do with the cash now? Pay it into his own account? -  might as well hand it straight over to Mrs W. Do the decent thing and pay it into the business? - The business would be gone in a few weeks, and besides he’d already lied about it just now. Hide it somewhere, but where? - The safe of course: no one looked in there. There was never anything to look at in the safe. The drawback was that Derek knew where the key was. But under the old papers that were rotting away in there, it should be well enough hidden. Easy enough to get Derek out of the office, whilst he did the hiding: just ask to speak to him about the finances. 
The next morning, Sue brought him some tea and treated him to one of her smiles that were rather insipid when he thought about it.
-Sue, do you ever think about, I don’t know, just leaving all this behind and starting again somewhere new?
-Not really, do you? You don’t seem like the type.
What was he thinking of really? What could you do with six thousand? More than you could do with less than nothing was the inner reply. Nothing to lose was there? 
-Anything else I can do? He’d forgotten that Sue was still there.
-What?
-You look worried
-No, everything’s fine
-You’re not in any trouble over that money are you?
-What money?
-That envelope in the safe. I suppose you put it there yesterday. Derek was looking at it last night, after you’d gone. Counted it all but put it back. Not very like Derek, I thought.
-How did he find it?
-He didn’t say. Didn’t seem to know quite what he was looking for, but you could see he was looking for something, if that makes any sense. He was in your office for a while
Cheating, deceitful, lying bastard. He knew. He knew and he was obviously planning to take it all for himself. Probably planning to come in the evening after Mitchell had gone home. Cheat, cheat, but what to do about it? The answer was obvious; get there first. 
After a little thought, Mitchell went to visit Raj and Pete later that afternoon. It was a little difficult to persuade them to break into an office at short notice (“we do houses not offices, and we don’t do safes”). When he’d explained for the third or fourth time how easy it was to get in and where the safe key would be, they seemed a little more willing, and once he’d told them that the firm was intending to make an insurance claim after the burglary, then it made sense to them and they became almost enthusiastic. A dishonest motive made everything comprehensible.
-And don’t forget, he said, there’s five hundred in readies in that safe, just waiting for you. But it has to be tonight, when there’s no chance of anyone being there.
The rest of the money felt comfortable in an envelope in the breast pocket of his jacket.

***

Mitchell was awake when the phone rang at three fifteen in the morning. He took the call before anyone else in the house was disturbed, carrying the phone to his study as quietly as he could.
-You never told us there might be someone there. If you had told us that we would not have gone near the place. It’s your fault.
-What’s my fault? What are you talking about? Where have you been till now?
It was clear that Raj was quite drunk; he supposed Pete would be too. Raj admitted they’d had a few drinks to steady their nerves before the job. His story, so far as Mitchell could understand it, was that they’d gone to the office in the early hours of morning, and everything went according to plan at first. They found the key, found the safe, found the money; and they were just having a quick look round (for anything else worth stealing) when they heard someone coming up the stairs. They hid in the main office, but it became obvious that this was where the intruder was headed: they were trapped.
- Funny thing was, Mr Walcott, whoever it was just had this little torch, like us, and he didn’t switch on the lights, it was like he was coming to burgle the place, like what we’d just done already.
When they realised that the stranger would discover them, they panicked and made a run for it, bursting through the door and flying down the stairs. 
-It was so dark, Mr Walcott, we didn’t see his face and he didn’t see ours, but the thing is, as we were running we heard this heavy bumping like something being dropped down the stairs behind us, and Pete looked round and he saw that it was the man what had been at the door, so we realized then that we must have knocked him over, accidentally, as we was running. 
-What did you do then?
-Well we couldn’t stop or he’d have seen us, and anyway we were shit scared. You can’t imagine. But Pete said the man was lying in the outside doorway, with the door half open, said he could see him and that he wasn’t moving. We didn´t know what to do when we stopped running. We could hardly go back there. But now we´re scared someone might say we attacked this man. That´s not us. We don’t go around hurting people. 
-I’ll deal with it
-Thanks Mr Walcott.
But what could he do? He couldn’t just happen to call round to the office at four in the morning to check that all was well. And if were to go there, just for a quick look, without letting anyone see him; what then? Supposing it was Derek who´d fallen down the steps. Obviously it was Derek. He´d been there staging his own burglary for Mitchell´s benefit. 
He might be badly injured or worse. If it was worse than bad; well then there was nothing to be done and best to walk away. But even if Mitchell found a body, if Derek was just lying there; how did you check if someone was dead? On the other hand if it was just a minor injury then Derek would probably have called for help himself by now, but suppose he wasn´t able to? He could be lying there till morning, maybe losing blood. 
Mitchell decided that he could not trust his own imagination. He was panicking and most likely there was nothing to worry about. Doing nothing was the only sensible option: he only had to persuade himself of that. Wasn´t inactivity what he did best after all? 
His pulse was racing so much that his head was starting to ache. Willing himself to be calm, Mitchell tiptoed back to bed. His body moved quietly enough: only his mind refused to follow instructions. Everyone else in the house was still asleep it seemed, thank God. 
He pulled the bed covers tightly over his thin body, envying the steady breathing of his sleeping wife, but the dark held no comfort. There would be a record of the call he had received. The two idiots might be picked up by the police at any time. Maybe Derek would even recognize them. Why had he trusted them with the job? Why had any of this happened to him?
The next day, when Mitchell arrived early at the office, the police were already there. There was a proper crime scene investigation underway and he couldn’t go inside. They told him that his partner had visited the premises in the night and disturbed some robbers who had attacked him and fled. 
When Sue arrived, Mitchell told her to take an early weekend. It was Friday and they had no work in any case. He phoned home to say that the offices had been broken into. His wife asked if that meant he´d be late home. The police told him which hospital Derek had been taken to and that his injuries weren´t that serious. Mitchell raised a silent prayer to whatever deity ruled his fate. 
The officer only wanted a brief statement from him. Just a matter of routine.
-Fairly clear it’s an opportunistic burglary, sir. Not so surprising when you consider the level of security you have here. You should think about upgrading it. Did you have much of value in the offices sir?
-I er, don’t really know. I’m a bit confused at the moment. I should check with Derek.
-Well I suppose you’ll go over it with the insurers, but we’ll need a full list in case we catch them, or recover any of the missing goods. 
-Do you think you’ll…?
-Catch them? All depends. It’s your basic breaking and entry, not many clues there. If we are lucky and they have form and were too stupid to wear gloves, we may get a print. Anyway scum like this never do just one job so we´ll get them eventually. Then it´ll be a slap on the wrist for them and back to the street I suppose. I must admit though, this job was a little unusual?
-In what way? Mitchell tried not to gulp. The fear was starting again.
-Not so many office burglaries these days. But when they do happen, usually they take the computers and printers. These lads ignored yours.
-Our equipment is quite old fashioned; I expect they took the cash out of the safe.
-I expect so, but who keeps cash overnight these days?
-Well you know, debt recovery, it’s a cash business, working all hours.
-I suppose so. Bad luck that your partner was coming in to the office at that time in the morning, just as the intruders were here, wouldn’t you say?
Mitchell had to get away before his own manner betrayed him. He felt as if his story was unravelling as they spoke, though he kept telling himself that the police would have no interest in a routine burglary. He made the excuse that he needed to visit Derek in the hospital to cut the interview short. 
Derek had broken some bones in the fall, but he seemed reasonably cheerful. He claimed that was due to the strong medication that the doctors had given him for pain. 
-Only a few little breaks, nothing to worry about much. The sad thing is, and I don’t want to concern you unduly Mitch... as you know I had to leave the police force early.
-Yes, they caught you stealing but allowed you to retire on ill health grounds, as I found out not so long ago: but aloud, Mitchell said nothing.
-Injured in the line of duty you know. I twisted my spine. One of those injuries you never really get over.
-And?
-Well, I wouldn’t worry you so much, but in between the medication, when I can feel a little bit more, I’m getting these terrible spasms up my back. I mean, I can’t describe the symptoms clearly just now, obviously I can’t feel anything properly yet, but there’s a chance I won’t be able to pick up the business again. If it doesn’t get better I mean. 
-I suppose you’d be eligible for compensation and benefits?
-Some, yes, so I believe. But the point is; if they catch these villains, they won’t have any money to pay compensation will they?
-I suppose not
-You see, you and I are employees of the company, technically, and the company has insurance for the benefit of its employees. So you see what I’m thinking, if it should come to it.
It was clear enough: Derek was planning to spend the next six months in bed, leaving Mitchell to run a failing business about which he knew nothing. Unless the police tracked down Raj and Pete, in which case he’d be in prison for fraud, he could look forward to bankruptcy sooner rather than later. 
Three days later, Mitchell was on board a plane to Malaga, carrying a false passport that had cost him fifty pounds, and with a little over five thousand sterling in his wallet. No one knew where he was going. The money wouldn’t go far maybe, but he felt like he was making a new beginning. He felt better than he had in a long while.

***

Patricia had never forgotten about Derek Moss and John Obuswu. When she read the report in the local paper about Moss being attacked by thugs at his office, something did not seem quite right. More importantly, it seemed that she was being given a sign. 
The nagging sense of guilt that had never left her demanded that she should act in some way. She had always thought that she should have made more of an effort to speak to Moss privately, outside of the official channels. Now here he was, presented to her and by the sound of it not going anywhere for a while. 
She left it a day or two before ringing him at the hospital. His voice did not sound as pained as she had expected, in fact he sounded almost jovial. He didn’t enquire too closely why she wanted to see him. It was as if the time he had spent talking to journalists about his recent experiences had left him with the feeling that people wanting to interview him was a natural state of affairs. He´d developed a taste for celebrity, it seemed. In any case, he agreed to their meeting readily enough: Patricia didn´t even having to lie outright about why she wanted to see him. 
The hospital close to the centre of town, a long established institution that had started large and grown steadily. The original building boasted an imposing Victorian façade, and housed wards and theatres which must have been amazingly modern in the nineteenth century. The grounds would have been impressive in those early days. There had been enough open space to accommodate the various extensions that had been added over the years, doubling the size of the old hospital, and providing facilities that were more in keeping with modern practice, even if they lacked architectural distinction. 
In the days when carriages drawn by horses pulled up outside the hospital, access would have been ideal. Now it was a struggle to locate a parking place and then the appropriate public entrance. In the main reception, the visitor´s eye was drawn to colour coded bands on the flooring that led away into a maze of corridors with the tenuous promise that the band might continue unbroken to its stated destination. The corridors were long and echoing. Medical staff marched with purposeful tread. Porters gently manoeuvred trolley bound patients between the departments that would conduct blood tests, x-rays, scans, and sometimes even treatments on them. Time seemed to flow at a slower rhythm. 
A lot of the wards were ancient, with shared facilities and not much privacy, but Derek Moss, the have a go hero injured in the course of performing his civic duty, was in one of the newer wings, with natural light and a room to himself. The room was adorned with get well cards from a multitude of well wishers who Derek had never met. There were even flowers. Derek was lying in state, half upright, reclining against an adjustable bed support. He positively beamed when Patricia walked in. 
After introductions, they discussed his condition briefly, Derek confirmed that he had no idea who his assailants had been or why they had been burgling his office, but he recounted the events of the night with some enthusiasm and obviously not for the first time. It was clear that he assumed she was a journalist. Patricia said nothing to suggest otherwise. 
Moss was a big man with small piggy eyes, and a high weak voice that he disguised with an exaggerated, pompous speaking voice. His dark hair was greasy that would not wash out. Lying in the hospital he seemed bloated and pale, as if he would sweat margarine.
-The worst is, he concluded. I shall probably never work again, with this damage to my back. 
-It’s very bad luck, Patricia agreed. You were in the police before weren’t you? I suppose that’s how you had the previous condition. 
Derek agreed that it was so. 
-I wonder; would you mind talking a little about that time?
Derek shifted as if the bed had suddenly become uncomfortable.
-Could you tell me about, for example, when you were working as a detective on the north side of the city? Do you remember years ago, when that black man was killed?
-What has that got to do with anything? Why are you asking me? Do I know you?
-Don’t panic Derek, just a few questions. For the story. 
-There is no story. You’re talking about ancient history. I told everyone back then that I had nothing to say. What kind of journalist are you anyway? You don’t talk like the others.
Since it was a direct question, Patricia had to admit that she was not working for a paper. She told him about her involvement in the inquiry, stressing that it was all in the past and he had nothing to worry about. She was following up for her own personal reasons. He could help her by just clearing up a few details. 
Moss demanded that she leave immediately. He said he had been tricked into seeing her. He would call the staff and have her thrown out. She backed off, but there was another card to play. 
-Derek, I really am not interested in making things difficult for you now. I know all about you being dismissed from the force. It’s like you said, ancient history. But I can see that you are enjoying the attention just now and maybe even thinking you can make something of it. Everyone´s on your side now and there’s no reason for me to spoil it for you. I’m only interested in John Obuswu, and you are the only one who can help me with that. If you couldn´t help me and word got out about your past...
-I would still have nothing to say about that case and I don’t want to hear any more about it. Now or in the future. Understand. Now please go.
He had called her bluff and Patricia had to leave, but at least now she was certain that she was on to something. She was sure that Derek had understood her veiled threat to reveal details about his sordid past, information that would extinguish in a moment the temporary fame that he seemed to enjoy so much. 
If they´d been in court and he´d been her witness, she would have asked a simple question. What is it that you know about events in the distant past that so disturbs you that you´d rather be exposed as a cheat than talk about it? 

Chapter Ten

In David´s dream, there was an angel.
He was a boy who left his father’s house, and walked into the desert.
For three days he walked and on the third day the angel appeared to him, more beautiful than anything he had seen. And he lay with the angel.
He gently turned her over, onto her belly. Her wings were of a whiteness that he could not have imagined, glowing not with an inner light but with the purity of absolute colour. It was white that held the beginnings of every colour that could be. As he stroked the wings she moaned quietly. He said nothing.
-I could lose my job over this, she said.
Then the boy spoke to her, continuing to stroke her soft wings. 
-Briony; I need to find more in my life. I’ve done some good, but only because I wanted to be good. I can only be virtuous through duty.
-What more do you need? She murmured.
Her pale skin was as flawless to the touch as her folded wings.
-To get beyond the conflict between desire and reason. I´m sick of my head ruling my heart. Every day I see people who are kind and happy without thinking about it. They´re better than me; struggling all the time to know the right thing. I envy them.
-You trust yourself too little; or else you think too much of your own part in the world. It doesn’t all depend on you. We could have enough with each other.
When he shook his head, she left. He was alone in the desert. The boy wanted to stay, hoping she might return, but he knew that he had to move on. He began to walk towards the end of the desert. 
He boy walked until the end of that day and for two more days. He walked through the night and the day. The sand burned his feet, since he had forgotten to bring proper desert clothing.
He knew that he was not walking in circles, because he could feel the pull of his destination, but he also knew that his journey was limited by time, not distance. When he had walked for long enough, he would arrive. The sand and rocks and sky scrolled out before him, and he knew without looking that behind him there was nothing at all. And so he walked on at a steady pace. 
Although the desert did not change at all, by the third day he had come to understand its beauty; that was a thing completely self-contained. The landscape had nothing at all to do with humanity. He picked up a handful of sand and examined the grains, individually. He could feel himself becoming smaller, equal to a single grain.
As he continued to walk, the sand became dotted with sparse clumps of hard, dry grass. The scrub became thicker as he walked through it. 
A tall, black skinned man watched him approach through the haze of the sands. The man was old, supporting himself on a stick, or perhaps it was a spear, that was even taller than him. Beads of sweat glistened on the blackness of his shaven head. He was tending a herd of goats.
He did not speak as the boy passed, but only pointed out the way with his stick.
-I lost the sense of myself, the boy told him, whilst I was out there. I listened to so many stories, carried on the wind. Time and wind strip the stories bare. They only leave what is needful. In the end there was only one story.
-But every grain of sand is necessary to make the desert exactly what it should be, a voice told him.
He walked in the direction that the man had pointed, towards an area where the vegetation grew more densely. There were even a few trees; and further on the promise of water.
He passed another man, similar in appearance to the first. This man was tending a herd of sheep. With his staff, the shepherd pointed towards a clump of trees.
-You must be thirsty now, a voice said. She’s waiting for you.
The boy suddenly realized that he was exhausted. He’d not eaten or drunk for days. He began to stagger. He felt so weak that he thought he would collapse before he reached the shade. 
When he came to the oasis, the trees held the sounds of leaves rustling in the breeze, though there was no wind. He heard the gentle cascade of a stream, though the only water was a flat, still pool. The lady was waiting for him, dressed in a long, hooded desert robe. She handed him a glass of cool water.
-I thought I might see the angel again. She shook her head
-Are we outside of time now, mother? He asked. She smiled and shook her head.
-How could you be outside of time and still be?
-But I know this is a dream. How will I remember any of it?
-What you remember is not as important as what you know. Later you may remember differently. Don´t blush: that is your nature.
-Am I doing wrong? 
-With the girl? I suppose so. 
-Will I be punished?
-That depends on you. You are in time, where nothing is lost, provided you still know your direction and the place you started from.
The boy did not understand the message, but somehow when he left the spring behind he knew the direction that he must take. He was restored in strength, his thirst was satisfied and his torn scraps of clothing were renewed. And so he came back to his father’s house, where there was great rejoicing to celebrate the return of the boy who had been lost. 
Later in the night, David dreamed that he was standing in a queue at a shop or market. Some people were being served but his turn never came. The same people kept appearing again in front of him, though he didn´t see how they could have got there. His impressions of the first dream faded a little.
But when he awoke he was thinking again about the girl, his angel. He had to talk to someone about her. It was a problem he had to bring to a resolution, somehow. 

***

It had not been so much of a surprise when David finally announced that he was stepping down as chairman and chief executive of Cromwell Industries for the second time. He´d turned the company around once more. The business was stable and growing, and the top job had become more about dealing with shareholders and the Board of Directors than what David thought of as running the business. Now it really was time for the professional managers to take over. 
Matthew was invited to Cromwell to hear the news. David was proud of the plant and enjoyed showing Matthew round from time to time. Afterwards, they retired to the boardroom, just the two of them and a bottle of whisky that David opened to toast the occasion. Really it was Foster´s boardroom still: David had not altered the office accommodation since that time, and somehow there were just as many pen pushers filling the space as there had been in Foster´s day. Each drained a small glass to honour the business and then David declared that he was giving Matthew an exclusive story. The Examiner could be the first to know that he was quitting. But it was what he told Matthew next, about what he planned to do in the future, that was surprising. He was stepping down from the business, he said, because he intended to devote time to politics. 
So far as Matthew could remember, David had never shown the slightest interest in party politics
-I’ve been a party member since 1993.
Matthew frowned
-That´s two years then. And which party? Don’t look at me like that. I don´t know of many millionaire industrialists who vote socialist.
-You might hear of a few more in future. Times are changing.
-I suppose you know what you are talking about. Next you’ll be telling me the Sun is going to back Labour. I wouldn’t know whether to cheer or organize a wake.
David laughed.
-Don’t worry it won’t come to that. As for me, I’m only just a millionaire, and having a little money changes you less than you might think. You know that I have only ever been interested in money for what I could do with it. I´d hope you´d be above that petty prejudice Matt. That nonsense about the rich man and the camel passing through the eye of a needle.
-I’m sure it suits the rich for the poor to imagine that there is some kind of virtue in their poverty. I don´t buy that. I just think that maybe ordinary people should have their own kind to speak for them.
-But the way they speak. It lets the public school crowd who still rule us run rings round the poor buggers every time they open their mouths.
-There are a lot of working people without much formal education who have good brains.
-True, but unfortunately the other working people don’t believe that anymore. The media treat working class politicians and union men as figures of fun and the voters laugh along. All those hilarious lower class vowels and that twisted grammar. Who cares if they can think? The presumption of holding a public office when they´re no better than us. You and I see ordinary people are laughing at themselves, mocking the idea that their own kind might have opinions might be worth hearing. So much for democracy. Working people don´t have the belief of their parents that they deserve to be treated better than cattle. They find their parents embarrassing as well. What they want is not to be working people any more. I´m am good at making people believe if nothing else. Maybe I can get some of that old belief back.
It didn´t sound convincing to Matthew.
-You told me that politics was over in nineteen eighty two. Remember what we said: voting Thatcher in once was a mistake, but no one knew what she stood for. Voting her in twice showed that the world was changed and greed was the winner. 
-How old were we then Matt? Do you feel you need to stand by every important sounding phrase you ever spoke? I remember I also said that the Labour leaders were more to blame than Thatcher. You were the one who blamed the people; as if they had let you down personally.  Anyway, you were the one who was sure in ninety two that Labour would win.
-And you said it wouldn’t happen. So what’s changed?
-Leadership, in a word. Maybe Kinnock was a good man: bright enough, could see what needed to be done. Kept the party together, stood up to the dilettante tendency. Everyone was going to vote Labour, until they didn’t. He just wasn’t electable: balding, red hair, Welsh; and when he spoke, you had the impression that he meant what he said. He was a good speaker, but he sounded impassioned, and he tried to say too much, which meant that he could sound clumsy. The modern English don´t trust a man like that. They’ll think him a socialist, or that he has some principles at least, however smooth he tries to sound.
-What kind of person will they vote for?
-Someone who looks like an American president, with a solid jaw and a firm handshake. I don’t mean a real president mind; I mean a Hollywood version of a president. We’ve all seen too many movies. And now reality has to try to match our illusions. A leader like that can safely say that he believes in socialism, or the free market, or anything else. The people like to hear his firm declarations of belief, and no one takes them seriously. The public words are only understood as something he has to say to get his own party behind him on his way to power. And the commentators all describe it in those terms. As well he should be tall, or at least look tall when he’s on television, and dress like he works in a merchant bank.
-Why a banker?
-Now bankers are admired. They make more money than anyone else and they clearly don’t give a shit about other people.  Also, so far as anyone can see, they are paid lots for doing nothing. It’s an aspirational thing – a banker is what women want to marry or see their son become, and men believe they would most like to be if they can´t win the lottery or play professional football – that’s how low we’ve sunk. Bankers are seen as smart and unscrupulous, and that makes people think they are fit to govern.
David paused, shrugged his shoulders.
-It´s nothing to do with reality. I´ve met enough bankers; unscrupulous, yes; but smart? Anyway that’s how it is. We admire men who want power, who can pretend to be everyone’s friend, and get their own way without anyone seeing it coming. And there won’t be discussion in the new politics. Everything has to be staged, like in a film. The media reduce the narrative of politics to a few key scenes, and it´s all one take so don´t run any risks. Dramatic impact is what matters. If you want to know what has changed and why we shall win next time, it’s because we have understood these lessons and now we have the kind of leader who looks and talks the part. And after him, the party will need someone like him to carry the work on.
Matthew was astounded. 
-You sound as if you have it all worked out. But if that´s what you think of Blair and his friends, why do you want to be any part of the circus? That I don’t understand.
Of course you understand. It’s what I was meant to do. It’s a duty, almost. You think it would be better to leave the real merchant bankers and their idiot sons to rule us; the same people who´ve been running the show for the last few decades for their own benefit? Look where it’s got us. I´ve been trying to help a few hundred people by keeping a factory open. Don’t you think I had to wade through enough shit just to achieve that much? But I see now that it was no good. You have to make the change right across the board.
Now Matthew understood. Destiny again. His friend was prepared to wear a mask and play to the gallery if it meant that he was the one at the centre of things, because that was what his fate decreed. David had that strange look and that enthusiastic tone in his voice, like something religious. Further discussion would be pointless. He tried to imagine David among politicians, at a party conference, crowded into a hall in some out of date seaside town pretending to share solidarity and tradition.
-You don´t even know the words to the song I expect.
-What song?
-The People´s Flag. You´ll have to sing it at conference.
-I´ll just hum along like I suppose everyone does.
So it was the people’s party for David, but being David, he wasn’t thinking about spending his time fund raising or canvassing for others, maybe hoping for a seat on the council one day. Westminster was only the start of his ambition. It wasn´t long before he was asking Matthew for advice about his plans to take office. The house at Oakland Ridge was again filled with guests of an evening.
-Parliament is a place where people go to lose their sense of direction, Matthew warned him.
-If that´s true Matthew, then it’s a good thing I’ve always got you around to be my moral compass
-I’m serious
-So am I. Don’t worry about it Matt; you´ll keep your precious integrity intact, even if it means you doing nothing useful with your life. Can’t get involved in business because it´s corrupting; can’t get involved in politics because it’s dirty. I just hope, when you look back, that staying true to your ideas will be a sufficient consolation for all the things you only could have done.
-Maybe I’m temperamentally inclined to do nothing. At least looking back I shall be horribly smug and self-satisfied. But I don´t know why you call me an idealist.
-You’re the worst kind Matt, a cynical idealist. You see the world for what it is, but you won´t risk getting your hands dirty to change it. But let´s not talk any more about that or you’ll get angry. We know that politics is a dirty business full of compromise and fudge. People who start off good lose themselves in the maze of it. If you go there, you need to somehow hold on to yourself and keep in mind why you started off into it. But you know me: I’m a fairly straightforward guy. If something is wrong, I’m the first to say it. I might make some bad calls down the line, but I can live with getting something wrong for the right reasons. The main thing is for me to stay grounded, and for that I depend on friends and family. Good friends like you, Matt.
With all the ambition and energy that David possessed, his first difficulty was still to find a constituency prepared to adopt him as a candidate. He was in too much of a hurry to waste time growing a new network of relationships through years of local activism, or even to earn his stripes by managing someone else’s campaign. In any case he had imagined that, given his prominence in the area as a local benefactor and provider of employment, he would only need to announce his availability in order to be presented with a choice of seats. As it turned out, his first enquiries and applications were sidestepped or declined, always with politeness and often with a request for endorsements or donations. 
David had not anticipated the level of resentment that his emergence might raise in the council bosses and local party bigwigs, many of whom had their own expectations. Having worked their ways up through the ranks, these men (they were all men) regarded parliamentary seats that might fall vacant as their entitlement, by law of succession.
Fortunately for him, there were interests working in his favour besides his own persistence. It must have been clear to some invisible senior persons that David and others like him, comparative outsiders, could be useful to them. Perhaps the outsiders could represent a more inclusive vision of what they all still referred to as socialism; but in any case it was clear that they would not owe allegiance to the machinery of the existing local parties. They would be more responsive to the central command. 
Soon after coming to the attention of these persons, David was able to secure an interview for a constituency which would fall vacant at the next election. It was not too far from home and it was considered winnable
However before his name would be put forward officially, he needed to persuade the chairman of the local party to accept his nomination. Matthew knew the chairman. The man was a grizzled old trade unionist and, at heart, an unreconstructed Marxist. He told David that he thought the chairman would rather lose the seat to another party than give it up to a moderate. He said that David would be lucky if the man even agreed to meet him. Even so, a meeting was arranged. 
-Afterwards David reported to Matthew
-It went well. I think we can do business.
-But he’s more old left than Kierhardie
-Well you know, I wrote him a long letter before the meeting, explaining why I was coming late to the party, how I’d been involved in student politics and with some Trotskyist groups – he liked the word “Trotskyist” I think: kept using it himself. I explained that after that time I´d been disillusioned for a while. I had devoted myself to giving practical help for the working class, creating jobs, but in my heart, I always yearned to rekindle my political engagement. And now finally I can see how I might do it. 
-What absolute bollocks.
-Do you think so? Who do you think is going to check a story like that? It’s only a means to an end. And it came to me very easily: I think there is some truth to it, after all. Perhaps that is the internal history of my political journey. 
-You’ll believe it yourself in a week.
-Don’t judge me on how I get power, Matt. Judge me on how I use it. 
Get power, what did he mean by that? How much power did he imagine a backbench MP would have? Matthew only shook his head.
The nomination was secured easily. David gave the committee a milder version of the personal history he’d given to the Chairman, stressing his discovery of social democratic principles. He winked at the old man as he was telling them the story, to let him know that the truth of his radical ideals would be their secret. The Chairman smiled, believing he was telling the other members what they wanted to hear. The vote was a formality. 
More new faces began to appear at David’s house in the evenings: younger faces mostly, men and women who Matthew described as having the blankness of certainty about them. There was a pretty blonde researcher called Briony, and a boy called Hugh with dark hair that grew too little on his head and too much everywhere else. He knew a lot about what he called demographics
Matthew took a particular dislike to one of the blank-faced tribe, a plump, red haired youth who was introduced as Harold. Matthew denied that a person of Harold’s generation could have been christened with such a name. He regarded Harold as an affectation in keeping with the boy’s general character. 
Matthew missed Albert, who had been maddening enough in his own polite way, but had always had something outrageous or just thought provoking to offer. But Albert had not been seen or heard from for months. It seemed that he had abandoned them.
Harold was David’s new favourite. He seemed not to mind that the lad barely spoke, or that when he did he sounded like he was reciting a slogan. Harold would spit out some ill tempered phrase as if he did not see why he should waste his time even attempting to communicate with the ignorant fools around him. Then his mouth would clamp shut and he would continue to glare around the room with barely repressed contempt. David said to Matthew that Harold was young and probably felt intimidated. The aggression was just over compensation for feelings of insecurity. Matthew replied that a bully was a bully at any age. Inwardly, he wondered whether he had ever been that arrogant himself. It was a reflection that he did not share with David, who continued to defend Harold.
-Granted he’s precocious, and ambitious, and ruthless too I suppose. But he’ll grow up in time. And in any case, just because those are qualities that you despise doesn’t mean that I don’t need him. 
The new millennium was only three years away and, if you believed the news, for the first time in decades, people had started to believe that society was ready for change. In Matthew’s case, too many false dawns over the years left him with no faith or confidence that things would ever be any different. All that changed over time, so far as he could see, was that people got older.  Still, he was convinced that David was right about one thing; if a change was coming, it would be people like Harold, not people like Matthew, who brought it about. 
He resolved not to respond in kind to the spite that Harold directed at him from time to time. He knew that Harold saw him as a representative of the hated press, which needed to be manipulated or cowed. Amused tolerance would be a better reaction to that, Matthew decided: it was how Ralph would deal with Harold. To understand all is to forgive all, as Ralph might say, perhaps adding that understanding is a thin consolation of growing old.

***

Matthew didn´t see as much of Ralph these days. The lunchtime drinking sessions were a thing of the past. Everything about work was so much more professional now, and Matthew himself had responsibilities.  One afternoon they met in a public house opposite the Town Hall. It was a nostalgic choice of venue; recalling the afternoons spent in the crowded bar, Ralph sharing his odd opinions on everything and Matthew hollowed out with doubt that he would ever find his own place in the world. 
They arrived separately and Ralph was already most of the way through his first drink when Matthew arrived. On this day the bar was almost deserted: it seemed sad and broken down. Ralph himself looked older and more decrepit, even lonely, without an audience to animate him. His conversation was subdued at first.
-Thank you for humouring me and coming out. I admit I am a little morose today. The truth is Matt; the old world is slipping away from us. Look through this window, at that Victorian block of a town hall. A fine architecture and the maturity of age. All that grimy coating acquired over I don’t know how many years; testament to something. Now they´re going to steam clean the stone. It will look nice I suppose, but the past will have been stripped off. 
-Anyway that’s not my point. It’s a Town Hall: it’s supposed to be a place of work. But it’s an old building and not to the taste of modern administrators, and there are so many of them now. So many things need to be looked into and administered. They have to have more space.
-So now behind the Town Hall, there´s the Civic Buildings, where the work is done. They keep the old place clean and try to find occasions to use it, like a ceremonial uniform that one of those old colonial governors might drag out of the wardrobe every now and then to see what damage the moths have done. 
-What I mean is, there´s no purpose to it anymore; the place is just a monument. And I’m the same my boy. I’m as much use as those stone lions over the road. It happens to everyone and everything: the usefulness wears out. No good complaining about it. Fact of life. People turn into statues eventually; temporary memorials to the person they used to be. 
 Matthew didn’t interrupt. In this bar he only needed to nod to the landlord for their next drinks to be placed on the counter. He got up to pay the man and collect the full glasses without speaking.
- I was in love once you know, Ralph continued. Followed someone to another country just to be near them. That much in love. It turned out badly. Nowadays my prick might as well be stone like those bloody lions on the Town Hall steps. All that’s over for me.
 -Instead I can look forward to more years of impersonating myself. You know how it is. Every year something that you can’t do as well or can´t do at all. Fading health, fading eyesight, worrying about becoming stupid. It’s the human condition if you live long enough to suffer it. It’s just that some days, I’m not sure I have the taste for it, or the patience for that matter.
Matthew told him he was having a bad day. Depression comes from time to time, to old and young, he said. He reminded Ralph of some of his own comments about life being full of experiences and every part of it being in some way different to the last. It was difficult to know what else to say, there was some truth in the words. Ralph was not so important to the paper these days. Others, like Matthew himself, had passed over him. And his behaviour was not acceptable sometimes; in fact it could be quite inappropriate. Privately Matthew thought that maybe he should set about fixing up a sabbatical for Ralph; give him the chance to follow some other interests for a few months.
But Ralph was not quite finished. 
-I’m a dinosaur Matt; not yet extinct, but on the way. One reason is this idea I have that the point of life is to try to do things as well as you can. The world has progressed beyond that notion. We have passed to the age of the accountants.
-The law of accountancy is that you take everything and anything and cut back the quality so it is just a little easier to produce. Then you edge up the price a little so that customers are paying a little bit more than they should, and finally you persuade everyone that what you offer is good enough. The process goes on year after year. Everything has to be made a little worse than it could be: chipping away at whatever contributes to the sum of human happiness in order to have a slightly bigger number on the bottom line of a ledger somewhere. 
-Mediocrity is what’s wanted now, at best. They´re all chasing each other down to the lowest common denominator, and they celebrate cheapness and revel in it. No one believes that it demeans them to consume rubbish, because in some idiotic way they have persuaded themselves that being conscious that it is rubbish elevates them above it. That’s what your post-modernism is: the metaphysics of our time. It applies to culture and everything else, as if you can eat all the burgers you want without getting fat, provided you laugh about them being disgusting turd packets of cholesterol whilst you gobble them down. 
It was a typical Ralph rant, which cheered Matthew up. It sounded like the old man recovering his zest for life in general and all the things he hated. Later he reflected that maybe Ralph´s words were intended as a personal challenge laid down to himself. 

***

And then he had David to worry about.
When he got the call from David it seemed like they would have a relaxing Sunday ramble. David picked him up early in the morning and they chatted about nothing important on the drive through the Dales. It was a while since they had spent time together like this and Matthew thought it was a good sign that David was finding time to relax. They reached Buckden and parked the car near to the inn. There was still a little of the morning chill lingering in the air as they pulled on their boots and started on the tiny single track lane in the direction of Hawes. At Hubberholme, they turned right past the old churchyard and up the lung testing farm track which climbed to the path that circled the valley head. They paused at the crossing of a stream that cascaded busily off the high ground. David poured coffee for them from a thermos.
-I’ve been having an affair, he announced.
The coffee was hot. Matthew reacted as if he´d burnt his tongue, but it was only surprise.
-Oh, right. Cheers. This is good. Strong and not too much sugar.
Matthew hoped that his expression said that he had absolutely no interest in hearing what came next, but David was not to be put off.
-I need your advice Matt. You have affairs all the time.
-Do I? Is that what you think? I don´t remember us talking about it.
-Well, I need to talk about this. The girl is special. You don’t know her. She’s young; a researcher, very committed, very passionate … about her work.
-How many times?
-We´ve seen each other, like that, on three occasions; or do you mean, how many times?
-Just occasions. I don’t want to know the sordid details. Well, don’t be so gloomy David. Three times is not an affair.
-What is it then?
-Not quite a one-night stand, but more like a fling.
David seemed genuinely annoyed. Matthew was showing more than usual interest in the landscape.
-Are you taking the piss?
-No, but I don’t think you should take your problem quite so seriously. It sounds like you´ve had an accident and I´m sure you´ll get over it.
-I want this girl. She´s my angel.
-Sounds like you’ve already had her.
-But I don’t want to wreck my marriage
-Unfortunately, you´re not the first man to be caught in that trap.
-You know you can be infuriating when you are this cynical Matt, but still I need your help.
Matthew took a moment to compose himself before speaking again, in a more serious tone. He said that he sympathised, but in his experience there was not much a friend could do to help in times like this. It was just a case of listening to the patient talk themselves through their own condition.
-Some part of you already knows what you will do, he added. It’s just that you feel bad to admit it without a struggle. Your finer feelings demand that you suffer indecision, because otherwise you´ve just been stupid and selfish. So maybe I do know about affairs after all. Well, then, tell me the story David. We’ll know your answer once we get to it. Otherwise all I could do would be to give you some objective advice that you’ll ignore and that would make us both feel wretched.
-For now I´d like the advice. I feel wretched as it is.
-You won’t like what I have to say. You’ll tell me it doesn’t apply to you.
David shrugged. Matthew sighed and looked out across the valley floor, then at the stream that would bubble on long after they had passed. He spoke without looking directly at David.
-First thing is that you should leave out of account this person you´re proposing to leave your partner to be with. I assume that’s what’s on your mind. It’s not likely that the two of you are the star crossed lovers you imagine. Even if you are, the stress of the divorce will probably kill that relationship. Usually men don’t settle with the lover who breaks their marriage. All the remorse and self pity that the excitement of the new thing keeps at bay is only stored up for later. If I was as cynical as you think, I might say that it´s normal if the lover is being used, whether you know it or not, to provide an escape route.
David scowled.
-With us it’s nothing like what you describe.
Matthew did not respond to David´s comment.
-Second, everyone knows that after a break up, women fall to pieces, then put it behind them and get on with their lives. Men get a rush of euphoria that tastes of freedom; then they sink into years of depression. 
-Third; sad to say, you are not unique. From what I can see, casual sex outside a long term relationship happens to most everybody at some time. It turns out that even these birds nesting here, that partner for life, still make illicit calls to other nests. Our genes have their own survival strategies and they are insistent. If you give in to them once or twice in your life, it’s not such a big deal; unless you make it one. 
-There´s nothing casual in how I feel about Briony, David growled.
-You asked for my advice. Just one more thing. Complete honesty is a great thing in human relationships but it has its limits. I can see you´re not going to leave Patricia. For god´s sake don´t say anything to her about this. Confession´s just a coward´s way of shifting a burden off the one who is in the wrong and dumping it on the other. The sinner feels better because the deception is over, and the innocent party feels like shit.
David scowled again.
-That´s it? That’s your advice?
-That´s my objective advice that I said you would ignore.
-It doesn’t feel like you’ve described my situation at all.
-Of course not. So now tell me your story: only do me a favour David and remember the last thing I said.
If David remembered Matthew´s advice he did not take it. Three weeks later, the crisis had broken and the tearful lady researcher was out of their lives for good. Later, David admitted to Matthew that he’d confessed the whole thing to Patricia that same Sunday. He said that she seemed quite dismissive of it, made him feel like he’d shown a lack of discretion or committed a social gaffe rather than that he’d destroyed his marriage. She refused to take seriously or even discuss his protestations about his feelings for the girl, until eventually he began to see for himself what an idiot he had made of himself. 
He said that he´d insisted on sleeping downstairs on a couch, even though Patricia had laughed at the empty gesture and told him he was being depressingly conventional. But in the night, he heard her get up and go to the bathroom. She was there a long time, he said and he had to lay there listening to her sobbing. He told Matthew that he was prepared to spend the rest of his life trying to be worthy of this woman for standing by him when he had been so weak and useless. 
It seemed ironic that David, so pragmatic in his public life, should be the one who insisted there could be no dirty secrets in his relationship, while Matthew, supposedly the man of principle, preferred discretion to disclosure in matters of the heart. And in the end, he reflected, I know little enough myself about human happiness. I don’t know whether David is a much better person than me, or just a complete idiot.
He´d never said anything to Patricia about his conversation with David that Sunday, and she´d given him no reason to believe that David had confessed that evening, even though two days later Matthew and Patricia were sharing the same bed. 
They weren´t actually having an affair: in any case, both of them believed that to be true, however the case might look from the outside. They met regularly. They were old friends. David was away a lot; and even if Matthew had the impression that the couple were not so close even when David was home, that did not come into the equation. Almost always, their liaisons were completely innocent, and even when they were not, both Matthew and Patricia found it easy to revert to the behaviour of friends next time they met. 
Matthew never visited the Oakland Ridge house when David was away any more. He and Patricia met at lunchtimes, usually at their favourite restaurant. It was natural since they both worked in the city. But Matthew´s flat was very near, and sometimes it was easier to meet there. In fact the thing that was spontaneous and almost an accident seemed to happen only after that call from Patricia suggesting a changed venue. Everyone in Matthew´s office apart from him knew that if the phone rang on Tuesday at a certain hour, and he closed his door to take the call, it meant that he would be anxious and irritable for the rest of the morning.
Matthew thought of their situation as regrettable but civilised, if he considered it at all. Most of the time he managed to avoid thinking about it. 
He remembered that on that particular Tuesday afternoon, Patricia had been telling him something about David and he´d been more irritated than usual at having to spend so much time hearing about her husband. But it had not been anything about the affair. She said that she had started to worry about David.
-You mean, in case he should find out about us? Why, has something happened? Matthew had willed that his voice should not sound too anxious.
-Don’t be silly. There is no us; you know that better than I do. I’m talking about this mystic faith or belief that he has. It’s frightening sometimes.
In fact Matthew had noticed that David´s personal mania about his purpose in the world had started to take on an almost religious tinge, but what could he do about it? With Patricia, there was always talk in the bed, and mostly he could let it wash over him. He liked to hear the talk: it was never like that with his girlfriends. He would have found bedtime conversation with them off – putting, but with Patricia it was a reassurance that what was happening was only cosy and safe. In fact they often spoke about the girlfriends. It made Matthew smile to hear Patricia steering him away from one girl, or suggesting that he get closer to another. She could be so obvious about trying to manipulate him that he believed himself immune to her influence. 
She would be talking to him until just before the end, though he seldom remembered about what. Then finally, she would become transformed into someone he had never known and would never know. There was something dark and animal about her orgasm, as if she was falling down to a black secret place where he could not follow. For a moment he glimpsed something dangerous, with sharp claws and teeth, and then he was overtaken by his own animal self, demanding relief.
There was no sense of joining in that moment of greatest intimacy; or if there was, then what was joined was not their individual lives, but some part of them that came from the deep and did not answer to their names. It was impossible to say whether those were the moments when they understood each other perfectly or only learned that they hardly knew each other at all. 
But after that less than a minute of shared anonymity, silent and holy as it felt, Patricia would pick up the thread of conversation again, and he was grateful for it. Her cool dispassionate tones were a lifeline back to himself, reassuring Matthew that the act had not been taken as a promise giving the lie to the limits they had set. Patricia did not want or need a future with him. They could be comfortable again once she started to speak. What had just happened was reduced to a manageable scale; as if they had gone to the theatre together, or shared a meal. 
Always and inevitably, the conversation came back to David. Like this comment now about his famously unshakeable self belief. Matthew was tired of hearing about it, though he answered as reasonably as he could.
-David’s had this idea that it’s his destiny to do important things for as long as either you or I have known him. I thought you went along with it to be honest. If he’s adding religion to the mix, I can’t say I’m surprised. Right back when you two got together, I remember Tim predicting that David might become the first atheist to be made a knight of the Vatican. 
-What did you say to that?
-I think I only said that he wouldn’t be the first one by a long way.
They talked about other things, but Patricia couldn´t leave this subject.
-Some of the things he says sound so odd coming from him. I mean, you believe what you like at home, or in private. But he wants to be in politics. 
-You used to talk like that yourself, Matthew reminded her. But yes, I read an interview where he was talking about his faith being important to him. The interviewer seemed embarrassed and couldn’t get off the subject quick enough. It seemed odd at the time and it did make me wonder what faith he was talking about. But we´re talking about David here. You can assume that he´s worked out how it will play before he said anything. 
-He’s serious about it. I mean he talks about “being received into the church” one day, and how it might affect his political prospects; as if the world cared one way or the other.
-It’s just another enthusiasm. It will pass. What did you say to him?
-I said that if he announced a conversion to Rome, it would make him look eccentric. Better to wait until he’s finished with politics. I’m afraid I fell into that pompous way of talking about it that he has
Matthew couldn´t resist.
-Patricia, you´re putting his eternal soul in jeopardy. Imagine if he died before the glorious day, unconfessed and damned, because you had made him put it off.
-Don’t you start. I just don’t want him to make himself look ridiculous. He wants to be seen as a - conviction politician - I think they call it. It’s just some idea he has picked up from American politics. We´re English after all. It makes us uncomfortable when someone starts talking about god. 
-You’ve changed from the serious Catholic girl I remember. 
-It’s different for me. I grew up with religion. It’s more of a habit than a conviction. I don´t get carried away with it. Poor David, it’s niggling at him all the time, even if he doesn’t admit it. He suggested going to mass with me next week. I hadn´t even thought about going myself. It´s not something I do usually. I don’t know how I should manage if he became like that all the time. Nothing worse than a zealous convert you know. They’re like those people that give up smoking. 
-You gave up smoking.
-Well I’m not pious about it, I hope. Anyway, I still do have an occasional cigarette, when no one is around. I’m not very good at giving things up entirely, as you know very well. 
And she´d kissed him then. Matthew couldn´t remember anything in their conversation that suggested she´d only just discovered that her husband had been sleeping with another woman, or that she´d spent a night crying about it. But then, he couldn´t remember feeling any strong urge to share David´s confidence with her. Both of them had known, without either being aware that the other knew, and they kept the parts of their lives in compartments that were sealed so tightly that even the big things didn´t leak out. It´s exactly as Pat says, he thought. I may write the news, but I never see what´s happening.
It wasn´t long before they met again. Patricia was feeling better, and it was nice to have Matthew to talk to. She was alone so much otherwise, even with her many friends; and the two of them had known each other for so long. It was true that he was a hopeless idiot and had almost no conversation of his own; but then that was probably why he was so attractive to all these needy and wrecked women who latched on to him. He gave them a mirror for their own lives; a flat, calm, reflective surface. Then eventually they bored him and the trouble started. 
She was musing about it after they finished, lying comfortably naked together. She thought that feeling the warmth of another´s skin next to your own was one of the best things.
-There’ll be a problem for you one day, she told him. When you finally meet someone who isn’t completely wrapped up in herself, you’ll have to talk about your own feelings to fill the space. I wonder how you’ll manage.
Matthew didn´t answer, and there was silence for a moment. Her thoughts turned back to David. That trip to France, the break that he´d said they both needed, had really set him off again. The spiritual thing wouldn´t leave him alone, it seemed. They had driven across via Dover. The plan was to fill the car with cheap champagne on the way back, and they had spent a night in Rheims; a pretty town. It was David’s suggestion that they visit the Cathedral. 
The outside of the place was merely beautiful. Inside was one of those impossibly high, endlessly buttressed spaces that seem to exist outside of time, bathed in the light of a different world. The way the sound carried through the dry air was extraordinary. It was as though, in coming through the door, they had entered a dimension that was almost but not entirely the same as their own: every small detail held subtle differences. 
She had noticed straight away that David was greatly affected. They didn´t pick up any of the printed guides, but wandered around taking in everything at first hand. Then they came to the great window that had been made by Chagall. She supposed it was the brightness of it, the warmth of the colour of the thing, that made it so special; but there was something more. Humanity, she thought. Patricia could see and respond to the power of it, but David was overwhelmed. He stood before the window for minutes, looking up with tears rolling down his face, oblivious of where he was. 
Afterwards they took a coffee at one of the pavement bars. They talked about the marvellous cathedral and how inadequate speech was to describe it: impossible to say anything at all without sinking into cliché and hyperbole. You could only try to express fragments of emotion, that might echo in the heart of someone close to you deeply enough for both to know that they had shared the same feeling, even if the feeling itself could not be spoken.
-We are close, still. Patricia said to him. Strange to think of it now, in the arms of another man. That makes me happy. But that window. It was something else again. It did something more to you. I thought I could see it fully, but you saw more than me.
-It was the angels, he answered. I could see them. I was watching the angels dancing in the light around the glass. 
So far as she could tell, he was completely serious. She worried about how it might affect their futures; a politician of vision was one thing, but a politician who saw visions was quite another. But in any case the world beyond their own little lives was moving on.
Soon there would be an election. All the smart commentators said that Tony Blair’s new vision of the Labour Party would finally make the party electable. New Labour would sweep away an exhausted conservative administration that had its reputation for competence and even honesty in tatters after too long in power. Politics would never be the same again. 
This was taken as read by everyone except people like Matthew and the Labour party itself, traumatised as they were by decades of internal bickering, and defeats snatched from the jaws of victory. On the left of politics, whether you read about it in the media or heard about it at David’s house on an evening, there was an obsession with the need to keep discipline and not to break ranks. Don’t try to do too much about this at first; don’t let the Tories get to the right of you on that. Make sure there are plenty of fresh faces. Above all don’t fall into the stereotype; wear a good suit and try to sound grown up
It sounded like an impossible trick; walking a tightrope carrying an anvil. Matthew struggled to understand what any of it had to do with turning around years of government by the rich for the rich. When you listened to the speeches, and read what everyone had to say, it began to sound as if a Labour government would not be so very different to the other kind. All the parties were targeting what they called the middle ground, like two fat men trying to sit on the same small chair. But if so many things were going to stay the same, where would the big change that everyone was getting excited about come from?

***

Ralph had been missing from the office for a few days. It wasn´t the first time, but it worried Richard Tuttle more than usual. Normally, before one of Ralph´s episodes there would be warning signs, like the plumes of smoke and ash that precede a volcanic eruption. But lately Ralph had seemed quiet by his standards.
After work, Richard drove round to the flat. He sat in the car for a while, parked at the kerb, reminding himself that his sense of foreboding, like Ralph’s absence, was nothing new. 
Richard had a key, so that he could feed the cats when Ralph was away. He knocked anyway, but there was no answer.
Ralph’s flat was on the upper floor. One of the cats brushed against Richard on the stairs, hungry and indignant. She complained at him with a long and petulant mew. Richard ignored her. All three of them were bad tempered creatures that despised him, even when he was being their food provider. Their sense that he did not unconditionally adore them was enough to stir them to resentment.
The flat was laid out in a modern style, though the building was old. There was an open plan lounge at the top of the staircase: it was deserted and the whole place had an abandoned feel. Richard called out softly, but no one answered. The door to the kitchen was open. He opened the fridge and found it empty.
He found Ralph in the main bedroom. Here again the style was bright and modern. The high ceiling was angled to match the pitch of the roof, and the roof beams were left exposed, to make the space feel more like a loft. They were made of heavy timber, supported by sturdy cross pieces. It was a roof that was more than strong enough to support the weight of Ralph’s thin body, hanging from one of the beams. He’d used a belt for the noose, buckled to another that was looped round the beam and nailed. It looked like a fragile arrangement, but it had proved fit for its purpose. 
From the look of it, Ralph had climbed onto a chair back, balanced for a moment, and then kicked the chair over. Richard knew little about how such things worked. He could only hope that Ralph had looked into it properly, and that he had managed the business well enough so that his neck was snapped by the fall. Better that than hanging till he choked. 
The body was very still, stiff even. That was what shocked Richard most, though it should have been expected. It was the rigidity that gave him the sense that the living, breathing, speaking being that had once been was now turned into a mere object. You could call what was hanging there a body, but that would sound as if the thing suspended from the beam retained some essence of personality or animation; that something at least of the spirit remained. But at that moment, Richard only felt that Ralph was gone, and this dead skin was just something to be cleared up and dealt with: it was even too commonplace to be horrifying. The resemblance of the lifeless hanging thing to Ralph was only a cruel joke.
Richard went back into the living room and sat down. He felt sadness but no anguish: his mind was calm. The things that needed to be done and the people who needed to be told began to crowd his thoughts, unbidden. He realized that he’d rehearsed it all before in his head, many times, without ever intending to. In his imagined versions of the moment, it had been pills that were the cause, or only a failure of some vital organ hastened by the years of ragged excess; perhaps even a fall or some other domestic accident after drinking himself insensible. 
Hanging seemed too melodramatic for Ralph’s taste: too much a grand gesture and too unambiguous. Hanging required you to be settled and determined in your mind, for the planning and the execution. And leaving a body hanging, needing to be cut down, was like a mute reproach to the world: a statement in itself. That was the way kids did it; the ones who were too screwed up to realize that dying was just the end, and that after it didn´t matter what anyone thought about you. He couldn´t imagine that Ralph would have been thinking in that way. Maybe he just didn’t trust pills. 
It was a surprise that he hadn’t made any arrangements for the cats, but then they had the cat door as a route of escape. Probably Ralph thought they might move on and find new homes, rather than providing something else for Richard to worry about.
He rose, and walked to the kitchen. There was food for the creatures in the usual place. Richard was used to the task and did it mechanically. Better ring his wife and explain he’d be late home, and why.
He knew that there were practical things that must be done, but he felt reluctant to start, as if something heavy were pressing him back. He knew that as soon as he spoke to another human being, the business of the living world would reclaim him, and his final connection to Ralph would be broken. He sat down again, just for a moment. 
-It will hit the lad hard, he thought. 
One of the cats, white and black, sloped up to him and began to rub against his shin. He stroked its head, absently. Fickle monsters, he thought. 

***

-I found a note, Richard explained to Matthew, a few days later. – Just six words. “Done because we are too many”.
-That’s a quote. Thomas Hardy, I think.
-Yes.
-In Hardy’s story the father killed his family, then himself, because he couldn’t afford to feed them. 
-That´s right. 
But Ralph lived alone, Matthew said.
-I thought about it, Richard answered. It’s meant as a joke I think. He´s saying there are too many of all of us. Humans. 
-Makes sense I suppose. But it’s hardly a reason to kill yourself. 
-I can´t think that Ralph ever lacked a reason to kill himself Matt. I think what he needed were reasons not to kill himself. I remember he used to like that phrase from Sartre – nous sommes de trop. Same idea. People are superfluous.
-It says nothing about himself. Although it does sound like Ralph, and I wish it didn’t. If this had to happen at all, I´d prefer to think that he did it when the balance of his mind was disturbed. Better that he was temporarily off his head than that it was a considered decision. Like he´d passed a verdict on himself. I keep remembering the jokes we used to make when we had to report a suicide. It was only gallows humour I know, but now it leaves me feeling guilty. 
-That’s only part of being human lad. Laughing at it all is how life goes on. 
Then Richard said that Matthew would have to deliver the eulogy. Matthew could not understand why it should be him, which seemed to shock Richard.
-You were his best pal, he said.
-Was I? Matthew seemed genuinely surprised. Surely lots of people knew him better than me. The two of you have been friends for years. 
-But he thought the world of you Matt. He had a great ... affection for you. Did you really not know? Think back, do you see? It has to be you, or you’ll be sorry afterward. Ralph would have wanted it. 
Matthew felt that he had no choice, but still he had no idea what he should say. He did the research diligently, in a way that he supposed Ralph would have approved; meeting old friends who could give him a more rounded picture of Ralph’s life; reading back through the archives. There were no close relatives that they could trace. The time was short and a solitary existence yielded little in the way of anecdote. The external details of Ralph´s life could be summed up in a few sentences, but what to say about the inner man?
Richard and Matthew resolved that for present purposes Ralph should be considered Church of England, although they had no evidence of his faith or lack of it. The service was booked at the crematorium by the ring road, on the north side of the city. It was held on a sunny morning. The funeral people had managed all of the arrangements with quiet efficiency. They advised that the day was a busy one with a number of ceremonies scheduled, so everyone must take care to be punctual. Richard had sorted out somewhere for drinks and light refreshments afterwards. 
Matthew owned a dark suit, not black but near enough. He met Richard at the funeral parlour and rode with him in the official car. There was only the two of them. All the way, the rustle of paper in the right hand pocket of his suit reminded him of the speech he would have to give. He kept putting his hand in the pocket, without thinking, as if wanting to check that the words were still on the paper. He noticed that his hands were sweaty and wondered whether the occasion or his speech was to blame.
At the crematorium, they stood in sunshine that seemed to mock the purpose of the day and shook hands with various people who Matthew had never seen before. Richard seemed to know some of them. There were many more people than Matthew had expected and it seemed odd that they wanted to express condolences to him and Richard, as if the occasion were to mark their private loss. They were cast as surrogate relatives for the day. 
They needn´t have bothered so much with the floral arrangement because there were many bouquets sent or delivered for the service. The mourners were of all kinds, but mostly older people. Shaking hands with strangers, Matthew kept seeing the same expression in eyes that made a point of meeting his. It was a practiced expression of restrained sadness, that gave Matthew the feeling that they were all part of a ritual he didn´t quite understand, and some response was demanded of him that he didn´t know how to make. 
-I feel as if these people are expecting me to tell them something. What should I say? he whispered to Richard; but Richard was as much in demand as he and had no time to reply.  
Mindful of the time, they were ushered inside. Matthew again became painfully conscious of the crumpled paper in his pocket. Some music that he didn´t recognize was playing. It didn´t sound religious, but played on an organ it seemed to fit the occasion. 
The minister began to speak and the calm rhythm of his words made Matthew believe for the first time that yes this was really happening; that Ralph was gone forever; dead whatever that meant, and that this was their goodbye to him. Absurdly, the realization came as a shock. At first the minister said a few words about Ralph and who he was. His words were carefully chosen and sensible and he didn´t make the mistake of speaking as if he had known Ralph personally. Still this preamble made Matthew more tense, and he was grateful when the minister began to speak the formal words of the service.
And all the time the sheets of paper in the right hip pocket of his suit seemed to grow heavier and heavier. 
He´d spoken briefly with the minister before the service; a solidly built man of middle height with reddish hair, bald on top. His manner was kindly in a practical way: the sort of man to reassure that everything was happening, and would happen, as it should. It was hard for Matthew to imagine that such a man could believe these words about god and eternal life.
Even so, the recital of the familiar words was comforting in its familiarity, though some phrases that had been updated for modern ears seemed to jar. What would Ralph think of that? But then what would he make of the “in sure and certain hope of resurrection” that this practical man declared so confidently. How could anyone who was not deluded talk about a certainty of resurrection without pretending? But then there was a pause and he was being gently summoned forward. 
Standing at the front of the chapel, looking back to the congregation, everything looked different. Matthew realised for the first time how crowded the place was. He couldn´t remember seeing so many, outside. Expectant faces, turned to him. The service had been understated and in keeping with the occasion, but it could have been for anyone. Now it was up to him bring them something that would make the occasion personal to Ralph: that would make it different from all the other services that would be conducted on that day and all the days that came after. So many services; so many lives forever ended. 
Matthew took the notes from his pocket and saw that his hands were shaking. He hadn´t prepared himself to be so nervous; he´d only told himself there was no reason that he should be. That had been a mistake. Looking at the words on the paper, he found he could hardly read them. He scanned the lines and saw only meagre scribbles that were inadequate for the occasion. 
He made a start, concentrating on pitching his address to the back row of the congregation. At least he should be heard. As he came to the end of each sentence he could detect a rising tremor of anxiety in his voice, in sharp contrast with the strong soothing tones of the minister. The chapel was quiet for him. Only one or two coughs punctuated his words. 
From his research he could speak about Ralph´s early life. It was ground that the minister had been over already and it was soon covered. Then he said a few words about Ralph joining the staff of the Examiner, and after that it was time to talk about the man he knew. He stuffed the first page of notes back into his pocket and scanned the second sheet. 
Matthew tried to speak, but words wouldn´t come; only a sort of noise that he didn´t recognize as coming from him. He folded up the rest of his notes and put them away. 
-I, prepared some words as you see. I wanted to tell you about the time I knew Ralph. I thought of the right things to say, the usual things. But you all knew Ralph. He never said the right things or the usual things. That was never good enough for him. He only wanted to get to the heart of the matter, even when that made a difficult situation for everyone. 
-He was embarrassing to be with sometimes. Not that I never saw him embarrassed. 
There was some shuffling in the pews.
-I never saw him behave as if anything out of the ordinary was happening, even in bizarre situations, so I suppose he would feel quite at home today. 
-Anyway, it’s good to see so many of you here. Ralph knew many people and everybody who knew him loved him in some way. I don’t know how someone who inspired feeling like that came to be so much alone. I don’t know whether he wanted more from people and couldn’t ask for it, or whether he was genuinely content to be so much in himself. There´s a lot I’d still like to ask him, and now I never can. It makes me sad.
-Whether from the congregation or from himself, Matthew felt a growing urgency that he should get to the point, if only he could find what it was. He remembered the warning about the next service starting and that he should not take up too much time: but still he had not found the right words.
-Many of you knew him better than I did. But I do know that Ralph was wise and kind, even if he had a tongue that could drip pure acid. And he was strong. He decided who he should be, and made himself that person, by an effort of will and intelligence: I admire him for that. And he was my friend, and he never took shit from anyone.
There was not much else to say, and if he said more, afterwards Matthew could not remember it. At the moment that he spoke to word “friend” he had a revelation of how deep a friendship he had experienced with Ralph. The rest came out automatically, until a moment later he was appalled at his own choice of words. 
The minister continued the service as if nothing had happened, but Matthew returned to his pew and endured the rest of it in the certainty that his ears were burning crimson and that everyone in the congregation must be staring at the back of his head. Outside, Richard assured him that his words had been fine and that everyone had understood and appreciated the sentiment, but still Matthew found himself unable to go on to the reception. He made his excuses and left Richard to pick up the pieces as usual. He felt that he had let Ralph down by his inarticulacy more than by his minor profanity.
And afterwards of course life continued, although it seemed that work would not be the same. With Ralph gone, Matthew seriously considered, for the first time, the idea that he might leave the Examiner. He thought about giving up his current line of work altogether. Perhaps it was time to strike out for something more serious. He was almost forty years old and still puzzling over what to do when he grew up. 
Gradually that sense of restlessness passed. He stayed on. In a way it felt as if a responsibility had passed to him. He and Richard were the elder statesmen now, and Richard was not many years from retirement. He found himself reacting to certain situations as Ralph would have done: not the hedonistic, riotous Ralph, but the pedantic wise old head who insisted on standards being maintained and who the others looked to for a particular kind of guidance. He heard his own voice speaking with more authority, and sometimes wondered if that confident tone could really be him. 
His own life remained a mystery to him, but living it became less of a struggle, at least most of the time. He was sustained by the thought that if he could hold on to the few things he was sure of, even if they amounted to no more than a few rules of grammar and syntax, and maybe the rudiments of a house style, then the rest might take care of itself.    
It was just occasionally, on nights when he was alone and unable to sleep, or else he woke up thinking about Ralph’s death, that his thoughts were troubled by the idea of suicide. Not that he was tempted to it, but he remembered the reports of similar deaths that had been allotted their few brief lines over the years. Richard was right; you had to laugh, because each such death was a challenge, much more when it was someone you knew. 
Usually you could explain it easily: people with terminal illnesses and in pain; crazies; teenagers at the mercy of chemical imbalances; cries for help that went wrong; inability to cope with the decrepitude of age. The histories were sad in themselves, but they had their own logic. Ralph’s case was different: it was as if he had weighed his life in the balance and come to a rational decision to end it. He’d acted on the judgement quite calmly. On his worst nights, the last challenge that Ralph had thrown down for Matthew was to ponder what verdict should be pronounced if his own life were to be weighed in the same balance. 

***

It was some time after Ralph´s death, and David could tell that Matthew was still affected by the death of his colleague, even if Matthew himself couldn´t see it. David was sure that the preoccupation was unhealthy. He suggested to Matthew that he ought to visit Tim. It had been a long time, and maybe it would be good for both of them. Spending time with Tim might help Matthew recover some perspective on life instead of moping. Matthew was surprised that David even knew where Tim lived. He should have remembered that David never fully abandoned his friends. He was more surprised when David gave him the address, just around the corner from where Matthew´s mother lived. 
Tim welcomed him warmly enough, asking in the same breath if he had a smoke. Matthew said he didn’t. Tim admitted that he knew that Mrs James was a near neighbour. He had seen her in the street a few times, without introducing himself. He said that he was not over anxious that people should see him as he was just now.
-I mean, don’t make polite noises; this place is just a complete shit tip, right? And it´s not as if I look like I´m out of place here.
-It wasn´t an assessment that Matthew could argue with. 
Tim managed to find two mugs that passed as clean enough to make tea. There was no milk. They squatted on a mattress in the living room, sipping the scalding brew. Tim said that this was the room he lived in, mostly. He didn’t go upstairs much: there was no point and anyway the house was too cold. Matthew nodded.
-One of the windows is broken; you can see it from the street.
-I’m going to get it fixed soon. Got any spare cash?
-It doesn’t look as if cash would be good for you. You’re using a lot of drugs I suppose. Looks like it anyway.
-It depends on what you call a lot. David comes to see me pretty regular. He always leaves money.
-And how does that help you?
-Well it helps me not to have to do the things I’d have to do otherwise to get hold of all the drugs you were talking about. But then again David was never such a miserable, self righteous prick as you. Is the tea all right?
-It’ll do. What happened? Tim looked blank. To you I mean.
-I got off the bus and I never got back on again. That’s all. Don’t come over all pious and concerned and don´t tell me it has anything to do with the bloody war. I never was a real soldier anyway. I´m just someone who went through the system and decided to have a break. It´s only that the break stretched on for a while and now here I am. You know, once David stopped inviting me round to the house - I don’t blame him for that mind. I was out of order in so many ways.  Anyway after that it was like my final link to the proper world was gone. And I didn’t miss it. At least he keeps in touch, not like you.
-I remember you running round the house with that toilet seat around your neck, hitting people with the toilet brush. It was funny, looking back anyway, but not very pleasant.
-Like I said, I´ve no complaints. I´d become smelly I remember.
-You’re smelly now.
-But here there’s no one to mind; only you, and you can piss off if you don’t like it. 
-Tim, you could get yourself cleaned up and start again any time.
-But I’d have to want to, wouldn’t I? Anyway, you asked to hear my story so shut up. I was quite happy for a while, you know, with the money they give you for turning up each week to prove you haven’t died. But then they offered me this job working in the dole office. And when I say offered, it´s not like you can turn it down. It’s another level of hell where they send the long term claimants, as if we haven’t got enough problems. Their way of saying; you lot are so shit that this is the only job you are fit for and don’t imagine we can’t make your life worse than it already is.
-So I was there for a time and I did try to make a go of it, in my own way. I mean, you can find something to laugh at anywhere can’t you? But that was the trouble. No sense of humour, none of them. So here I am again. I never caught the habit of work like you three. David wants to run the country one day. Patricia thinks she is doing god’s work because she is making a lot of money representing liberal causes. You I don’t know. 
-Just a kind of cowardice in my case, I think.
 -Something like that, probably. Anyway I never had a family to support and I can’t see the point of being bored all day when there don’t seem to be enough boring jobs for the people who want to do them. 
-I’ll come back and see you again soon.
-I’ll try to arrange my social calendar to be at home. Thursdays and Fridays I´m at my club. The one on the corner. Beer’s cheap but I can´t go when the bingo´s on.
The meeting gave him something to think about, but if David had encouraged Matthew to see Tim to make him count his blessings, he should have realised that given Matthew´s nature, he would instead start to question that his own way of life was truly better than Tim´s, though at least he could afford soap.

Later that month, Patricia told Matthew she was pregnant.
-This is strictly in confidence, David doesn’t know anything yet
-But why not?
-Sorry, we’ve never spoken about this? David can’t have children; it’s a sperm thing. We’ve known about it for years of course. I supposed everyone suspected. Catholic wife and no children.
-But then, who is the father? And why are you telling me about it before him?
Patricia gave him one of her hard stares.
-You are more hopeless than even I expect Matt. The father is you of course
-But we never, well I mean, we have, obviously. Now and then; not something we’re proud of – accidentally sort of.
-Keep going Matt, you’re hilarious. I never cease to be amazed at the capacity of men to file their separate experiences in neat little boxes, keeping all the inconvenient ones locked safely away. Don’t panic, I never imagined that we would be running away together, but would it surprise you if I reminded you that you have accidentally fucked me on fourteen separate occasions in the last twelve months?
-I never thought of it like that. I suppose it’s true. I assumed you were – taking some precautions
-It seems you can’t protect against idiocy. And stop talking like a sex education manual. If I get a few years older I shan’t need to take precautions, shall I? Nature will take its course.
 -You sound like you are thinking of keeping it.
For a moment Patricia struggled to suppress a violent response; then she spoke quietly and calmly. 
-It. Yes of course I shall keep it. Health permitting, thank you for asking. I wasn’t hoping for a child Matt, not consciously anyway, but see it from my perspective just for a second. Think about biology.
-Didn’t you ever think about adopting?
-Too humiliating dear. Now I suppose we might, after we have one of our own. In any case, the politician’s wife with adopted children. You know what would be said. There’s always some grubby hack sniffing around trying to make out that the husband’s gay. Thank god we’re not Tories at least. It seems like all the men in that lot have some kind of depravity. Gay might be the least of it.
-You’re not Tories but you´re not really a politician´s wife yet.
-Thank you for reminding me, but I shall be. David will be making his maiden speech at Westminster soon. I have to think of how things look. And now we shall be parents too.
They remained standing a few feet apart, as at the moment when Patricia had given him the news. It was an awkward distance, but Matthew did not know whether to advance or retreat. Should he embrace her now; and if he did should he be friendly or passionate? His instinct was to shrink back, but he remained immobile, conscious that he must look ridiculous. 
-What about David, what will he say?
-Firstly, he’ll have no idea that the father is you, unless you do something incredibly stupid, which you won´t, will you? Good: that´s the most important thing I need to hear from you. Second, he’ll be a little hurt when I admit that, once or twice when he was away, I gave in to loneliness and temptation and consoled myself with meaningless liaisons with strangers that were purely about physical relief. Half an hour later he’ll be up and about painting a nursery and planning schooling for the baby.
The part about meaningless and purely physical hurt more than it should, though Matthew had no idea why. I suppose that is how I should have described it myself he thought; but even so. He knew that what she said about David was right, but where did that leave Matthew? 
He would be father to a child that he would never see. Worse than that; he would see it all the time, unless he changed the pattern of his life entirely and gave up visiting Oakland Ridge. He would have to watch the he, or she, growing up without being anything to them. Though he´d always claimed that he never wanted children. Now he could hardly acknowledge, let alone understand, the curious mix of emotions that flowed inside him. 
It seemed no time at all before Patricia had her daughter. They named her for David’s mother. Patricia seemed contented, even a little softened. Not long after though, she returned to practice at the bar and the childminder moved in. 
The career was still going well and motherhood did not seem to slow her down. It was not unusual to see her name mentioned in the specialist press. There was distance between her and Matthew now, if they had ever really been close. Now they were almost formal with each other. She did tell him once that she saw even less of David these days, and that she thought that she had stopped minding. It was the natural rhythm of a relationship between two busy people; and to be expected. It was more important that little Evelyn should be happy.

***

Just a few weeks after Patricia told him about the baby, Matthew met Amy. 
He was always meeting girls, but this one was different. She was younger than he was, pretty and intelligent, but that wasn’t it either. There were a lot of clever attractive women who were on their own and had no more sense than to find Matthew attractive. But with Amy, he knew right from their first conversation that some new feeling was coming into his world.  Amy told him that she felt the same way. 
He couldn´t analyze his feelings, and he was frightened to try. He found it easier to say what Amy was not than to describe what qualities she had. She was not talkative, and she was comfortable with silence: this was something new in his experience.
Matthew was used to his girlfriends doing most of the talking, but even the witty ones used to wear him out eventually. He hadn´t realized, until the responsibility passed to him, that it was not so easy to drive a conversation along, particularly as neither he nor Amy liked to talk about work. But it felt like another new thing to have someone genuinely interested in what he had to say.
And it didn´t matter so much what they said anyway, because she had this wonderful calm about her, as if her own serene self possession radiated warmth to him. She laughed at him for saying so, but Matthew could imagine that she had never experienced a serious moment of anxiety in her life. 
Her light hair was long and straight and seemed to be hiding something: a gentle smile with just a hint of mischief. Whatever she happened to be smiling about gave way to laughter quite readily, but it was soft laughter that was not at all mocking, and there was a secret in the laughter. She was perfect, he decided. The secret was as simple as that. 
From the start they understood each other without words. Matthew was forty years old, and felt that maybe he had done enough talking already in his life to last for the rest of it. To find someone with whom he could be quiet, but still be so close, felt like - well it felt like happiness. 
-We like your new friend very much, Patricia told him. You should have come to see us before now. I don’t know why you’ve been hiding her
-I haven’t been hiding her at all.
-She’s just too good for you. Very pretty girl too. You hardly stayed two minutes, but it was obvious that you were close. She’s not like your other women. Don´t let this one get away. You must come round to the house. We’ll have a small dinner party. Something intimate
-Intimate for you is anything less than twelve people. I don’t even know if Amy does dinner parties.
-You’re worried we’ll frighten her. Well that’s good. You´re not usually so thoughtful. Just the four of us then. When shall we arrange it?
-I think I should ask Amy about that.
-My god Matt, such consideration from you. It must be serious.

To some, it seemed that David Thomas was not only a new member of parliament, but a new kind of politician. He didn´t match the usual stereotypes of the opposed interests, and he´d won his seat in a constituency that normally swung between conservative and liberal candidates. The media showed some interest. Local radio asked him for an extended interview. It would not give the same exposure as his brief television appearances, but it would be a first opportunity to explain his ideas in something more than a rehearsed phrase; a media baptism of sorts. Matthew could hear David´s enthusiasm when he spoke about the event: he felt obliged to offer his help, but wasn’t surprised or disappointed when David assured him that everything was in hand. It seemed that Harold claimed experience of working in radio, however unlikely that sounded to Matthew. 
-I don’t suppose anyone really listens to this sort of programme, David told Matthew; playing it down for his benefit. I never would, before now. How about you?
It was a fair comment: if Matthew heard anything interesting on the radio it was usually by accident, switching between channels when the music stations became too irritating or repetitively programmed. However, once his mother learned of the planned broadcast, it became something of a family occasion. As the show would go out on a Sunday afternoon it was arranged that Matthew and Amy would visit for lunch and afterwards they would listen to the interview together. 
The interest that his mother showed in the progress of Matthew´s friends was touching, reflecting a life lived at one remove he thought. He was nervous about the broadcast for that reason. He had every reason to fear that his mother´s high expectations for David´s public debut would not be met. Amy could see that he was tense: he wasn´t sure that he could explain the reasons clearly.
-My mum thinks that everyone should say what they mean, he told her. She´s heard me and David putting the world to rights over the years, and now maybe she thinks he´ll say some of those things on air. She´s always said what a good speaker he was, and she thinks such a lot of all our abilities. It might hurt her to hear what he actually comes out with.
But there was no help for it, and that Sunday found them seated around a portable radio that was balanced on the television set, digesting a traditional lunch and waiting expectantly, like a wartime family from another age gathered to hear the wireless broadcast of news on the Home Front. Perhaps a crackling voice would inform them that rationing was about to end. Amy and Matthew sat together on the sofa and he was grateful for her hand in his. 
Mrs James sat smiling through the brief introduction and description of David´s career to date, but as the interview progressed she became more pensive, as if she was waiting for something. She didn´t say anything, she only became more still and erect in the high backed chair that she preferred to the armchair. David spoke about continuity and something that he called an inclusive vision, which seemed to mean not changing very much. The longer it went on the more unsettled they all seemed to become. Even Amy, who was not paying much attention to the words, picked up the mood. 
The final straw came when David was asked to comment on the Thatcher years. He responded that his party disagreed with much of what she stood for, but given she had been the most successful prime minister of modern times, electorally, it would be foolish to deny that there was much to admire and learn from her career. She had led the nation through difficult times and seen through some painful, but necessary, changes.
-Mrs James stood up and clicked off the radio. 
-Time for a cup of tea, she announced firmly. Amy you don´t take sugar do you? 
And with that she retreated to the kitchen.
David was at his new London flat when Matthew next caught up with him, by telephone. He was spending a few days a week down there now, getting back home as often as he could. 
-Do you remember, Matthew asked him, you telling me that Margaret Thatcher was an evil witch, simple minded and wrong on every issue and deserved to boil in her own cauldron? Seemed like you´d changed your views when we heard you on the radio.
-Don´t be intentionally stupid Matt. How do you think your media colleagues would have served me up if I´d said what I really thought? Half the country´s still in love with the image of that woman; more than ever now that she’s safely out of the way. 
-So you don’t really believe what you said?
-You can’t deny she could win elections
-Yes, she convinced me that a mass of people who prefer not to think can be persuaded to agree with a small-minded, simplistic, ignorant view of the world. I never really doubted it. It´s more difficult I suppose to show them another way, but I thought that´s what you were about. 
-Exactly my point. You and I are always saying the same thing in different ways. We only disagree on what to do about it. People are selfish and weak. They´d rather have easy answers to difficult problems. So you want me to stand on my soapbox and preach that they should all be better human beings, and where does that get us? The way I see it Matt, we either leave things as they are or we should lead. Leading means starting from the place where we are, not from where you’d have liked to be in nineteen seventy nine. Leading means feeding people some of what they already like, and then little by little drawing them after you, in a new direction. Wherever people stand, they have to think that it´s only common sense to be there. You change them by shifting the ground under their feet, not by telling them they’ve been deluded for the last eighteen years.
-But that’s not the same as what I was saying at all. I’m talking about inspiring people with a vision. You’re talking about herding them like sheep.
-Most people are sheep, they just need better shepherds.
-Like you? Who made you the good shepherd?
Matthew imagined David standing in his half empty flat, the phone in one hand and his face upturned to the invisible sky.
-One of the differences between us Matt, he replied; is that I believe in some things that are fixed, beyond ourselves. Goodness is unchanging.
-History would suggest otherwise.
-Matt you want everything to be more complicated than it really is. There´s a simple choice.  We can all cling tightly to our principles like you. Maybe it makes you feel better but it achieves nothing. Or we can act. If we do nothing, how many bad things happen that maybe we could have stopped? You can never stop all of them. Does that mean you shouldn´t even try? But to act, you have to deal with the world as it is. 
-You know, your mother wrote me a letter about what I said. I respect your mother, but most ordinary people are not like her. They don’t see themselves as a class in society, needing to stick together to struggle against being exploited. They don’t see that they belong to any group bigger than their own family. Society does exist, but it´s invisible. Our own people look for the chance to get something by being smart: buying shares in a government sell off, or investing in a building society that goes public. Sod thy neighbour. No one works in heavy industries now; sharing the same work as their mates and their lives defined by it. Industries have gone. All that’s left of them is nostalgia of people like you.
 -Do nothing and it´ll be more of the same. We’ll go further and further down that slope of not caring about each other, until there’s no way back. So if I have to tell some lies now to help steer the ship off on a different course, I´ll do that. 
-Doing good by stealth?
-If you like. Why not?
-You´re telling me that people are so awful that you have to trick them into being good. So what´s the point of them? You may as well let them go. I could be having this conversation with Patricia but about the church. I suppose the Pope tells himself he has to keep up all the bullshit otherwise the poor blind sheep won’t know good from bad and the world will come crashing down. 
-Do you think God would want it to come crashing down?
-I don´t know what god would want. I don´t believe in him. And I´m not sure I know what you believe in any more.

It was the closest that Matthew and David had come to a serious quarrel; but now Matthew couldn´t despair of the world, or even of David, because now he had Amy. For the first time in his life he was able to believe unconditionally in the existence of a special emotion that people called love, and he found that it made the whole world seem like a different place.
His long time friends saw a change in: he was less aloof, they said; more considerate; genuinely interested in other people. He caught himself smiling at work; having inconsequential conversations with colleagues. He wondered what kind of monster he must have been in his life before. 
Early on, he introduced Amy to his mother; an unheard of step for Matthew. Mrs James was charmed: she described Amy as shapely, with perfect skin, and added that her eyes were extraordinary: clear and brown and somehow deep. Matthew noticed the eyes more once his mother had mentioned them, but really he had known them always. Maybe all his life he had only been waiting to find these deep untroubled pools that his spirit could fall into and lose itself.  
Mrs James told her friend that that her son had met a nice girl who was pretty, if a bit quiet, and it seemed like he might be growing up at last.
David wasn´t around much, but he met Amy once or twice. Matthew and he kept in touch by telephone, and David heard enough about Amy in those conversations to understand that his friend had found something important. Patricia was fascinated and enthusiastic, warning Matthew that he must not let this girl escape: she was definitely the one for him. 
It wasn´t long before Patricia wanted to hear about the sex. Matthew was uncomfortable: sharing the details with Patricia seemed disloyal, but then they had always talked about everything. Shared information was really the base of their relationship and sometimes Matthew thought that it was the female side of himself that was close to Patricia. He couldn´t hold back entirely. He could have said that there was nothing of the desperate clutching between two empty souls hungry to be filled; that sex had been the moment when he made some connection to humanity, but now he felt connected with Amy all the time, and so their lovemaking was languid and sensual, rather than urgent. Instead he only said that it felt different to what he had with the others; what Patricia called his damaged girls. Everything seemed more peaceful and slow.
-I´m not sure I get that, Patricia shook her head. You know what they say about angry sex: the only kind there is.
Matthew tried to find other ways to describe his feelings:
-I´m different, in myself, he claimed. If we´re walking on the street and we pass a beautiful girl, I can say, yes, she´s pretty. I don´t feel I have to pretend not to notice or say she´s not my type. Because it´s only that I´m admiring the girl, not that I want her, and I know that Amy can see it.
-Well, don´t get too enthusiastic in your admiration, Patricia warned him, laughing. Girls can be more insecure than you think. Even girls as saintly as your Amy.
With David he was more open. He said he was certain that if such a thing as love existed, that was what he felt for Amy. He only regretted that he´d come to this age in life without knowing that feeling before. He´d been dishonest in his other relationships without even knowing it. 
-But; David pointed out. If you´d known that feeling before, you probably wouldn´t be with Amy now. Maybe you should just relax and enjoy your good luck for the first time in your life. Don´t give in to your need to find problems with everything
-All I worry about is how Amy feels about me. You know, there´s always one partner who is more loved than loving. It was always me before. Only because I suppose, looking back, I was never really that bothered. But now that isn´t so and it could be me that´s hurt. And Amy´s a lot younger than me.
-They usually are Matt, David laughed.
-But what if she changes her mind?
David should have realized that the first seed of doubt had been planted in Matthew´s mind: inevitably, it would grow and start to cast a shadow over his happiness. Amy and Matthew would be free of the shadow for a time, but the darkness is patient.
Neither of them was the sort of person who cared to map the future. Matthew had never even been able to plan holidays in advance; much to the annoyance of his earlier girlfriends, who´d suspected with some justification that it meant he was not sure they would be together by the summer. For him there was a trace of superstition in it too; as if speaking a possible future out loud might curse it. 
Amy wasn´t lacking in commitment or scared of tempting fate: it was more that she accepted certain things as inevitable; like the two of them being together and all that implied. It wasn´t that she didn´t know her own mind. She only seemed to be on such good terms with life that it flowed in her direction. Matthew thought that Amy understood life and knew what she wanted from it. Perhaps she even knew what she wanted from him. He accepted that whatever secret she possessed could not be spoken; and so they were both content to inhabit the present, and to let time be something that flowed around them. 
Their lives became more intertwined, without much discussion. Amy knew how she felt. She heard what Matthew said about how he felt and took him at his word. Everything else was simply natural. The time spent travelling between their respective houses was just wasted. She moved in to his flat. They had more time together. Amy said that he should be certain to keep up his interests and friendships, but he only wanted time to spend with her. When he could see and hold her he felt safe from the doubt and regret that had plagued his other life.
But that was how the darkness started. Matthew brooded: it was what he had always done. Gradually, he stopped seeing his own friends. He preferred to tag along with Amy and her friends when they met after work. Then it seemed that he was more comfortable when they didn´t go out at all. Amy said that she didn´t mind if they did nothing, she was happy for them just to be together. He was asking her what she minded all the time these days: it sounded foolish even to himself.
He started to plan and organize things that just the two of them could do together, except he needed reassurance that Amy would not find them boring. She was younger than him and probably she needed more excitement. He started to be interested in the sort of music and clothes that had bored him when he was Amy´s age. Amy was only confused, and had no answers to his nagging questions about what she might want to do. It was as if Matthew was pressing her to develop some consuming passion so that they might share it. 
He was spoiling everything, and the worst was that he knew it, but could not stop. And now the future started to obsess him.
David told him he was being an idiot.
-You know more about girls than I do, but don´t you think you might drive her away? She fell for the person you are Matt. How are you going to keep her by turning yourself into someone different?
-I can´t see where we go from here. She´ll get tired of me. Some days I think it would be better for me to break it now. It will hurt too much if we grow apart.
-I don´t know about Amy, but I´m tired of you. Dump or be dumped; is that the best you can do? It sounds like playground stuff.
Patricia couldn´t help him. She said that it was clear to everyone that he and Amy were meant for each other, and that with all the women he´d known he should be able to trust the emotions he felt now and know that he had something rare and special. But now Patricia had her baby, she didn´t need him, he thought, even though he´d never been more than a surrogate for David really. He remembered the other women, and the strategies he´d used to get free of them when the thrill was gone, all too well. 
He doubted his own ability to make a commitment. He knew that he was devoted to Amy now, but what would come of that in time. They´d met just after the thing with Patricia finished; just after he´d learned about the child. That could be just chance, or that he´d not been open to a deeper relationship before because Patricia meant more than he thought. It could mean only that he´d needed to move from one temporary emotional crutch to another. How would that feel two or five years from now?
He started to hate himself and believe that he wasn´t worthy of Amy. Leaving her would save her from him. What would happen to them if he stayed? What life could he offer? Patricia told him that was Amy´s business not his. Amy was perfect, but Matthew had always believed that perfection was an illusion. At any rate he was sure that he was far from perfect himself. 
Other times he would reflect that if his memories were distorted; if Patricia had kept him on a leash for so long, or if he´d been so shallow that he could never connect with those other women, then it meant that he was even more pathetic and lucky to have Amy than he imagined, and he should hold on to her however he could. He saw now that the other girls, the ones that David called his conquests, had never really been lovers. They hadn´t seen him at all, absorbed in the dramas of their own lives, in which he was allotted only a minor role. He´d been content to remain invisible, only providing them an empty space for a time, until he ran away, which was what he did best. Only now he couldn´t run. 
One night, in the middle of it all, he asked if she´d like them to be married. Amy gave one of her smiles
-I should think not, she replied. I´m not sure what you mean by “be married”? It sounds a bit half-hearted; like you would consent to being a husband, but you wouldn’t want to go through all the tedious business of a wedding. It doesn’t even sound as if you are talking about you and me. More like a general enquiry as to my preferences. You´d have to do better than that to convince me.
-Of course I meant us. I’m sorry, that was clumsy I know. I’ve never proposed to anyone before.
-I’m only teasing Matt. But remember you have been married before.
-I know. Still, that was just something that sort of happened. Now it´s different.
Amy thought for a while, and then she said that she hadn´t yet considered marriage enough to know whether it was for her or not. She would need to understand what it was for and why they might do it. She added that if she ever decided that she did want to be married; then she expected that she would want to be married to Matthew. And she was smiling again. 
Matthew thought he felt relief at her reply. He wasn’t sure why he’d raised the subject in the first place. It was a catharsis of sorts: not that he didn´t want to marry Amy, but he was forced to ask himself why she would want to marry a man who had turned himself into a mirror image of the man she met: insistent, whining, on edge all the time; finding significance in the most minor things; obsessing about possible futures. He realized how close he had come to destroying what they had, and although he couldn´t altogether turn from the path of self destruction overnight, little by little he began to recover happiness.
She pulled us through, just by staying herself, he thought of Amy. She´s not stupid: she could see what I was going through; but she kept talking to me as if I was the person she knew, not the deranged maniac I´ve been. More than ever he could see what a special person she was and understand that his first obligation was to do his best to deserve her.

***
 
David had arranged to meet Matthew at his mother’s house. Amy was going to be there too, and later, if he turned up, Tim. David wasn´t sure whether Matthew or his mother was behind the invitation, but he did feel that he owed the old lady something more than the impersonal MP´s response she´d had to her letter to him, and he would support any effort to break Tim out of his current situation, though he doubted it could be done. He knew that Matthew wanted to show him the part of David´s constituency where he´d grown up, and he rather feared he was due to be lectured at. 
Even so, he hated to be late for any kind of meeting, but it was tough to know how much time was needed for a journey across town these days, even on a Saturday. Parts of the city were permanently choking on traffic. 
David drove through the centre, round the inner loop road, and through the complex system of urban highways which funnelled a never ending stream of cars and heavy vehicles between the different motorways that converged on the city. Newcomers told him that the local road system was impossible to navigate, and he supposed it was true. 
The centre was growing, outwards as well as upwards, and now it was insulated from the inner suburbs by a ring of tarmac. The rows of terrace houses were gone, together with the breakers’ yards, cheap office space, and warehouses that had crowded among them. In their place moving lines of vehicles; and between them, banked expanses of grass that no-one ever stood upon. It wouldn´t be long before the office workers would be able to pass from their suburban homes to their expensive parking spaces without catching sight of the poor estates.
He steered the car around the curve of the final interchange and took the spur that headed south, passing under a deserted pedestrian footbridge. Abruptly the image of civic modernity faded. The road narrowed and its surface became uneven. The old buildings crowded in closer to the highway.  There were people walking about in the streets, plump mothers herding young children and the scrawny elderly hunched over in their raincoats.
It was a strange sensation to drive this route after so many years: not because the streets were unfamiliar, but because they were so little changed, when everything else had moved on.
David took a short cut, making a right turn by the old park. He was pleased with himself for remembering the way. But the park was a mess. It had not been a pretty space to begin with, but what bored youths had vandalised the council had ignored. The grass had died or been burned away in patches and broken glass was trodden into the hard ground. The houses that fronted the park did not look too bad but there was rubbish in the street and in the front yards. It was a place no one cared about any more. 
Matthew’s mother lived a few streets further on, where the houses were neater, and the gardens grew things that were planted rather than dumped. The cars and the windows looked clean, but there was graffiti on the wall of the chip shop at the end of the street that was now a Chinese takeaway. It must feel like being under siege living here, he thought. 
Mrs James welcomed him in, offered him tea and asked him to sit in the front room, all in one breath. Instead he stood in the tiny kitchen talking to her while the kettle boiled. They had only met a few times, but he remembered her well and knew the type of lady she was. If you wanted a conversation, the kitchen was the place to have it. In any of the other rooms, she would be up and about constantly, picking at half finished tasks or finding new ones that needed to be done. Here in the kitchen, where the work was done standing up and everything that was needed was close to hand, was the nearest she would come to being at rest. 
-It’s been a while David. I’m sure that Matthew will be along soon. He’s late for everything, as you know. Not very polite of him though, when you´re so busy. He told me he´d like the two of you to spend some time in the neighbourhood before dinner: or lunch I should say. I don´t know what he thinks you´ll find, but anyway it’s always nice to see you.
David shrugged.
-We´ve known each other too long to worry about Matt being polite, but I can´t stay all day. He said something about showing me how the ordinary people live.  I think he believes I’m in danger of forgetting.
-He wants to save your soul from the damnation of politics. 
-I don’t think Matt believes in souls.
Mrs James took on a more serious expression.
-Well, I’m not sure that I do either. But after what we heard you say on the radio, I suppose that has something to do with it.
-I read your letter. You didn’t approve.
-You said some things that you don’t believe. At least I hope you don’t.  If you do, you’ve changed your opinions a great deal. I supposed that you were saying what you did because you thought it was what voters wanted to hear.
-I’m trying to be a member of parliament. To do that you have to keep being elected.
Mrs James gave him a hard stare.
-I understand that way of doing things. I can’t say that I think much of it. I’m a simple person, I know. To me there’s right and wrong. You do your best to say what’s right, as you see it, then people can choose whether they agree with you or not. It might not be an easy path but if you leave it I´m not sure where you end up. Some of your friends in parliament seem to say whatever is most convenient for them.
-They´re not friends. And if I did that, I would know, inside myself, that what I was saying was wrong.
-Would you, David? Are you sure? Matthew tells me that you do believe in the soul. He says that´s why you trust yourself to make good choices. That’s lucky for you. The rest of us have to rely on principles.
David smiled. 
-You make it sound as if you think that I don’t have any.
-I’m sorry; I didn’t mean that. I meant to say; most of us need some fixed rules that we can live by. Rules that are bigger than ourselves, even if we reason them out for ourselves. We don’t hear some inner voice that might tell us one thing on one day and the opposite thing the next. I don’t believe I could trust in that.
-I wouldn’t have expected you to have thought so much about it.
-Because I’m a practical old woman? Well it’s a practical matter isn’t it? Besides, I’ve lived a long time. And I never had much school to make me think the same as everyone else. I´ve had to work out my opinions for myself.
David took a sip of tea. The conversation was turning out to be more interesting than he had expected.
-Do you read the newspapers Mrs James?
-I buy one of the cheap ones, out of habit, for the puzzles and the TV pages. I listen to the radio to find out what´s happening. The papers are funny though, the way they twist everything. Once you understand the trick, it’s like a game to imagine what really happened or what someone might have really said, from what they report; and how the paper has changed it to make you think about it in a certain way. I suppose most people read newspapers that way now, as entertainment.  I hope so at least. 
She paused to offer him a biscuit, David declined.
-It´s popular to think that people are stupid, she continued, but I don´t believe it. Most of them just prefer to let themselves be carried along by all the nonsense because they don´t think they can do anything about it – I suppose to make their jobs and their lives easier. Oh, and I do read the Examiner of course – well, usually. Some of it is a bit dull I admit, but don’t tell Matthew I said so. 
-If you understand how the media works, then I suppose you know why I have to be careful about what I say in public?
-I’m not sure that I do. I understand it might make things easier for you, if you pretend to believe what everyone else says they believe, but what’s the point of it? What are you trying to achieve? Matthew says you don’t need the money, which I suppose is why most politicians are in it, so what can you get that is worth being dishonest for? It ruins a person, telling lies. It becomes a habit like it did for Matthew´s father.  And that’s what they are you know - lies. I’m sorry I have to put it like that, but to me, when you’re saying things that you know aren’t true, or that you don’t believe, then you´re lying. 
She seemed to be quite upset at what she was saying, but having made up her mind to say it, she was determined to finish.
-If you said, this is what I think and if you agree with me, then this is what we’ll do, I’d stand up and cheer that even if I wasn’t sure it was the best thing. But the pretending…in the end what is the difference between someone who pretends to believe the wrong things, and someone who does believe them. They both end up doing the same thing: one because he wants to and the other because he’s trapped into keeping up the pretence.
They heard an engine noise outside. Mrs James peered through the kitchen window.
-Looks like Matthew is here at last. Is that your car outside the house? It’s nice, but I expected something a little grander.
-Yes, that’s one´s mine. I’m not really interested in cars. 
-Well good for you, neither am I and there are too many of them round here. You should see the speed that some of the young ones come down here, and hear the noise they make. Anyway you let Matthew and Amy in and go through into the front room. Maybe we can talk some more about this later. Or you can make up your mind that I am a crotchety old lady who you don’t need to take seriously. I know I talk too much. It comes from living on my own I’m afraid. If you think I’ve been rude I hope that you won’t hold it too much against me. You see I like to talk, but I never picked up the habit of gossip. 
David opened the door for Matthew and Amy and everyone crowded into the narrow hall for a moment, exchanging greetings.
-Our Brenda´s joining us later, Mrs James told her son. Just her, not the family.
-It´s going to be a squeeze then. 
Matthew realized that his sister would have insisted on attending when she found out that Tim was a guest. She strongly disapproved of him and no doubt felt that her mother should not be without moral support. 
-Oh there´s plenty of room, Mrs James insisted. The more the better. It´s only a shame Patricia couldn´t join us then we would have a full house.
-She would have liked to be here, only she´s busy. A new case, said David.
-Yes, Mrs James replied. 
She and Amy made a fuss of each other and then Amy followed Mrs James into the kitchen saying that they should leave the boys alone. 
Matthew and David stood in the hall a moment longer. Matthew intended to show David round the tiny dwelling, which he´d only visited three times before and never seen beyond the front room, but now he felt a strange reluctance to begin. Whenever he came home, the house seemed smaller and poorer in reality than the child´s memory that reasserted itself when he was away for a while.  In fact the place never altered. The rooms were too small and the light was not good, but it was always clean; always neat. Nothing replaced only because it was old, but only as it had become broken or used up. 
The house had never been cluttered with objects or furniture. His mother was not sentimental about belongings, though she held fiercely to a notion of place. He had not been able to persuade her to move to a better, more easily managed place, even though some of the memories of this house must have been bitter for her. As the years passed, she seemed to be getting more utilitarian about possessions, taking a pride in having nothing useless in the house. The children had long been forbidden to give her Christmas presents; senseless trinkets that were a waste of money, though his sister’s kids were allowed to give small gifts to Grandma, most of which were carefully packed away in the spare room. One or two of these cheap items were on display, providing ornamentation. Besides these, a few framed photographs and some books, the house contents were functional
It was an old terrace house, but it was owned, not rented. Matthew explained to David, as they inspected the view from the front room window, that the real decline in the area had come in the streets of former council owned houses that had been sold at discount to tenants in the eighties. Salesmen had come knocking door to door, offering cheap loans for the people to own their own homes. After them came the double glazing and cladding firms, all offering easy terms. 
Once they became homeowners the former tenants found they were living in the same dwelling, but their expenses had increased and they were expected to maintain the property. Some of the new owners moved on; making a good profit but finding nowhere cheap to move to. Before long, it wasn´t possible to move on, because no one wanted to buy a house in an area that was quickly becoming run down: only landlords who were buying up properties to rent and didn´t mind the condition so long as they were cheap. The landlords set rents that were more expensive than the old council lets, and the houses still weren’t looked after. These days, most of the tenants were out of work, so the council had to pay the expensive rents as housing benefit. It was progress of a sort.
The houses in Mrs James’ street were not like those run down properties, but the rows and rows of disregarded terraces all around had their effect on the area. Matthew suggested they should see the rest of the house and then wander the streets for a while. Again he paused; uncertain whether he was ashamed of his old neighbourhood, or all of this was just too personal. He led the way up the narrow staircase that rose too steeply in the confines of the hall. The downstairs ceilings were high and the floors were thick. The windows were large and old and the rooms were draughty. He remembered a home that had been warm enough, with a family living in this small space. Now that his mother was alone, she should have somewhere warmer, but Mrs James claimed that she never felt the cold, or if she did she simply put on her cardigan. 
There were three bedrooms: the smallest was Matthew´s, where if you were already inside you had to sit on the bed to let someone in. His sister’s room was a little bigger, although she was the younger, because it was assumed that girls needed more space. David commented that his earliest memories were of a house quite similar, in the time when his mother was still alive. 
Matthew sighed.
-My father´s been dead for years, at least as far as mum is concerned. He could be dead really now. No talk of him in this house. 
-Aren’t you ever curious?
-What’s the point? What would it change?
Mrs James shouted up the stairs to summon them for a cup of tea. 
Afterwards they did find time to walk the local streets. The area was on the edge of David´s constituency and he was not familiar with the streets, but Matthew had not seen this as an official visit. He wanted only to remind David of the sort of place they had both come from, and the hopes and fears of the people who still had to live in these places. 
It was the middle of the day, with not many people about, but Matthew was slightly shocked, to see that David slipped easily and quickly into his role as politician the moment they were in public, stopping people they met, fixing them with his famous brighter than life greeting, introducing himself before asking a few simple questions and nodding wisely at the reply. Some of them already recognized him of course. He’d been on television, which meant he was famous. 
Matthew was more surprised than annoyed, even after David had them knocking on doors then heard himself referred as the local boy made good who wrote for the paper. I should have seen this coming, he realized. 
He had to admit that it was instructive to listen to David saying the same trivial things to so many people, and hearing it coming out as fresh as the first time every time. How could you train yourself to do that? Why would you want to?
After the door knocking, David said that it had been really good to hear about the big issues in the area.
-Everyone seems to want to talk about crime, Matthew noted.
-Or immigration
-Well immigration affects people around here more than it does us, in our middle class suburbs.
-Don’t get defensive Matt; I wasn´t making a judgement.
They passed the metal shell of a car on waste ground. The wreck must have been there for some time. Rusty ochre was gradually replacing smoke burned black. Fragments of rubber that had spun away from the blaze when the tires ignited lay all around.
-This sort of thing is quite new, Matthew explained. You didn’t use to see it. Before they would take the nicked cars up into the woods, rip out what they could and then set them alight. But there’s no money in it now, so now they just drive around for a while, see if they can crash into anything or get the police to chase them. If not they have the bonfire where it´s not so far to walk home.
-Doesn’t that give away who they are?
-Everyone knows who they are. Anyway, the next thing is that someone calls the fire brigade, sometimes the kids themselves who call, so the firemen have to come to put out the blaze and the kids and their mates can amuse themselves by throwing bricks at the fire engine. 
-Are you joking?
-I’ve seen it. Only now the firemen don’t arrive so quickly. They know the score.
-What about the parents?
-Don’t know, don’t care. Too frightened to say anything. Maybe some of them think it’s funny.
-That’s what we’re up against.
-On the bright side, it’s a multicultural entertainment, you’ll see the whites and the blacks and the Asian youths all join in the bricking. Girls as well as boys sometimes, though I can´t help thinking that it´s as much about boys showing off as boredom. 
When they returned to the house, David wanted to talk to Mrs James about the area. Matthew and Amy busied themselves with the final preparations for the meal. David positioned himself in the doorway between the hall and the dining room, where he could continue the conversation with Matthew´s mother as she flitted from room to room arranging everything.
-I see what you mean about the cars, he said. Some of the houses have two in the road and one in the garden.
-It’s not too bad in our street, though it’s getting worse. I keep myself to myself more anyway. I worry most about leaving my own car outside. It’s not worth anything and I suppose I could do without it, but I use it for the shops, and when I am looking after Brenda´s little ones. The buses are not so good now, even if they´re free. 
David told her that when they´d knocked on doors or talked to people in the street, immigration had been mentioned as a problem, even by some of the Asian people. 
-I don’t know what to say. Of course it’s a problem. Governments pretend that we welcome people here because we are all enlightened and want to share our good fortune with others, which is all nonsense, but it´s a pretence that makes it harder for right-minded people like you and Matthew to think there could be a problem. The truth is that all my life, immigration has been about bringing in a supply of cheap labour for business; making sure that the supply of labour exceeds the demand. Yes, I understand a little bit about economics. Unemployed people are cheap to feed and they help keep wages low and profits high. The people round here are poor, but they aren’t stupid, they can see what goes on even if they couldn´t explain it to you. 
-I don’t believe they only see it in terms of economics. 
-No; they see life changing around them and they feel threatened by it. People have always felt that way; so it´s always been easy to turn the poor against outsiders who are poor themselves. But the nice people who live in your postcode, and who are so enlightened and tolerant, might have different views if their own kids were going to schools where the teachers have to cope with half the kids in the class not understanding basic English. 
-Don’t you think that’s an exaggeration?
-I don’t have young children so I only go by what people say. There´s Mrs Chaudry next door and her friend Mrs Singh. They´ve lived here for years. Her daughter is very good at maths, Mrs Chaudry’s I mean. She says the girl comes home crying with frustration; complains she´s learning nothing. 
-I don’t know what the answer is David. The new people are here, and that’s that. I can just see there is a problem. I read that multiculturalism was the answer, and I had to ask Matthew to explain what that meant. It seems to be a big word that means different things to different people. If it means that we should have separate communities living in the same place but not having much to do with each other, then it seems to be working here. I hope I´m not shocking you. Maybe I have become a bigoted woman in my old age.
-I doubt it Mrs James. Matthew tells me the young people mix though: that must be a good sign for the future.
-It’s true the parents are more isolated than the kids, by poor language skills, or just bewilderment. The kids feel superior; they’re ashamed of the parents. They turn away from their parents and look for something else. 
-What do they find?
-Just now I call it “how much can I get?” culture. These kids of all colours are sure they´re going to get a lot; one way or another; education or not. It scares me to think how they´ll deal with real life, but I probably shan’t be here to see. That’s a problem for your generation. 
She was carrying a broad plain serving dish that she had just located in the sideboard; wiping it with a tea towel because it hadn´t been used for a while. She paused and looked directly at David as she spoke. 
-Your own problem that you have to sort out is whether, if you have say things you don´t believe, and support things you despise, in order to get power, there´s any point in having it. Are you going to make real changes or only manage things a little more kindly? I don´t believe in souls, but you do; so maybe yours is at risk. There, I´ve delivered my sermon and we´ll say no more about it.
There was a knock at the door. Tim had arrived on time, an unheard of thing.
Mrs James had been appalled to discover that Tim was a near neighbour and they had never invited him round or tried to see him. The boy needed help. If he thought he was being ignored because he was an embarrassment, it would be even harder for him.
Matthew had tried to explain to her that Tim really did not want to see or be seen by anyone. It was the truth. Tim was terrified of pity: he said it was one of the few afflictions not yet visited upon him. Mrs James dismissed such talk as nonsense. She understood as well as anybody that he was going through a hard time, but it was at those times when the people who knew you had to reach out, even when it wasn´t comfortable for them. Was Tim’s pride more important than getting him straight, she asked? 
Reluctantly, Matthew had passed on the invitation to join them at Saturday lunch, and was surprised when Tim accepted. Matthew had been grateful for David´s offer of support on what he supposed would be a difficult day.
Whatever he´d expected, Matthew was shocked when he opened the door for Tim. They´d met only a few days earlier, and Tim was even wearing the same clothes, but that had been in the setting of his own broken down surroundings where he did not seem so out of place. And he had been at ease then; armed with his defiant aggression that challenged anyone to notice the ruin he had become. Today he´d tried to make an effort, to hide if not repair the worst of his condition. The effect was more tragic than if he’d turned up in his normal state. 
He´d attempted to brush the mud from his worn canvas shoes, which were holed and apparently decomposing. Removing the covering of fresh dirt had only exposed the grime underneath. He’d washed his scalp with some cleaning product, but without the battered woollen cap that always covered it; the thin and broken hair was exposed. And in place of the supercilious leer which dared the world to condemn him, now he was attempting a friendly grin. Matthew pulled him inside, where the company was queuing to hug him. 
Brenda arrived not long after, in her little Ford. She nodded greetings to everyone and they went through into the dining room. David was forced to sit at the head of the table and Mrs James installed herself at the far end, though the table was so small they were all close together. There weren´t enough dining chairs to go round, so she perched on a buffet brought in from the kitchen, which she insisted was better as she had to be back and forth to bring the food.
Tim was the only one to have brought some wine, though he said he wouldn’t have any himself. Mrs James did not normally serve drink at Sunday lunch, but she found a corkscrew and some glasses somewhere. Matthew opened the bottle and poured measures for everyone except Tim and Brenda. The wine was drinkable, but barely.
-Are you sure you won’t have a glass too, Timothy. It feels like a proper special occasion now, with wine and everything. 
-No Mrs James, I probably shouldn’t. 
The atmosphere might have been uncomfortable if Mrs James had not been able to hold up both ends of a conversation. She and Amy seemed to be at ease even if the others were tense. Matthew knew that it was not so much that his mother was unaware of the chasms of embarrassment that might open under them at any moment, as that she refused to acknowledge them. 
The food was plain, but there was plenty of it: Mrs James held no culinary pretensions. Everyone was eating and Tim was making a real effort to be pleasant, Matthew started to believe that the occasion might pass without incident. He was only worried about the way Brenda occasionally glared at Tim, as if daring him to step out of line. 
Mrs James complained that David had cajoled her into talking nonsense, on subjects that she knew very little about; though Matthew could see that she’d enjoyed herself. David responded that he´d been put on the rack and told he had to change the world. 
-Isn´t that what you´re supposed to be doing anyway? Matthew asked him.
-I was trying to say that you can only afford to be a little bit in front of the voters, and give people what they are ready for, he explained. Issues can be taken over by the wrong kind of people. It´s not the time to discuss some of them.
-Like nuclear disarmament, employment laws, state control of strategic assets, all that trivial stuff? Matthew asked. Amy gave him a look that reminded him they were supposed to be keeping things calm. 
-The trouble with you Matt is that you are not prepared to take the time to climb the mountain. You only want to see the view from the top. 
-No. I like walking but I´m not interested in climbing mountains; but if that´s what you´re doing, I hope you don’t find yourself standing on the wrong summit when you get to the top. 
Amy told Mrs James that the two of them talked like this all the time. She never knew when they were serious. The meal was going well except that no one liked sprouts and from time to time Brenda would gaze across at Tim with undisguised disgust. Matthew´s mother thought the time was right to draw Tim out a little, now that they were settled down.
-Do you keep up with your languages, Timothy?
-Not really Mrs James.
-Such a shame. You’re so lucky to have a particular talent. I mean Matthew and David are both very clever, but you have a gift for something specific, that’s a bit special. But, I suppose once you have it, it doesn’t leave you. Maybe you´ll take it up again someday. 
-He could use it to get a job, maybe.
-Brenda, that was a bit uncalled for. 
-But some people say he already makes good money, selling drugs to the kids in the park, while he’s claiming the dole at the same time. 
-Brenda, stop it. 
Tim’s expression altered, but he seemed to remain calm. 
-That’s alright Mrs James. People do say that. They’ve said it for so long that the kids do come round to my door expecting to buy stuff. Best advertising I could wish for if I was actually in the business. I could have a regular corner shop going.
-Timothy, don’t you even think about it. 
-Don’t worry Mrs James, I tell them to find their own ways to wreck their lives and leave me out of it. Snot-nosed little brats. Fuck them. 
-Tim.
-Don’t give me that Matthew. I’m an alcoholic heroin addict, I don’t give a shit. Did you think I was going to turn out to be one of those ever so sensitive drug addicts who really cares about everyone else’s feelings deep down? That’s bollocks. They don’t exist. And fuck you too. 
Brenda pushed her chair back from the table. 
-That’s it. I’m going. 
-Don’t go Bren. You’ve got me started finally. It took you a while. You might as well stay to see the rest of the show. 
But Mrs James spoke next, with some determination. 
-There isn’t going to be a show. I hope you don’t think that just because I ‘m an old woman I haven’t heard words like that before. I do own a television set you know. Living round here I hear worse than that from eight year olds. 
-Tim, I’m glad to hear that you´re not dealing in drugs. I never believed that you were. Brenda, if you don´t feel comfortable, maybe it´s best you go now. I´ll see you in the week love. Tim, you´re always welcome here, you know that.
But Tim looked as dejected as a dog that has been kicked. 
-I can’t come here again. You’ve got too much nice stuff. I’d steal the spoons if I needed the cash for … you know.
-You can´t scare me like that love. There´s not much here worth stealing. Matt. Brenda is going without her coat. It’s on the bed upstairs. Get after her. She’s just upset Tim. She’s got three kids you know; that’s why she worries. 
When Matthew returned, the mood was calm again. He had no idea what they had talked about, but it seemed that the women in his life had a knack of dealing with stressful situations. Tim stayed a while longer: when he went home, he thanked them and sounded like he meant it. 
Outside the house, David and Matthew shook hands on parting. The habit was new to them, and Matthew was not sure what it meant; advancing middle age probably. He paused.
-You know, whatever mum said about immigration, I´ve never seen her treat one person different to another. She’s not a racist.
-You don’t have to apologize for her.
-Maybe it’s us.  We grew up when there first started to be blacks and Asians around. There was all that casual racism, remember; the TV comedians and the jokes you heard at school. It was supposed to be harmless, just a bit of fun. We laughed at the time and we´re still feeling guilty about it. It was easier to know where you stood in the seventies, with the National Front idiots around. But now, I see there are real problems, and I don’t trust myself to think about them, even in my own head. I just don´t think about it. 
David shook his head. Same old Matthew; paralysed by self doubt even in his own thoughts. There was nothing you could do with him. As for Tim, there was no point in hoping for much. Sometimes he´d seemed like his old self, especially when he was angry. The rest of the time it was as if he was on medication, struggling to keep up with the conversation. David supposed that his mind would soon be gone if his body did not collapse first.

Chapter Eleven

Amy and Matthew had been together for three years when she told him that the bank had offered her a secondment in Canada, and she was thinking of accepting it. 
-Great, we should go online and start looking for a house.
-It’s only for twelve months Matt, it´s not permanent.
-But then how are we going to manage?
-I was thinking I´d go out there on my own, rent somewhere with space for when you visit. The bank pays for a few trips during the year. I’ll be back before you know. 
Matthew said nothing for a moment. Amy felt as if an invisible liquid presence had entered the room and changed the temperature of the air that separated them.
-How much do you want this love?
Amy decided that the thing in the room was one of those monsters from childhood that grow in power if you admit they are there; so she answered in a bright, straightforward voice.
-More than I thought I would. It’s kind of a big deal at the bank, you understand. It’s like, do this and you´ll be considered for bigger and better things. Turn it down and that´s the ceiling right there.
-That’s not very fair.
-But that’s the way it is. There´s a lot of people they could have offered; and they´d all have jumped at it. Maybe it´s a test of commitment as well. Especially for a woman: they´re convinced we´ll all run off and have babies if the job get´s tough. But anyway, it´s actually something I´d like to do. The only thing that’s stopping me is to know how you feel. 
-I never realized the job meant so much to you.
-Maybe I didn’t realize either. It’s all very sudden. I mean, I honestly didn’t go looking for this; it came to me. But it is a big thing. 
-Okay, well, we can’t be apart for a year, so I’ll give my notice at the paper. Probably a good thing for me to move on anyway. 
-That’s just silly Matt. You’re talking about something that is a big part of your life. It would be like asking you to cut an arm off. I couldn’t let you come with me, knowing that you´d done that. I’d rather not go myself. 
-It´s only a job at a newspaper. You´re what matters in my life.
-But it’s more than a job. 
-How can you know that? We never talk about it.
Amy sighed.
-We talk about more than you realize Matt. We just do it in small ways that you don’t notice. I know that the paper means a lot to you. 
-But then what do we do? I can’t ask you to give up the chance and stay here. You can´t ask me to give up work and come with you.
-It’s only for twelve months. There’s holidays and visits like I said. We can get through it. It will pass before you know. 
-Of course it will. Sorry, I was being unreasonable
But when she’d gone and he was living on his own, Matthew admitted to David how he really felt. 
-I can’t live this way anymore, he said. On my own all the time. Not when Amy and I were so close for so long. 
David told him he sounded like a spoilt kid.
-Look at all the time I´m away. It´s life, unless you want a little woman to follow you around. And don’t talk about the two of you in the past tense, she’s coming back. 
-I feel like she’s never coming back, and that even if she does nothing will be the same. 
-Why shouldn´t it be the same? I wish you could hear yourself. You’d laugh. 
-I know I´m being ridiculous. I can’t explain it, except to say that it´s not just about feeling lonely. It´s that I know that if we were to never see each other again, it wouldn’t mean the same to Amy as it would mean to me
-That’s your old craziness coming out again. I warn you, if it takes proper hold, I´ll have to beat it out of you. When you´re like this you´re no use to Amy or anyone else. You don´t need to plan your personal life three moves in advance, responding to things that aren´t going to happen, unless you make them happen. 
The twelve months passed quickly enough, and Matt flew out to see Amy twice on the bank´s ticket. Afterwards everything seemed to be fine. If Amy noticed any difference in Matthew when she returned, she thought it best not to comment on it. 
But though he tried to pretend that nothing had changed, Matthew was different. He couldn´t even speak to Amy about it: it was David who heard his confession.
-I thought about her all the time she was away, every day, until eventually I knew what the problem was. There´s nothing in me to inspire the kind of feeling that Amy says she has for me. Either she´s mistaken about her feelings, or else her feelings have nothing to do with me as I really am. I’m nothing special, you know that. I´m in a trap. I have to believe either that she’s in love with the feeling of being in love for its own sake, or else that she sees more in me than there really is. Either way I´m living a lie. One day she’ll see me for who I am and that will be the end.
-Why should Amy trick herself into caring about you?
-But that´s what she´s done. And you have to understand. I love her. She deserves the best there is. I don’t want her to be tricked into falling in love with someone, even if it’s me
-You need professional help my friend. You should fall on your knees and give thanks that this girl loves a moron like you; which she clearly does; not waste your time wondering why. What gives you the right to think that you know what she´s thinking better than she does? That takes a special kind of arrogance, Matthew. You say I manipulate people, but you’ve gone beyond me: you’re ready to tell them that what they believe they´re thinking is not what is in their minds at all. 
-Be serious.
-I’m being deadly serious Matt. And one more thing. I know you will think this comes from a closet catholic, so you won’t like to hear it, but it’s true anyway. If you walk around feeling that you have to deserve your happiness, or else it can’t be genuine, then you’ll never be happy. Ever. I shouldn’t put it this way for you, but it’s a question of grace. Grace that is bestowed on you when good things come your way and grace that you must find accept them. If we only received what we had deserved, the world would be in flames.
Matthew refused to be persuaded. He´d got an idea in his head that he clung onto stubbornly even if it threatened to annihilate him. Amy could see clearly that he was in pain, but there was nothing she could do to get him to talk it through. They were caught by the notion they had always shared, that true feelings could only bloom in the dark secret places of the heart. If you exposed them to sunlight and prodded them about, you were left with a handful of dead petals. Even so, Amy had her direct way of speaking.
-I feel as if we’ve spoiled something, and we might never get it back, she told him. I wish I’d never seen Toronto. 
-You had to go love, and you’ve not spoiled anything. I just have some stupid, pointless feelings that I have to work through. Everything will be alright, it will pass. It’s just taking me a while, and that’s my own fault. There’s no reason to spoil your time brooding over it.
-Maybe we should do something about it instead of talking. We could get married.
-You were the one who said no to that. 
-I remember
-So why would you suggest it now?
-Does it matter? Do I have to be able to explain it?
-I don’t know. It’s a nice thought, but now isn´t the time. We should talk about it later. 
In fact it was already too late. Amy´s next overseas trip was only a three months posting, barely more than an extended business trip; but when she returned from Mexico, Matthew told her that he´d met someone else and that it was over for them. 

***

Amy had known that something was badly wrong from the moment they held each other in the arrivals hall of the airport, but to hear from his own mouth that Matthew had been with another woman sent a wave crashing over Amy´s life that demolished the defences she´d been able to put up against hearing bad news and destroyed everything. She didn’t scream or cry and she stayed polite; a little too polite. The screaming and wailing was going on inside; where some small but precious part of her was twisting up and blackening, dying a horrible private death. 
-Someone younger and prettier, I suppose.
-No: she’s closer to my own age, seven years older than you. She’s got a kid.
-Is that supposed to make me feel better?
-The boy´s handicapped. He’s twelve I think, but he seems younger..
-What is wrong with him?
-I don’t know what they call it. He needs a lot of help though. It’s hard on Jane. 
-Do you think you´ll be able to provide... Jane, with the help she needs?
-I haven’t really thought about it
-Well you need to. 
-Amy, this is really uncomfortable for us both. I know you don’t want to talk about someone else’s family just now. 
-You’ve been through this kind of thing before. I expect you know how it works.
-Yes I’ve split up with girls before, and you’ve never reproached me about it or asked me anything about them, and I´ve always been grateful for that. But this situation is different anyway. This is a situation I never, ever wanted to happen.
-It seems that you´re the one who is making it happen.
-Because it just has to be this way. What can I say? I spent so many years not wanting to be responsible for anything or anyone and then I met you. You’re perfect. You’ve been everything to me. You are everything to me still, except that I could never believe you needed me, as much as I need you. If I died tomorrow, you’d be sad, but you’d cope. Life would go on. I admire that about you Amy, I really do; your self-possession is beautiful: and you never ask for anything for yourself. But you woke something in me that I didn’t think I had; some hunger, but it’s more than that, to be needed, not just wanted. And now I have that hunger, I can’t shake it off. 
-What you´ve just said is so full of crap that I can´t even begin to answer you. I suppose you think that Jane needs you more than I do?
-I believe she does.
-I hope you know it. You need to do more than believe. God help you if you don’t. You’re a person who can change what he believes overnight. I know how weak you can be Matthew. It never changed how I felt about you. I know that you think that because I don’t talk about what passes between us, it means I don’t understand. You feel unworthy of what we have, in some stupid part of you that I can’t get through to. If I could talk to you about it I would, but there are some things you can’t talk about without causing damage. Once you´ve spoken, it’s already too late.
-Don’t be angry
-I’m not angry. I’m sad. You‘ve hurt me with what you´re doing and more with how you are doing it. I know that men sometimes sleep with other women to escape from the relationship they´re in, but you didn’t need to do that to us. You could have just told me how you felt. And if I thought that you had only started to see this woman as a way to get away from me, and that you didn’t even love her; if  I heard afterwards that you´d run away, after letting her believe that you would be there for her and her poor son; then I would begin to hate you. I’m sorry to have to use that word. 
Matthew knew that if Amy had fought against him, if she’d refused to accept that it was over between them, or even if she’d only broken down in front of him; there would have been no way for him to walk out. He didn’t have that much strength. But she was too proud and in any case, the damage was done. Amy shed the rest of her tears in private. Within a week she´d found somewhere temporary to stay and moved her things out, but that night Matthew left her in the flat, not knowing where he should go. Oakland Ridge seemed like the only place.

***

David was telling a story to Evelyn and didn´t hear Matthew arriving downstairs.
The boy and the faery princess met by chance as the princess was riding out in the woods near her faery palace, on her favourite white pony. The boy and the princess fell in love the moment they saw each other. The princess was enchanted by the gentle brown eyes of the farm boy and the noble spirit that she sensed under his rough appearance. The boy knew that the princess was the most delicate and magical creature he would ever see.
He agreed to steal her away from the faery castle, but on the night they planned to escape they were seen by the palace guards. In the struggle, the boy accidentally killed the captain of the guard. He was brought before the faery King in chains of silver. 
The sentence of the King was that the boy should be hung for his crime, but when the faery princess heard this she cried so much that her father offered the only compromise that their law allowed. If the princess agreed, he would decree that the boy should be imprisoned in the palace for twenty-one years and a day, and for that time the princess would be banished from the palace and live among the mortals outside the walls. Only once a year, on the anniversary of their crime, would she be able to visit the boy at the faery palace.
The princess agreed, and once a year she came back to the palace, bringing news of the boy’s family, and all the things that were changing in the wide world. There the princess met other handsome boys, but she stayed true to her farm boy, even when men who had heard of her beauty came from far and wide to woo her. 
The years passed at the palace. At first the boy was alone in the dungeon, but in time the King became a regular visitor to his cell. The King missed his daughter so badly, and the boy was the only person he could talk to about her. Eventually the boy and the King became friends, joined by their shared love of the princess, and they would ride out to hunt together in the cold morning air of the forest, but the boy had to be back at the palace before sunset or the penance would be broken. 
More years passed, and the boy became a man, and though he remained human, he had learned the ways of faery. He was happy to stay within the walls of the castle. He had his own horses, hunting birds and hounds, and he had the free use of the palace library that was full of interesting books, that no-one else in the palace bothered with, because faeries are extremely negligent regarding knowledge. But of course he still longed for the day when he would be released from his sentence and free at last to start his life with the beautiful princess who was waiting for him in the cottage in the wood, on the other side of the palace walls. 
Eventually the day came, twenty-one years and a day after his crime, and the princess came to see him at the castle, as she had in all the other years, her heart full of excitement because at last they would be together. 
The boy was now a prince of faery himself, and as handsome a prince as any could remember (because the years of the faery palace were different to human years, so that he had barely aged). But when he looked at his princess, he saw for the first time how much the years had changed her. She was no longer slender and delicate, but plump and human looking. The years of living in waiting had made her bad tempered, and she was impatient with his faery manner of speaking, which was in no ways plain and to the point, because at the palace it was more important to express things in a correct and pleasing manner than to explain clearly what you had to say. 
The prince could still remember the deep feelings that he had held for the beautiful princess, and he knew that the dowdy woman who stood before him was that same person he had held in his heart for so long. He tried to control his emotions, reminding himself that he had loved her so much, and telling himself that he must still do, even though she now seemed to him only human and ordinary. When he thought back over their meetings, once a year since his imprisonment, he could not remember when she had begun to change, or when his love for the princess had begun to fade.
The faery King came to meet them in the drawing room of the palace, eager to see his missing daughter again, and to discuss plans for the wedding. He seemed not to notice the effects of time as he embraced his daughter with great love. But the prince announced that he had bad news. He was very sorry, but he no longer felt the same way about the princess. They had grown in different ways while they were apart, he said, and now there was a gulf between them that could not be crossed. He suggested that it would be better if they both carried on their separate lives, rather than spoiling the memory of what they had enjoyed. He was sure that the princess would see it that way too, in time. His own life was now at the palace.
In the next moment, as the room began to spin away from the prince, he could see the faery King, still embracing his daughter, but now she was again the young princess he had first loved, impossibly slender and beautiful. The next thing he knew, he was back in his old cottage in the woods, lying on the floor of earth, in his rough clothes: but something was different. He felt his face and looked at his hands. He had become older. Twenty-one years had passed. And he was alone.
-David, dinner’s ready, what are you doing?
Patricia came into the room with her arms folded. He thought she looked tired. She was wearing an old sweater and the leggings that he hated. He dimmed the light and whispered.
-I was just finishing Evelyn´s bedtime story
-She’s too young for your stories.
-She likes the sound of them. Children´s stories last for years. I´m making them for Evelyn now so that she´ll grow into them later, when she can understand better.
-Matthew´s here. He´s in a bad way. Something´s happened between him and Amy.
Evelyn had already fallen asleep. David switched on the audio monitor and they went downstairs to dinner.

***

Weeks after the final words with Amy, Matthew was still feeling alternately raw and numb. He´d agreed with Jane that they should have some time apart. He was no use to anyone in this condition. Matthew was not sure that he even wanted to see Jane any more. His thoughts were taken up with his own grief; and it seemed to want to turn to bitterness.
Matthew spent a few nights at the Thomas´s. Later, he was there so much of the time that he may as well have moved in. He was drinking too much again. Most nights, David shared a glass with him, but David didn´t seem to be affected by alcohol like other people. It was a time when David didn´t need to be in London, and Matthew was glad. He didn´t want to be alone with Patricia.
David seemed to have something on his mind. Matthew waited to hear it.  Soon David asked him what he thought of a certain town councillor
-Joe Reilly? He’s alright I suppose, not the sharpest tool in the box, but seems honest enough. Not something you can take for granted, believe me. He’s been a fixture on the planning committee for as long as anyone can remember.
-That´s what I mean. Decent enough, but chairman of the planning committee?
-Someone has to do the job. It might as well be him as anyone else.
-It’s a very powerful role Matt.
Matthew paused to consider this.
-What are you thinking of doing?
-The local men don’t like me. They don’t trust me because I owe them nothing. And that damages me. I need people I can rely on in my own home patch. 
-I hope you’re not asking me to stand for the council because there is absolutely no chance of that.
-Relax; I already have someone on the council. 
-What Harold, are you serious?
-He’s served for nearly two years.
-Only because you forced him on them. And Joe’s served for more than twenty years. 
-Exactly, it’s time for some new blood.
-You’d never get the old guard to agree with you.
-Not if I went about it as you would like me to; granted. If I go to them, state my case and ask for a general session to debate the position. But that’s not how things are done. They´re a feuding bunch down there; always falling out with each other about who´s been overlooked or found their way blocked. You know how it is; just a question of seeing how the fault lines lay and knowing how to use them. Why are you looking at me like that?
-I thought you were elected to fight the Tories, not your own people.
-That’s right, but I can´t do that effectively while I’m being held back at every turn by people who think they should run everything just because they´ve been around forever. 
Matthew made no reply to this. He felt at a disadvantage, in his friend´s house, enjoying his whisky. He was presuming on David´s hospitality and he knew that he was not good company at the moment.
-Why tell me about it?
-You report council meetings and doings all the time. You could…
-No.
-I respect your moral scruples, Matt. I wouldn’t be asking you…
-Good, nothing more to say then.
Matthew was annoyed with himself. David had asked him to do something that was wrong and he was the one feeling wretched because he had refused.
Two weeks later, outside the Council chamber, Matthew bumped into Joe Reilly, leaving a committee meeting in a hurry. There had been no public announcement, but a rumour was going round that Joe would be stepping down at the coming local elections. 
-Evening Joe.
-Mr Reilly to you
-What’s up with you?
-You know very well what’s up. Your smarmy pal has fixed things up to get rid of me. Do you think I was born yesterday?
-I don’t know much about it Joe. I mean…sorry. There was some gossip about you retiring, but I didn’t believe it.
-You wouldn’t credit it. Twenty three years on the council and this is how they chuck me out.
-I’m sorry, really. Still you know, twenty three years; it’s a good innings. I mean, no one can go on forever. The places are not owned
-No, but your Mr Thomas owns that pimpled little shit who is going to take my place doesn’t he? If that’s the way it’s going to be, I tell you I’m glad to be out.
Harold followed Joe out of the chamber just as this exchange was ending. He was straightening the bundle of papers that he carried. His expression was smug. Reilly turned his back and strode off down the corridor. For once, Matthew could not restrain himself and turned on Harold. 
-Are you satisfied with what you’ve got? Was it worth what you had to do to get it?
-Councillor Reilly has understood that he wouldn´t have the support to hold on to his seat. Better for everybody that he retires gracefully. I’m happy for now, thank you. 
-Harold grinned at him. The grin naturally curled into a sneer.
-Do you really think that you can make good happen by behaving in this way? Matthew asked him. 
-You poor tender hearted thing, Harold replied. Last year we stopped two local schools from being shut down. We got a commitment of funds from government to put a new specialist wing on the city hospital. We’ve got transport and housing schemes going through that will change people’s lives. Of course we can’t make a big fuss about any of it, or else the press; that’s you; will accuse us of socialism. But none of this would have happened without your friend David or without people like me. So yes, thank you very much for your concern; I can sleep well at nights. What have you done for anybody but yourself lately?
-I just don’t see the point of what you do Harold. You think so little of people that you can trample on them, but you tell yourself you are doing it to make them happy. How can that work?
-And I’m glad you don’t understand. I’m not like you: drifting uselessly through life. I got everything I wanted because I planned it from the start – school, college, this job. Everything as I planned, because I took control and made it happen. 
-And now you’ve got all you want?
-It’s coming to me.
-Then why do you never look happy Harold? I‘ve never seen you with a genuine happy smile.
-Thanks for that, coming from you Mr Jolly. Harold walked away.
Few tears were shed for Joe Reilly. Many of the council and party members remembered how Joe had made himself chairman of the planning committee in the first place: those who didn´t were subtly reminded. There had to be a dinner to thank him for his many years of service and to wish him well in retirement. As a local MP it was natural that David should make the presentation. Nothing was said publicly, but it did not escape anyone’s attention that the old man who had been stabbed in the back now had to shake the hand that had held the dagger. To see this happen to Joe; the roughest and meanest of all of them, was frightening. Joe Stalin they used to call him. Even he had not seen it coming. If it could happen to him, it could happen to any of them. Perhaps after all, it would be better to work with the new lot rather than against them. At the end of the day, weren’t they all trying to pull in the same direction? And you had to admit, that David Thomas had a certain style about him.

Chapter Twelve

Somewhere in Africa, there was a war going on. It was the normal state of things.
The escort took Hawkins to a compound of single storey buildings that looked as if they had been government offices in the days when there had last been a government. The glare of the West African sun was at its most pitiless. They all climbed out of the jeeps. The men were smiling, in good humour; but Hawkins took no comfort in that. They were men who could laugh as they slit throats, and this was not a happy time. 
A pair of field guns had been placed in the centre of the compound, and the soldiers were directing them against some unidentified target in the centre of town. Hawkins looked to the faraway high rise towers of what had been a modern city, all steel and glass; probably with most of the glass lying in shards by now. 
The gun crews applied themselves to the task as they would have approached any other job in this heat: they would fire a few rounds, laughing at the deafening explosions of the guns; then they would become bored or tired and sit around talking for a while, resuming when the conversation wore out. His escort seemed to find the artillery hugely entertaining. They were grinning and applauding the gunners. But the lieutenant had his orders and they moved on.
Further on, some of the child soldiers that you saw everywhere in this conflict were resting in a group. They seemed to be mostly asleep, which seemed incredible given the noise of the guns, but Hawkins knew they were probably coming down from the adrenaline of last night´s action and whatever drugs they had been given to prepare them for it. They looked like boys of ten or eleven, though they could have been older, holding weapons as big as they were. He was careful to keep as far from them as possible. Even without drugs they were unpredictable, comical looking but lethal. Automatic weapons were their toys, and the nearest thing they had to a daddy was the Big Man, even if most of them had been orphaned by his troops. They were fanatically loyal to him, convinced that he could not be killed by bullets, but that anyone else who crossed their path very definitely could be.
Even the crazy white man had not been able to wound the Big Man. The child soldiers dreamed of a time when they would share the Big Man’s secret of invulnerability to bullets, but they knew that only the best of them would ever achieve this. 
Albert had been locked up in one of the smaller outbuildings at the far side of the compound, that might have once been the caretaker’s office and store.
The teenage lieutenant led Hawkins to the door of Albert’s cell. There were two heavily armed guards outside, who made a reasonable job of saluting the boy and opened the door for Hawkins to enter. The lieutenant made as if to follow, but Hawkins stopped him, patting the holstered pistol on his own belt and smiling. The young man frowned; then shrugged his shoulders. Hawkins went in alone. 
There was a single room, with no windows. The only light came from the holes in the roof, where it had decayed and given way. The hot air was suffocating. 
Something that could have been either a man or a bundle of discarded clothes was lying completely motionless in the darkest corner. 
-Do you have any water?
-You’re alive
-Only for the moment I suppose
-I’ve a little here, take it.
Albert stirred himself to drink, and wipe some of the blood away from his face with a dampened sleeve. The light caught his face. Hawkins winced.
-Jesus Christ, what a mess. Long time no see. What were you thinking of Albert?
-Someone once told me, there’s a line you can’t cross because if you do, anything can happen. Best advice I never took.
-You crossed a line for sure.
-What is the Big Man saying? Did the boys get anywhere near him?
-What do you think; seriously? There´s not a scratch on him. I think he’s in a good mood today. He’s been spinning all these tales about how he can’t be killed and now your team comes along and makes it look as if it might be true, even when the treacherous white men turn on him. I suppose if he had even had a small wound, every white within reach would have been slaughtered by now. It could still happen. Did you stop to consider that? Anyway, give me the story, you may as well.
Albert had been out of the country for months and Hawkins had not seen or heard from him. It turned out that he´d come back only make a personal delivery of some new toys for the Big Man’s army. He´d intended to make a few calls on contacts, and leave as soon as was decent. Then somehow he´d become involved in a desperate attempt to overthrow the regime (if the Big Man’s rule could be called a regime). Two nights earlier, a few well equipped men, veterans of the endless wars of the place, had climbed the walls of the Presidential residence and killed most of the guards before the Big Man was roused. He´d led the counter attack personally with his elite bodyguard. In a few minutes the attackers were captured or, if they were lucky, killed. 
-What were you thinking of?
-It’s worked before in this country. 
-Not against the likes of him. Would you hope to catch the devil off guard? Jesus Christ.
-What about the boys?
-All dead now, fortunately for them. 
-They were dead anyway, before it began. He´d decided to take out their village – decided he couldn’t trust it not to turn against him. He’s insane, you know. Fifteen hundred men, women and children in that village, probably more. One of the ministers told me about it. I expect he’s dead too, but you mustn’t ask me to tell you his name. He was a man from the same village, introduced them to me. Knew I could get the equipment for an operation. We persuaded ourselves that if the worst came to the worst, maybe the stuff wouldn’t be missed from a big shipment.
-Jesus Christ, Albert.
-Are you going to keep saying that? If so I shall have to ask you to leave. Tell me what the deal is.
-You know how it works. We’re all under suspicion now, but fortunately we’re still useful. I’ve been brought here to finish you off. Prove my loyalty I suppose. 
-No way out of it.
-I can’t see one Albert. You know my views on such things. If was you or me, then would be you. But it’s worse than that in this case; it’s just you; or you and me both.
-I understand Ray.
-I wish I did.
-I couldn’t watch it happen any more. That was my mistake; coming back. And I was stupid enough to think I could make a difference. I overestimated our importance. But they were good, honest men Ray, they deserved a chance. 
-I don’t know how you can possibly think that you know what kind of men they were, or what kind of men they would have become in this place. Supposing it had come off, one of your mates would take over and become just as bad as this bastard in a month.
-I thought if they could make the change, quickly and cleanly, without too much bloodshed…
-Well you’re right when you say that you overestimated our importance. What matters for these men is the will: we only provide the means. I used to think that it was us who gave them power; but I know better now. The truth is they are stronger than us. They have pure intentions in the way that animals do. They’ve turned a bunch of kids too small to hold their guns right into the most lethal weapon in this war. Men like these will take out whole villages armed with nothing more than a few sharp blades. We’ve both seen them do it, in the Congo. 
-Those blades were imported machetes that arrived in crates stamped to say they were agricultural implements. Whoever was selling them knew what they were for: enough machetes for every farmer south of the Sahara to have two.
-My point is; we think it’s our doing, but it’s not. 
-We tell ourselves that Ray, but we make things worse, when we should be making them better. We keep filling their treasuries with aid dollars, so there´s more for the gangsters to fight over; and then we give them bigger and more deadly toys so that the few can keep the many down. How does that help?
-If you felt like that you should have stayed at home. Why did you imagine that your meddling would be more helpful than anybody else’s?
-Let’s talk about something else Ray, I’m tired.
 -Your mouth is bleeding pretty badly.
-It’s only teeth knocked out. I guess I shan’t need them now. Tell me about England. Did you manage to sort out that little problem about the Cromwell takeover?
-Sweet as a nut. It seems like an age ago now. The other party could see how the land lay fairly smartish. He was only up for the money. Seemed like a lot of trouble for nothing to me though. It was just one of your front companies wasn’t it? Easier to let it go and find another. 
-It mattered a great deal to a friend of mine.
-Your protégé. The one you told me about. I talked to him; seemed grateful. But that sort of thinking is what I call romantic, Albert. I might even say there’s a direct line between thinking like that, and the situation you find yourself in now. Too much reading and thinking has brought you to this.
-Reading stimulates the imagination Ray. Without imagination we are animals and nothing more. But you´re right of course: I´ve been reading too much and the same few books. There are two of them with my things. You might try them. They look like heavy going but I know you´re not as dumb as you try to make out.
-You want to talk about books just now?
-There´s a Russian one, but it´s an English translation, called Crime and Punishment; and another called Nostromo
-Funny name. What are they about?
-The first is about a young student who persuades himself to murder so he´ll be able to do great things for mankind, but then he has to live with the consequences. The second is more complicated; it´s to do with personal integrity, and then it has things to say about whether you can be involved in the business of empire and still be an honest man.
-Thanks, but they don´t sound like anything in my line.
-Well then, maybe if you find your way back to England you could return them to that friend of mine. In a way they are part of his story.
-How does the second one turn out?
-It´s not conclusive. But in the end, the material interests always extract what they demand in the name of progress. My Charles Gould will go to hell defending his silver mine.
-I have no idea what you’re talking about.
-I´m raving probably. I´m beyond everything now. One final thing, I wanted to tell you that I´ve discovered the secret of the English abroad: they´re capable of finding a practical way through every difficulty, by blocking every perception of disagreeable consequences that may follow from pursuing their own self-interest. Deciding not to think about something, is a faculty they have evolved to the point where it defines them. At the end of all, the Englishman sees that he has endured, and concludes that this means that his behaviour was right and proper.
-Well that´s my own philosophy Albert, in a nutshell; and summed up very prettily. I wish we could sit and chat for longer; I really do. By the way, you never did tell me your real name. In case there’s anybody I should tell.
-There’s no one to tell. I´d prefer to be allowed to disappear into Africa.
A memory brightened Ray´s expression.
-Someone else used to say that. Andrei, do you remember him? We were with him in Addis Ababa that time. He said that once you spent time in Africa you could never really leave. Mind you he hated the cold. Came from Siberia you know, one of those oil towns that is cut off half the year. Studied languages so hard, just to get away.
-I remember. What´s he doing now?
-He´s got a big ranch somewhere near Port Elizabeth. Never went home. He did all right when that Soviet thing finished, I don´t know the details. Said he didn´t want to move to Cyprus or anywhere else that´s lousy with other rich Russian thieves.
Albert sighed.
-How is it you always know so much about people, Ray?
-People interest me. It´s books and ideas for you, people for me.
They fell silent for a moment. Albert shifted painfully, attempting to support his weight more easily. 
-You know, after the American Civil War, the slaves who were freed, were allowed to come to Africa. They were helped to come. The place they settled, they called Liberia; from the word liberty I suppose. What do you suppose they did as soon as they got here?
-I don’t know
-They enslaved the first black men they saw and set them to building plantations and southern style mansions so that they could walk around in frock coats and play the master.
-And does that tell us something about blacks?
-No. Only about human nature in general. It’s not enough for humans to have all they need. They have to deprive and brutalize others to feel really good about themselves. 
-You know, I think it is time for me to be done with all this. I hurt just about everywhere. We might as well get on with it.
A few minutes later, the escort heard the muffled noise of a single shot being fired behind the locked door, barely audible above the noise of the cannon. The big white man emerged looking not very friendly. The lieutenant judged that the work was done and ordered his men back to the jeep. He stepped inside himself briefly, just to check. He argued briefly with the artillery officer over what should be done with the body. Neither of them wanted to take responsibility for dumping it, in case the Big Man should ask to see it afterwards, so in the end they simply put the lock back on the door. 
The big white man was very quiet on the way back to the Presidential residence, in a way that made the men in the jeep watchful, but the lieutenant supposed that he and the other white men would have learned their lesson, that here they were only men, and death could come to white and black, just the same. 

Chapter Thirteen

His private life was in such turmoil that Matthew hardly noticed when the shareholders of Cromwell voted to accept an offer to acquire all shares from a mysterious bidder called Pelican Global. It was not a business that anyone had ever heard of, but it did seem to have almost limitless acquisition funds available. 
The takeover would mean that the link between David and the company would finally be broken. Even if he had not been so distracted by politics, there would not have been much that he could do about it. He still had shares, but these days he could be outvoted. In any case, the reality was that now that he was a member of parliament, David had moved on to another stage of his life. There was all the excitement and ceremony of his first term at Westminster: a new game with complicated rules to be learned. There was the feeling that he was going to be part of a tide of change that had just begun to swell before sweeping over all that needed to be washed away.
David might have other concerns, but Matthew had to inform his readers about the new owners of the works and what plans they had for the future.
Matthew found the offices of Cromwell Industries much changed since he was last there, though the plant itself looked no different. In the offices, there were more people, more workstations, more phones, more glass. An elegant assistant informed him that Mr Pearson would be with him presently, when he finished talking with head office. 
Eventually he was shown into the executive suite and introduced to Dan Pearson, a tall man, quite lean, with a strong jaw and a broad smile. They shook hands
-I’m very grateful to you for making the time to see me Mr Pearson. I appreciate you are very busy.
-It’s we who are grateful to you Matthew. Local connections are key to our success. We are very conscious that we engage in a partnership with our communities. We want to play our part. I’m sure this profile will help.
-Well, thank you. You should know, I don’t normally work on the business pages, but there is a lot of local interest right now. I suppose we’ll mostly use the handout that your assistant provided for our piece, it’s very…
-Comprehensive.
-I was going to say, on message, but yes. Anyway, just one or two questions to flesh things out.
-Fire away
-Thank you again. Maybe a little human interest, to give a background if you don’t-object? You’re English I believe?
-That´s correct. We have a place in Surrey. That’s where my children go to school. 
-So England is home to you?
-Well, as you know, Pelican is a global business, so work takes me pretty much everywhere, but it is good to have the chance to spend a year or two working in the UK, yes.
-And could you explain exactly what it is that Pelican does? I’m sorry, as I say I’m not really a business journalist. Maybe you could tell me in words that our general readers will understand. You’re not just an engineering company?
-Good lord no. That´s a good question though, Matt. As it says in our handout, we specialize in leveraging assets to maximise shareholder return, but I guess that sounds like jargon to you. So no, we are not an engineering company in the sense that you mean. We like to think that we engineer efficiencies.
-And how does that work?
-Well, in effect, we buy companies where we can see that there is a good opportunity to improve them, to boost their value by making them more efficient. We realize those efficiencies and then we return those companies to the market.
-And, if you can say, do you think that, in local terms, that process is likely to mean fewer jobs. You know that has particular interest for our readers. I understand you already own a plant similar to this one in the Far East.
-Malaysia actually, but that really is a different business to Cromwell. This is a business with a very high skill base. If I had to guess, I’d say that we would probably hope to recruit more people in this area over the next few years. The current medium term forecasts for demand look very promising. Of course you know I can’t say too much – can’t risk giving you information that might be market sensitive. And naturally, we always remain responsive to market conditions. 
-That’s reassuring, I think. Could you tell me though, are there any plans to invest in replacement plant? Some people have told me that the production line here is not as up to date as it should be.
-That is another interesting point Matt, but you know typically, at Pelican, we don’t so much look to change the long term infrastructure of our acquisitions; though that’s not to say it couldn’t happen if we found a business need. The capital structure of our business is more geared towards acquisition, improvement and then passing on to a long term holder of the asset. Normally we’d be invested for, say, two to three years at most; and you might not see a return on new plant in that time.
-So in effect, you borrow the money to buy the company, service the debt from its revenues and then sell it on for a higher price?
-There’s more to it than that. I wish it were that simple: but at a very basic level, yes. 
-Thanks Mr Pearson, I’m sure it’s all in the handout but you are making things much clearer for me
-No problem
-So finally, and thanks again for your time, you mentioned market conditions earlier
-Yes
-How do you see those conditions affecting the business in the future? I mean, could you tell us what factors might affect your decisions?
-You’ll find that summarised in our annual report, but in the end, the market decides for us all
-And how do you know when the market has decided?
-Finally, for us, it’s about the shareholder value. Like any company, our duty is to get the best deal for our shareholders
-Interesting; so that’s the only rule, ultimately
-That’s the way things are. It’s always been that way in business.
-Thanks Mr Pearson, you’ve been very generous with your time. I’m grateful to you for explaining things to me so clearly.
-No problem. If you think of anything else you need later, give me a call. 
Matthew went back to the office and told the business reporter, an earnest boy who always wore a suit to work, to print a simplified version of the Pelican handout with a short introduction in the English language. He left the boy to pen it, saying that he had to give some bad news to an old friend. If I have to bet, the factory will be closed within the year, he thought. 
Later that day, Pearson met with his finance director and human resources chief to discuss the plans for shutting down Cromwell and moving the contracts to Malaysia. 
-I have to say it’s not a bad little business, Finance was saying. Better than we´d expected. 
-We’ll run it to the end of the year. That’s a decent interval and long enough to discover that the market has moved against our forecast. Changing international economy, sharp downturn in our expectations. Usual stuff. If it gets rough we can hint at years of under investment by previous ownership, but not too heavy with that. What do the closedown costs look like?
-It’s the UK Dan; it’s not like France or Germany. A lot of the workforce has been here a long time, which pushes up their entitlements a little, but still peanuts, comparatively. 
Human Resources sounded like he wanted to get started on the severances right away, but Finance had a query. 
-Are you certain we need to play it this way?
Pearson looked disgusted.
-Ron, are you with me or against me here? You know as well as I do that I’m six months into a two year rotation here as top guy here in Europe. If things go well, I am looking at main board, Asia Pacific region after that. And the two of you will be with me all the way, I hope. We need to shift some assets and do it now. You’ve seen the numbers: if we start developing this business now it will soak up cost. We’re looking at seventeen to twenty-three months to see the improvement on the base case. We might struggle to make our bonus numbers. And what will the situation be in two years? Correct: you and I will have moved on and someone else will take the credit. Both of us know Ron, that in the real world, that isn´t going to happen.

David was on the television again. This time it was the regional news magazine. The outside broadcast consisted of a few junior reporters being filmed outside the barracks of the various Yorkshire based regiments, trying not to look miserable in the rain as they speculated on what mobilisation might mean for the troops and their families. Next, the scene shifted to the studio, where David and the senior presenter were seated in front of a monitor watching the end of the last item. 
- And after that summary, here to discuss the situation we have local MP David Thomas, good evening. David, you´re respected in Westminster for your views on international affairs. You´ve been tipped as a future foreign office minister. I think you were also a lawyer before entering politics. What response do you have for the growing numbers of people in our region who argue that it would be illegal as well as wrong for Britain to join the United States in military action in Iraq?
On the screen, it hardly seemed like David: he looked older and heavier; a figure of authority. With his dark suit and his practised gestures, he seemed almost presidential. 
-Can I say firstly, no one feels more than I the gravity of a potential use of military force. Clearly the government must consider situations like the present crisis very carefully, taking on board all sides of the argument.  But in the end, it is the fundamental responsibility of the government of this country to safeguard the security of its people. Having considered what we know, and unfortunately not all of that information can be made public for very good reasons; our judgement, is that there is a threat to the United Kingdom that is present and real. In that circumstance, this government has to be prepared to take action with our American allies.
David´s voice was sombre to the point of exaggeration, like a disappointed parent lecturing a naughty child. Now the interviewer was speaking again. 
-Mr Thomas, you’ve spoken from time to time about your faith, and how it’s made you stronger in politics. If there is a war there will be innocent victims. Tell us, how do you reconcile your belief with being prepared to see innocent people bombed?
David was leaning forward, on the edge of his seat, to hear the question, nodding his understanding of the difficulty. He frowned and his hands came together for a moment, as if in prayer. Then he sat back in the chair to deliver his considered response. 
-I can´t pretend that is an easy question, and the first thing to say is that we all hope there won’t be a war. We´re confronting an evil dictator, who has killed many thousands of his own people, but even now we are prepared to work with him for a peaceful solution. If a conflict is forced on us, then we have to make every effort to minimise the effect on civilian populations; but we have to be honest; there are bound to be some tragedies. It comes to this, in my judgement; we have to ask ourselves whether those tragedies outweighed the good that we can do, by our intervention, for the people of Iraq, and for our own people. 
Matthew didn´t want to see any more, but he couldn´t bring himself to switch off. It wasn´t that it was David: he´d learned by now to separate his friend from the image he read about or saw on the screen. But how could any of them talk like this? It was the same story as the Falklands War and the war after that. He was only waiting for one of them to say, it´s all bollocks: Tony can tell that cowboy in the White House to get on with it on his own if he wants. Wouldn´t that be what David liked to call leadership? 
But it wouldn´t happen, and in his heart Matthew knew why only a few marginal figures would have the nerve for that. It was a lack of confidence that went back to the Michael Foot years and the ghosts of ninety three: it was the safety blanket of party discipline, and the secret fear of being found out, after pretending to be the same as the Tories to get power. Now they were all terrified of being caught showing progressive sympathies. It went back even further than past political disappointments. It was what he´d told David years ago about a generation of ex-grammar school boys becoming more conformist than their predecessors; only trying to fit in and be taken seriously. 
But some of the arguments about this war were even too childish for schoolboys. Don’t argue with the big boy. We know he’s a bully, but maybe we can stop him doing anything too beastly if we play along with him. 
Matthew had listened to David telling him privately that the Americans were going to attack Iraq whatever anyone thought about it. Some country had to pay for terrorist acts committed on their own soil, but all the perpetrators came from countries that were allies. Iraq was the best available target for vengeance, and since the American public remembered Sadaam as a cartoon villain from the time of the first desert war, the administration had an easy job with public opinion. All that the Foreign Office could hope for was to give what was going to happen some appearance of legitimacy. The same man who´d told him this was now on television stoking the fires and talking about balancing the greater good. 
Matthew was trying to write an editorial on his laptop. The subject seemed meaningless just now. He put his head in his hands for a moment, wondering what he could write about such a situation even if he could get it printed. It seemed a case of four legs good, two legs better; and already too late to see which was pig and which was man. 

***

Two days later, when David left the house in the morning and went to his car, he was surprised to notice a tarpaulin of heavy plastic sheeting pitched just outside his gate, on the grassy expanse between the high garden wall and the road. Someone had put up a makeshift tent. A handful of people were standing around it. When they saw him they began chanting. He didn’t stop to listen to the words. He got in the car and was about to drive on, but seeing one of the figures made him pause. He was sure that was Tim standing with them. He had to go and check. 
Tim greeted him brightly.
-Hi David. Nice morning for a demo; could be warmer; never mind. 
-What are you doing?
-It’s not what I’m doing mate, it’s what you´re doing. Come to remind you about some basics. You know what? Killing people is wrong, especially when there’s no good reason for it. 
-Tim, don´t make a fool of yourself like this. I remember what you went through, but we´re talking about Saddam Hussein here: the man is a mass murderer.
-Well kill him then, by all means, just leave everyone else out of it. Oh, can’t do that can you? Never mind. He´s a mass murderer; so what kind of murderers will you and your friends be?
-I haven’t got time to talk about this now.
-That’s alright, we’re not going anywhere. We’ll see you later on. 
After a day or two they somehow became accustomed to protesters living outside the gates. The others came and went, but Tim maintained a permanent vigil, accompanied by a young girl who seemed to have attached herself to him. When Patricia was working from home she invited them in for tea. Tim accepted gratefully, but the girl seemed suspicious, though she was quick enough to ask for use of the bathroom once they crossed the threshold. Tim followed Patricia into the kitchen.  
-That sign of yours was a good idea, she told him. The one that says, honk if you want to stop the war. Our road´s been quite noisy for a few days. I flatter myself that I live in middle England. I´d never have thought that so many neighbours cared about anything other than work and shopping. Just goes to show. Sugar?
-Two or three please, if you can spare it.
 -I think perhaps we can. But aren’t you both a bit cold out there all the time?
-Edith was sleeping rough for a month or two before we met; she’s tougher than me, but I manage. It is nice to get inside for a minute though.
-She seems like a nice girl
-Good job you’re saying that while she’s off having a pee. She wouldn’t take to being called nice.
-But very young. How old is she?
-I never asked. Why, is it important?
-I suppose not.
-Have you got any cakes?
-Of course; just here. Help yourself. Anyway, it’s good to see you looking so well. Last time I saw you, well you looked like you were at death’s door
-I’m clean now if that’s what you mean. Can’t afford not to be. There´s too much to do. Listening to David and his friends talking shit has done me some good at least. You should speak to him Pat. I know he doesn´t believe what he´s saying. Even if he has only a little bit of influence, he should use it. It could be like a snowball rolling downhill. It only needs to be started off. Everyone knows that the war is a fucked up idea: it takes a few people to admit it and then we can all stop pretending to believe.
 -You know we agreed we wouldn’t talk about that.
Edith joined them.
-About what? she asked.
-It’s okay, we were talking about trying to persuade my friend David not to be a prick. 
-It’s useless talking. We should be throwing bricks through the windows.
 -Yeah, right on girl. I expect you deliberately didn’t flush the toilet. But we should go. It was nice to see you Pat. Remember what I said. We’re not going anywhere so come out and chat, anytime. Got any smokes?
-I don’t.
-Just a last thought to leave you with then. You remember the first time this happened. They called it a war, but it was more like a killing spree. And it was all over the television every day: reporters getting carried away with excitement as they watched explosions from their hotels. Remember that line of tanks and trucks heading back from Kuwait, that was shot and bombed to pieces as they were trying to get home. It was a six lane highway blocked with the wreckage of two thousand vehicles. There were bodies in them, with all the flesh burned off. 
-I didn’t know what I was supposed to feel. I was crying and I could remember being in the South Atlantic on the boat with the planes coming at us. I thought; the bastards have made a mistake, showing this. People won´t stand for this being done in their name. But here we are, twelve years later, and it’s kicking off again. And my friend is on television telling everyone that this will all be justified in the name of peace. And he tells me not to act like a fool.
There was no answer that Patricia could give, but there was not much that she felt she could say to David either. At first the protest had annoyed David, more than Patricia expected. Later he was interested enough to ask Patricia what they were saying, though he had no intention of speaking to them himself.
-It’s just too easy for them, he complained. All they have to say is that war is bad, as if we didn´t already know. Nothing constructive about what we might do instead. It makes me weary: a complex situation like this, and they think it makes a difference if you hold up a banner and chant. 
-Do you really think that anyone who doesn´t have an alternative all worked out can´t have a valid opinion? Patricia asked him. 
-I don’t think opinions are much use without knowing something about the subject.
-Protest isn’t about writing a policy document David. That´s your job; that´s why you are the government. A protest is about saying that you are going about things in the wrong way. You find another way if it needs to be done. It´s called democracy I think. 
-Maybe you should be out there with them.
-Maybe I should. Lawyers have the same function you know, or at least they should have. That´s the rule of law: it doesn´t tell you what to do but you have to follow the rules. But you never had time for all that theory did you? You were always in such a hurry to go out and make money.
-It was never just about the money; you know that. And you know that in the end we have to answer to someone higher than the people. We have to do what we know is right.
-Don´t bring that into it. You think there’s a god who could care less about your view on foreign policy, or that you can know his wishes better than the people you represent?
Later, a police officer called at the house, eager to move the protesters on if David and Patricia would make a formal complaint. It turned out that the grass verge was part of their land and not attached to the public highway. Patricia met him at the gate, talking with Tim and being harangued by Edith, who was behaving as if she wanted to be arrested. Patricia thanked the officer for his concern and told him that no complaint would be made. In case he should be thinking of taking matters into his own hands, she went on to remind him that the right to peaceful protest was enshrined in law, and any trespass on her land was clearly a civil matter outside the officer´s jurisdiction. Tim and the officer looked equally confused, but both nodded agreement and the policeman left. 
So far as Patricia was concerned, David would have to learn to live with the situation. And though it seemed that the protest never caused him a moment´s doubt about his own actions, eventually David seemed almost pleased to have his old friend nearby, even as an enemy, and even if he was living under a plastic sheet in the street.
One night, after dinner, Patricia asked David if he thought they should invite Tim and the girl in for drinks. David’s reply was wistful.
-I think he’s happier where he is; out there with Edith or Emma, whatever her name is. He seems ten years younger. I don’t know where he suddenly found the energy.
Patricia didn´t answer for fear of starting their argument again. It comes from having a cause that you believe in she thought. Having a purpose can give you energy you didn’t believe you had. She remembered a time when David had known that, or at least she’d thought that he did.

Chapter Fourteen

It was unusual for Matthew to receive a call from David in the middle of the day. 
-Get yourself down to my office Matt, I need your help. I’ll see you in thirty minutes
-What about work?
-This is work.
David’s voice had been different from usual. His words were short and to the point, but the tone was tense; worried even. David was always polite when he asked you to do something, but normally he spoke with that confident ease that made you know that it had never entered his head that you might turn him down. Today he sounded almost pleading, and Matthew was intrigued. He left the office as soon as he could decently get away and drove straight to David’s house. 
The office was what had once been David’s snug; the place where they had spent so much time drinking and talking, in a past that seemed very far away. There was still a well stocked supply of alcohol, discreetly hidden away in a long beechwood cabinet, but the old furniture had gone, with the exception of one ruined chair with scuffed wooden arms and cushions of faded green baize barely supported by the sagging springs. Everything else about the room was modern and efficient looking.
Something was very wrong with David. He could not sit or stand still. Harold was already there when Matthew arrived, frowning importantly but saying nothing. He took his lead from David, and it seemed that David could not make up his mind how to begin. He kept picking things up, and putting them down; talking about inconsequential matters. It took a while before he said anything about the reason for his call.
-I’ve had a very interesting telephone conversation with one of my constituents, he began, finally. 
-It’s not like a politician to worry about constituents, between elections I mean.
 -Please: I don’t need sarcasm just now. This man rang me last night: I don’t know him, and I’ve never spoken to him before. I don’t even know how he knew that I’m his member of parliament. He’s been living in Spain for a while. The name may mean something to you; Mitchell Walcott. He seems to think that his story would have been in the papers not so long ago. 
-Yes, there was something; let me think. Maybe two years ago? Nothing much as I remember, just a small businessman who ran away. He had a partner, an ex-police officer, that’s why it made the news. The partner was disabled: he was one of these have-a-go heroes: took on some thugs who were burgling the office and they injured him quite badly. Walcott was the bookkeeper. A few days after the robbery he took off with all the cash in the business and left this poor chap in the lurch. 
-That was the story in the paper. The way Walcott tells it is a little different, but that’s not important. 
-What is important?
David threw up his hands and then shrugged
-Who knows? Nothing probably. It was a phone conversation and he was excited, not making a lot of sense. I tried to steady him down, but then he went paranoid on me. Said he couldn’t talk about it on the phone. He wants to see me in person, or someone else he knows he can trust. Said he can’t get out of Spain, and that his life is in danger. He told me that he thought that maybe if enough people know his story, then maybe it wouldn’t be worth him being killed to ensure his silence, but what the story is, I don’t know. Some kind of high level cover up.
-David, when I left the office, I was writing a story about two families that lived next door to each other for the last fifteen years and now they’ve fallen out over some bushes. An international conspiracy involving hit men sounds more exciting. On the other hand, it’s just possible that your caller is just a little crazy, or that he’s spent up and trying to blag a free ride back home. Maybe he’s just fell out with some of the local small time crooks. He sounds like the type.
-I agree, any one of those scenarios is likely, but we have to check it out.
-Tell me why?
-I’m his member of parliament.
-But tell me why you are interested. Spare me all that guff about your responsibilities. You must get as much attention from crazy people as I do, and this guy probably doesn’t even vote if he’s living in …
-Madrid, he says, but he wouldn’t give me an address or contact details. Says he’ll ring me back tonight to suggest a time and place, if I can find a way to make him feel safe.
 -And where do I come in?
I can’t go myself. In any case I could tell that he finds it hard enough to trust me so far as he has. But you’re a local celebrity Matt: your name is in the paper every night. He’ll feel that he knows you already, and he’s desperate to talk to a journalist to get his story out.
Matthew considered this.
-Very flattering. Look, every month I have to waste my time with at least one conspiracy fantasist who gets past my assistant. I expect you hear from them all the time. I don’t need to get on a plane to find another one. In any case if Walcott seriously thinks I am the man to help him break his story to the world’s press, he definitely is deluded. You have to do better than that David. Tell me the real reason. 
-Something about this is a lot more important to him than he is saying, Matthew thought. Harold’s looking like he wants to punch me, gripping the arms of that chair so hard he might tear them off. That gives me a good feeling at least. 
-Think of it as a favour to me, David replied. There’s something about the story that concerns me, even if I don’t know what it is. Occasionally you just have to trust to instinct. You’ll be travelling at my expense of course. A paid for weekend in Madrid can’t be too terrible. You know, he may not even show up, but at least if you go we can say we tried. On the other hand you might get a good follow up story to that burglary and absconding case, who knows. Check up on the partner when you get back; it could be one of those sympathy pieces about him rebuilding his life after being crippled by thugs, while his pal is living it up in the sun. That sort of rubbish. 
Matthew couldn’t see any kind of story in it, but in the end he agreed to do what David asked: didn’t he always? A flight and a hotel that was comfortable, but not embarrassingly lavish, were arranged for him. David told him that Walcott jumped at the suggestion that Matthew be the one to hear his story (I told you Matt, you’re a regional celebrity) and so the trip was settled. 
David drove him to the airport personally. It was a dark, wet night that made the prospect of a weekend in Southern Europe seem like not such a bad idea. The tickets and itinerary bulked in the chest pocket of his coat, with his passport. He felt a little of what he had imagined his career might be when he’d started off in journalism, even if the reality was only that he was running an errand for David; but why David should be so concerned about Walcott was much more interesting to Matthew than Walcott himself. He told himself that was the real reason he was making the journey. 
-Remember, David was telling him again. You have to find out where he’s living or at least where we can find him, otherwise there’s no way to do anything for him. Don’t push him too much though. You might reassure him that no-one cares about any money he is supposed to have run off with. The police know that was a tale made up by his partner even if nothing can be proved.
-Is that true?
-Don’t sound so surprised, Matt, you shouldn’t believe everything you read in the papers, even if you wrote it. Anyway, however you get it; address, phone number, contact details. Otherwise we can’t do anything. 
A sudden thought occurred to Matthew. 
-You don’t suppose at all that there’s any good reason for his paranoia, and that this trip could be dangerous do you? 
-Matthew, if I believed that for a moment do you think I’d let you go in my place? Just put it down to my curiosity. But please, indulge me just this once. Call me when you get to the hotel. 
It was obvious that David was not telling the whole story. He was so much on edge that he had not been able to invent plausible reasons for his concern. Maybe Walcott would shed some light on the situation, if only Matthew could find him. 

***

Matthew wasn’t the only person looking for someone; but Patricia was more interested in Walcott’s former partner than in the missing book keeper.
Patricia hadn’t gone looking for Derek Moss again: the flame of that case had died, though the frustration of it remained always hot enough to burn. It was the case that wouldn’t leave her alone, not the other way around.
When David spoke the name, in the course of some boring conversation about his constituency work, Patricia had to sit up and take notice. Moss wasn’t a big part of what David was talking about, but to Patricia, the name on its own was enough of a sign. She didn’t say anything about it to David, but she took more notice of the conversation and resolved to visit Mr Moss as soon as she could.
It turned out that Derek Moss had given up the investigation business after his accident; which was convenient because the business had given up on him before that. Somehow he’d found his way into a job at a law firm that specialised in debt recovery. 
Moss operated as a kind of consultant for the firm. He was supposed to explain the practical side of debt enforcement to the kids who actually ran the business. They were on the phones all day, chasing up money that was owed to clients, and since everything they said and did was selected from a menu of options on a computer screen, there was not much for Derek to do. That was fine with him: the job didn’t pay well, but he could be sure of being left alone. Also he felt that he enjoyed a certain status. It suited him to be thought of as an expert without having to take on responsibility. His back injury was an honourable wound that he did not hesitate to rely on, if necessary. 
Patricia didn’t know the law firm except by reputation, but Derek’s connection to the profession made him easy for her to trace. This time she didn’t just go to him and ask for information. She wanted to know a little more about him first. She discovered that Moss was a creature of habit. He lived alone, in a small house that he’d inherited from a relative. He wasn’t a drinker: he seemed to have no obvious vices and few interests. Most weeks he met the same acquaintances on the same night; and on Sunday he took his ancient mother to lunch, somewhere within easy driving distance. 
It was an old Victorian terrace house, not so charming, but not falling apart either. It was a Saturday afternoon and Patricia was surprised to see that the front door was ajar. She knocked, but no one answered, so she passed through the tiny hall to the scullery kitchen, where noises of someone scuffling about could be heard.
A large backside, which must have formed a substantial proportion of someone she assumed to be Derek Moss, was facing her; not so covered as it ought to have been by a pair of thin black trousers that struggled to contain the white fleshy expanse. The rest of Derek was wedged into a space between the kitchen drainer and the wall, hemmed in by what looked like a new washing machine.
-Excuse me, the door was open, Patricia called. Derek’s face appeared briefly in the tiny space that was visible between himself and the wall.
-Be with you in a minute. Just need to finish plumbing this in.
Patricia stepped nearer to the work in progress. 
-Sure you can manage? she asked. Must be hard for you, working in that corner.
-How do you mean?
-In that narrow space. With your bad back.
-Oh, yes. Quite hard. I suffer through it you know. There, it’s done. 
Improbably, it seemed that he was able to extricate himself from the working space. He pushed the washer into the area he’d vacated, using the considerable bulk of his person. Then he wiped his hand on a rag and offered to shake hands with Patricia.
-I remember we’ve met before, but it was a while ago. What can I do for you?
-My name is Patricia Thomas. I was one of the lawyers in the Obuswu case. I spoke to you a few years ago while you were in the hospital.
Moss looked like he’d been slapped, but there was none of the bluster of their previous meeting. He slumped a little, like a man who finds it too much trouble to be angry. 
-You don’t let go very easily. If you want to ask whether I have anything to tell you about that case, the answer is still no. 
-I’ve come with some good news. It looks like your old partner in the investigations business may have turned up. 
-You mean Mitchell.
-Yes, he’s been living in Spain you know, but he’s in some kind of trouble and I think he wants to come home. You could be in the news again Derek. He was quite the villain of the piece wasn’t he, at least in the reports? Of course if he turns up he may have a different story. 
-What are you getting at?
-Maybe I’m thinking about the insurance claim you submitted after that robbery, and all the money that was supposed to have disappeared with Walcott. 
-That’s old news
-And difficult to prove, probably. But even employers like yours, who obviously don’t bother with criminal record checks, might be concerned if I talked to them about an employee who’s suspected of insurance fraud as well as having a record.
Patricia remembered that Moss had never been prosecuted for the thefts from the police station, but that was for him to argue. He didn’t seem to have any argument left in him.
-I remember the last time we spoke. You were like a little girl then. You’ve changed. It sounds like you’re threatening me. 
-Maybe I am threatening you Derek. But I can also promise you something. I promise you that whatever you tell me, it’s only for my personal information. Just between us and it goes no further. 
There was something about the way that she said it which made Derek believe her. He paused. 
-Just between us I might be able to live with. You’re catholic aren’t you?
-How do you know that? And why do you want to know?
-You’re not the only one who remembers things. Your husband is that MP who wants to be the next prime minister. I’ve heard of you. Knew I’d seen you before.
-But why does it matter?
-It means you understand confession. Just let me wash my hands. I’ll make us some tea. 
Attending to the kettle and mugs helped Derek to steady himself. Once they’d settled into the tiny lounge, with its oversized armchairs, and Moss had squeezed his bulk into the most distressed of them, he seemed more himself again; almost relaxed. 
-I should tell you at the start, he said. I killed John Obuswu. I didn’t mean to do it, though I did mean to hurt him. I never meant to kill anyone, but I beat him and he died. 
-The station log said that you were only in the cells for ten minutes. That’s not enough time for the beating he had.
-It was a bit longer than ten minutes. The desk sergeant did me a favour. And there were no prisoners in the next cells to hear anything. But poor John didn’t make much noise anyway. That’s a reason I didn’t know I’d gone too far. I’ve asked myself over the years if I was just unlucky; whether there was something wrong with him already; whether I hit him harder than I meant to. Either way it changes nothing.
There was something unpleasant in the way he talked of being unlucky, as if he had been the injured party. Patricia ignored the self pity. For now she only needed the facts.
-You must have had a reason.
-I expect you heard when you were doing your snooping that I was a racist. Well it’s true, I’m white and I prefer my own people. It was more accepted in those days. You didn’t have to justify it. But it wasn’t for that. The truth is I was trying to do my job.
-By giving a drunken tramp a beating?
-Beatings weren’t so unusual then either. Just a way to get information, though it never was my style, whether you believe me or not. Some of the lads used to say I was soft. I’ve never been a violent man. Look at me. I’m fat, slow, and lazy. I was the same then as I am now. But it was accepted that sometimes you needed to be a bit rough to break a case. As it turned out, it was the case that broke me.
-I looked at the records of the cases you were working. I couldn’t tell what you might have wanted to see John about. 
-Did you come across the name of Francis O’Riordan?
-The sex abuse case?
-That was the one. I’d been working on it for weeks. In my own time as well as at work. I had some dedication in those days. When they sacked me, you know, it was nothing to do with Obuswu. Back then, anyone who suspected I might have hit John too hard would have shrugged and been grateful it wasn’t them in my position. Anyway that’s beside the point. Like I said, no one believed I had something like that in me. They told me at the disciplinary, afterwards, that I was a disgrace as an officer, and that was true as well; but I hadn’t been dishonest; not before that night. Afterwards I admit, I didn’t care. Maybe I was looking for a way out. Being thrown out was a relief when it finally came. 
-But before John, I was trying to do what I thought was the job, and the O’Riordan case was one of those that got to me. They say everyone has one or two that get hold of them like that. 
-You remember the case. The lad was leaving church after choir practice when it happened, and by the time they found him he was unconscious. You saw the medical summary probably, so I’ll not go into it. The poor little mite was buggered to within an inch of his life. He couldn’t tell us anything afterwards. Claimed he could remember nothing. 
-I remember it was a distressing case.
-Distressing isn’t the word. There were some memories from my own childhood that… well, there’s no need to go into that either. In any case I was going to find the guilty party in that case whatever happened, and maybe I was desperate to prove to the men and to myself that I could do the job, whatever they said about me being soft. 
-But what does any of that have to do with John?
-I forget, you only read the reports. There’s always a lot they leave out.  You know that at the time Obuswu was picked up he was sleeping in the cemetery at the Parish Church, but that wasn’t the only place he dossed out. He was a regular at Saint Pats as well. That was where the attack took place, remember. 
-And there’s other stuff about John you won’t have read. When he was out of it, he was in the habit of pulling out his plonker and waving it around. Indecent exposure as they say. Showed it to boys as well as girls. Looking back I’m not sure he would have known the difference; the state he was in most of the time. 
-So you thought that…?
-It was more than guessing. I had a witness. Someone who put him in the right place on the night of the attack. One of his mates if you can call them that. But no one likes that kind of thing, so I wasn’t surprised he told me. Blacks hate that queer stuff more than we do. 
-In any case you can imagine how much good one of John’s drinking pals would be as a witness in court, with clever people like you working for the defence. I was sure I knew what the score was, but I had no way to prove it; not without a confession. And then Johnny was pulled into the cells when I happened to be at the station. It was too good a chance to let slip. 
-What did he tell you about it?
-I was stupid to think that he’d be able to tell me anything. He wasn’t making any sense. He was frightened of course, and who knows what state his brain was in. I thought if I could frighten him some more it would shock him to sense. And I wanted him to know that I knew. I wanted him to feel my anger. 
-He didn’t scream or plead or anything. Just whimpered a bit.  At first that made me more angry. And then I realized it was useless. I left it then. I asked George to look in on him later and I went home. He didn’t look much worse than others you might see on any Friday night in those days, to be honest. 
-I went home thinking I should feel good about it. He was a black bastard. He deserved it. The lads would see that I wasn’t frightened to get my hands dirty. But I didn’t sleep. I knew it was wrong. If I could have taken it back I would have done, even not knowing how it would turn out; that he’d be dead. That’s something else you can believe or not, but it’s true. And that’s the first part of my confession finished.  
-You mean there’s more?
-I mean there’s a reason why John Obuswu’s name was never linked to that crime. He never attacked the boy. 
Moss had seemed quite calm in the course of his narrative, but now he got up to stretch out his back. Patricia saw that he was sweating heavily into his shirt. He took a step to the window and paused to steady himself against the sill, staring for a moment at something unseen outside. His thin black hair hung in strands down his fat neck. He was trembling a little as he leaned against the glass. Patricia wondered if he had a heart murmur: or was the shaking caused by the stress of the moment. Finally he slouched back into his chair. She watched him silently, anxious not to interrupt his mood. 
-I found out not long after that John couldn’t have been the one responsible, he said.
-Did you speak to the boy?
-He never said anything at the time. Later I had my own problems. Now it’s too late.
-What do you mean?
-Francis O’Riordan swallowed a bottle of sleeping tablets when he was fourteen years old. 
-That’s terrible. But then…
-If you had the medical report on his case. You’d see that the doctor did a very full report on his injuries. You might remember that in those years, the specialists at the city hospital were obsessed with diagnosis of child abuse. It was the fashion for a while.
-I remember that epidemic of taking children into care. It seemed a little like hysteria; as if the doctors had persuaded themselves that most parents were abusers.
 -Yeah, it was out of control. But there wasn’t any doubt in this case, and the evidence was clear. What happened to Francis: what left him unconscious that night; had happened to him before. To spare you the details, the doctors could tell from the wounding and healing of old wounds that it had happened to him several times, over a period of months. 
-But John had only been in the city a week or two when he died. 
-Exactly.
-So no one knows who was responsible. 
-You could say that. No one was ever prosecuted and as far as I know the investigation went no further. The evidence could still be there though. You have the medical reports and I suppose they test for DNA these days, if they have a suspect, and useable samples.
 -Do you have a suspect? 
-It’s a hard thing for me to say. The priest of St. Patricks was moved on to another parish a few months after the attack. They sent him back to the old country, somewhere out in the sticks. He was a popular priest. There’s no reason why they’d banish him to the back of beyond, no reason why he’d want to go. Or only one that I can think of.
-You mean you think that it was him and that someone knew.
-Or suspected. But I never followed up on it myself; call it superstition, or cowardice or bitterness. I don’t know. But that’s the second part of my confession. I’ve done nothing all these years. For all I know the old bastard is doing the same or worse somewhere in the wilds of Ireland, where no-one will ever lay a hand on him for it. 
-We’ve got to do something. 
There’s no we, it’s up to you. The burden passes to you now. You know as much as I do. What you do with it, is up to you. I feel a little better for your knowing. I’ve never even told a priest what I’ve said to you just now, so thank you. 

***

In a small bar outside the centre of Madrid, not far from Arturo Soria, sipping coffee under a sky of untroubled blue, Matthew met Walcott and heard his story. That night he typed up a written record from the scribbled notes he made as they spoke. 
After leaving England, for reasons that were not clarified, Mitchell had no job and little money. He went to the south, along with all the other English, and hung around Malaga, working in bars for cash when he could; picking up bits of the language and living day to day. He had no idea what he wanted except that he did not want to go back. 
In some of the bars where he worked, there were little pieces of book keeping that needed to be done. It seemed that the ex-patriots didn’t trust Spanish accountants, and couldn’t afford the English ones. Soon he was running a small business that had started without him noticing, keeping books in order for struggling bar owners who had come to the Costa in search of their dreams. He began to understand the ways of the local officials, and pick up some basic tricks in the way of dealing with them. Soon he was able to help clients avoid the more obvious difficulties with the regional authorities. What language he needed seemed to come easily to him, even though he’d learned nothing in the rudimentary French lessons he’d suffered in the secondary school.
There came a point quite soon where he enjoyed the trust of his little English speaking community. He picked up more work through recommendations. One job was for a man who had a building project running along the coast close to Fuengirola. This man had suffered bad experiences in his dealings with local investors, but he needed a partner to move the project on. His bank facilities were fully extended, but the bank manager had given the name of a possible private investor from Madrid: a very cultured man, very anglophile; not really a businessman at all in fact, but the manager was sure that he had funds that could be made available at terms that would suit all the parties.
 The developer supposed that the Madrid gentleman would be a relative of the bank manager, but the money was the same colour. Anyway what choice did he have?
The proposal was that Mitchell should prepare a business plan setting out the funding case; meet the man in Madrid, and explain the opportunity to him. If the investor was serious and could prove funds, he would visit Malaga a short time later, to view the site and close the deal. If it came off, there would be a bonus commission for Mitchell. It was also understood that if this transaction was successful, there could be a more permanent understanding between Mitchell and the developer on future projects. 
It was exciting for Mitchell. He sensed a glorious future within reach. He quickly drafted the business case and took the high speed train to Madrid checking into the cheapest lodgings he could find, to prepare for the big meeting the next day. 
The next day was 11 March 2004. In the morning he checked out of the room early and joined the commuters headed for the Madrid central station. His contact had requested a breakfast meeting and he wanted to allow plenty of time to find the offices. He’d been through the numbers thoroughly and he was confident they made sense, but he was on edge about the meeting and preoccupied with how he should approach the investor. He barely registered the stations as they went by. 
It was just after half past seven in the morning, as his train was pulling into Atocha Central, that the bomb exploded in the next carriage. Later, he heard about bombs that had exploded on other trains, more or less at the same time, all along the line. 
He couldn’t remember much about the explosion. Afterwards he read eye witness accounts later from people who described horrible things that maybe he saw too; but none of it stayed in his memory. His mind held no clear image of getting off the train and stumbling away, aimlessly. Some people seemed to be heading the same way; others were hurrying in the opposite direction, towards the carnage. He had no impression of where anyone was going. Still more people appeared, some with uniforms, shouting to each other; the voices of authority.
He could remember thinking that he didn’t want to get into trouble, even if he had no idea why he should be. He began to walk away, out of the station. He wasn’t stopped or challenged. Everyone’s attention was directed on the scene inside. He was still holding his case. Suddenly, it seemed very important to get to the meeting without being late. He looked at his watch, but the face was smashed and there was no display. He noticed what seemed to be quite a lot of blood on the cuff of his jacket, but so far as he could tell it was not his. 
Outside the station he stopped, halfway across the dual carriageway crossing. There was a man on the other side of the broad street, a little apart from the crowd of pedestrians, ignoring the general melee. He was standing quite still and looking towards the station. He had on a long, dark overcoat, though it was not cold, and he almost seemed to be standing to attention; his arm was extended in a stiff gesture. Mitchell had seen the pose before, in the old black and white photographs that still decorated some of the older bars; he recognized the Franquist salute. 
However it was not the strange gesture that held his attention across the lanes of traffic. Even at that distance his recollection of the memorable face was perfectly clear. The long, dark features, the precise military style of dress and bearing, the small chin and the proud, angry eyes: it was certainly the man who Ray Hawkins had told him, two years earlier, was a police officer; the one who’d wanted Ray to sell him something.
The man was staring at him now: probably quite a few people were. There was blood on Mitchell’s torn coat, his hair was awry, and there was more blood running down one side of his face from a slight gash that he would notice later. His placid expression, standing at the pedestrian crossing with his business case in his hand, as if nothing had happened, must have made him seem deranged. But more than this, it was clear to him that the other had recognized and remembered him: a part of him registered this before his conscious brain knew it. His body was turning to run even as his mind struggled to make any connection to the circumstances.
And the other was following, he was sure of it. He heard the crossing signal beeping behind him and scuffling and shouts as the man pushed crossers out of the way and ran after him. Mitchell headed back towards the station. The lights were against him, but the traffic was hardly moving. He raced between the cars, not stopping to look at anything. He never heard the whining engine of the approaching motor scooter, speeding between the cars; just a squeal of brakes and a thump; then metal crashing against metal as the scooter piled into the cars. He looked round once to see his pursuer lying in the road between the cars, under the helmeted body of the bike rider; kicking furiously to get free. 
Mitchell did not wait to see if either of them got up: he jogged back into the station. There someone stopped him and others came to help him clean up and establish that his injuries were not serious. He insisted he did not want to wait for an ambulance and did not need a check up. He walked a few blocks intending to find a cab. There probably wouldn’t be any more trains that day, so he thought the best thing to do would be to catch the first available flight back to Malaga. Then he started to worry: if the man really was a policeman, he might be able to trace Mitchell. For all he knew they already had his passport details. They could have been watching him for months. Obviously the police believed he really was a partner of Ray Hawkins.
He dare not use his passport, or even return to Malaga. Even his semi-official existence there would have left some trace. The only safe place for the moment seemed to be the boarding house. No one knew he was there.

***

-And there he stays, Matthew concluded. He told me that this Ray Hawkins was a professional criminal, probably a killer, who he accidentally bumped into some years ago. The man hijacked him to sit in on a conversation in London, with this Spanish person who is supposed to be a policeman. He says he has no idea what the connection is between them. I can’t make sense of it
-But you got the address? David sounded greedy for the information.
-Maybe, but hold on. When I’d been talking to this guy for a while, I realized there was more to this than the usual paranoid delusions, even though his story seems crazy. The fear is different: and there are other things. This is not someone who is spinning a complex fantasy around a few coincidences. Those sort of people are waiting for you to raise objections because they have everything worked out. They weave explanations into the story so that they can explain to you how it all fits together. Walcott’s story is full of loose ends, and I don’t believe he has any appreciation of what he is involved in, or what it all means. To be honest, he’s not even interested in making sense of it; he just wants to get clear. All sorts of little hints make me think I should believe he’s telling the truth.
-Well we can at least help him get clear, that’s my job in fact. If you’ll just tell me where I can find him.
-David, he asked me not to give those details to anyone, not even you. And in any case it’s a story. It’s like you asking me to divulge a source. I would be breaking professional standards.
-I see all of a sudden it’s a matter of integrity and you’re a professional journalist: not a cheap scribbler on a local rag who took a weekend break at my expense. 
Matthew looked at him, astonished by this outburst.
-Matt, I’m sorry I didn’t mean that. I am under a lot of pressure at the moment, nothing to do with this case. But remember you weren’t there as a journalist, you were there to help me help my constituent, so let’s be sensible.
-But there is a story, even so. There are some other things; things he told me about this mysterious Mr Hawkins, that I should follow up. 
-Hawkins might be dangerous for you.
-Why do you say that? Anyway my guess is the story doesn’t stop with Hawkins, he sounds like a man who does things that another man decides. I’ve done some digging around already. For instance do you know what titadyn is?
-A secret society?
-It’s a sort of explosive, used a lot in mining, common in mines in southern France, which means the Basque separatists can easily get hold of it and have made it their favourite bomb ingredient. According to Walcott, Hawkins told him that the mysterious policeman tried to buy this stuff from them, at a meeting that Walcott attended more or less accidentally. He really has a knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Why Hawkins would say anything to him about it, I have no idea. Anyway, Walcott thinks that the policeman was trying to see if Hawkins had links with ETA.
-And what do you think?
-Doesn’t explain all the facts, or at least what I think I know. But I don’t know enough to think anything yet. 
 -Certainly you don’t have enough for any story that you could print
-Agreed, not yet anyway.
-And it’s a bit far off the beaten track for the Examiner, in any case.
-I know
For a while they sat, silently. David had again started to fidget. Matthew sprang to his feet in exasperation
-For God’s sake David, we are supposed to be friends. Just tell me.
-Tell you what?
-Tell me what is the matter? Why should any of this matter to you?
-I know Hawkins
-How could that be?
-He’s an unusual man, maybe not quite stable. From these parts originally, but I think he left for good a long time ago. One of the things he does for a living is selling arms, in a small way; not in a strictly legal way. He’s the one to make deals with the sort of people that others don’t particularly want to talk to. Works on commission mostly. Sometimes he might help out with other problems too, for people who don’t have any other way to get things done.
-Are you telling me you were dealing weapons through this man?
-God no, we were never involved in anything illegal like that. But it’s guilt by association isn’t it? Something like this comes out and the hacks from the nationals don’t have to accuse you to your face of anything. They just hint and imply. If you say nothing, they note that no explanations have been given: if you try to explain they take everything the wrong way on purpose and tear you to pieces. If a Hawkins connection comes out, it damages me: just when I’m looking at a ministerial portfolio.
-You should tell me exactly how much you know about Ray Hawkins. 
-Not much to tell. I was introduced through Albert. You probably guessed that Albert’s people were my backers when I took Cromwell over. You didn’t think I had the kind of money to do it on my own? Poor Albert had friends based in Switzerland.
-Zurich
-Yes. You remember the visit. 
-But the company was yours. You had all the shares. You’re the one who got rich. What was in it for them?
-They took a slice along the way. They needed to have someone they could trust so that they could remain anonymous. That was me. But to be truthful, there was probably more to it than a cut of the profits. I’ve been careful never to look at it too carefully, and you know I’m no accountant, but there are some numbers that don’t seem to add up. I think it may have been useful to them that we had contracts that were classified as defence contracts even though ours was not sensitive procurement. It meant we could trade legally in lots of countries. 
-You always swore to me that all your exports were fully licensed. You said it was just machinery and spares.
-And that’s true Matt, I swear it now. We never broke the law. You know I never wanted to sell any kind of defence goods in the first place. I only wanted to save the company. And things were so hard, and I had so many people depending on me. I’d told all of them, no redundancies here, your jobs are safe; we’re in this together. I couldn’t go back to them and say, sorry, I got it wrong, all the profitable contracts have a military application so I’m shutting us down. 
-Go on.
-All our contracts were legal, and what we shipped was legal, but looking at the paperwork, some of the quantities don’t make sense. If we’ve shipped goods to the value of a hundred thousand, you might see invoicing that suggests we’ve shipped a lot more than that.
-But what you sell is pretty bulky. If there was a shortfall on the delivery it would be obvious to the customer.
-Pretty bulky, exactly. So it could happen that by the time they arrived, there might be other things in the containers, besides what we shipped. Less bulky things, more nasty things, things that people were prepared to pay good money for but which shouldn’t have been there. 
-You mean smuggled goods
-All duly invoiced and paid for, making the money clean.
-When did you find out?
-I never did find out. I’m only guessing. I’ve only just admitted to myself that the reason I didn’t look into it more closely was because I preferred not to know. I’ve been turning a lot of old stuff over in my head lately.
Matthew agreed with David that they both needed a drink. David sloshed whisky into the tumblers. His hands were not steady. They sat down again, facing each other in the armchairs, as they had done so many times over the years. 
-What does Harold say about this?
-I haven’t told Harold what I’ve told you, but maybe he knows anyway.
-It’s true he is pretty quick to sniff out dirt. It’s his natural habitat.
-This isn’t about Harold. You’ve always been hard on him. Someone has to do his job. Do you think the other side doesn’t have their own Harold’s? They have whole teams of them.
-As you say, this is not about him. You tell me often enough I’m not prepared to get my hands dirty, and how useless that makes me.
-I’m sorry if I’ve put it like that
-It doesn’t matter.
-It all matters. It matters to me when I think about the questionable things I’ve had to do to get this far, and the good I’ve been able to do as a result. I balance it all the time, the good I’ve done and might still do, against the compromises, and what you would call the dishonesty. I weigh the scale in my mind every day.
-Which way is it tipping now?
-I can live with anything I’ve done. I know you’re a sceptic, but we have done good work, me and my team; yes Harold as well. We’ve made some things better and fairer than they would have been, even though you tell me it’s impossible to prove that kind of claim. And what’s more important, we can do more; we really can. 
-It’s such a hard climb to get to the point where you can make a difference. You have to do some bad things on the way up, to get there; and all the time you have to hang on to the state of grace; the pure intention; so that when you do have the chance, it is still someone with the right values and ideals who makes the big decisions. You must hold on to the good in yourself even when you’re dealing with the most corrosive realities. That’s why you need family and friends around you.
-You’ve thought about it a lot.
-Of course. And I’m on the verge of reaching that point, of having power. Soon it’ll be a seat in the cabinet and then who knows?
-I thought they were only offering you a junior minister position
-That’s only the start.
-I’m sorry David, it doesn’t persuade me. We don’t see the world in the same way. In my world, your future holds as much compromise and shabbiness if you sit on the front bench as if you sit at the back, probably more. Everyone has to take shit. The president in Washington has got to wade through more of it than you do.
David shrugged.
-You think like that because you’re resigned to nothing ever changing and the wrong people always getting power, in a world getting a little worse every day. I’m not prepared to give in like that.
-Let’s talk about Walcott.
-Give me his address, we’ll find him, bring him back to the UK, where he’s safe, and persuade him to keep quiet about the whole thing. You said yourself he’s got no money, no connections and no curiosity. No-one would listen to his wild stories and he knows it. He’s just looking for an out. 
-Tell me first what Hawkins did for you.
-You remember when that little bastard Foster tried to take over the company?
-Of course
-It was a carefully planned ambush. We didn’t have anywhere to go. He’d spent months gently steering the business to be just where he wanted it. He bought the American company to get us into debt. So when he made his move, the clock was ticking and we only had hours to respond. He was sure we had no way to raise extra cash. In any case he was in league with the weasels at the bank. 
-Albert’s friends agreed to invest some more money in the company, privately, to get us over the hump, but there was still Foster himself to deal with. And he wanted to grind my face in the dirt as much as he wanted anything else. He wasn’t satisfied with just money. Hawkins persuaded him that it would be a better idea to take a very generous payout and go.
-I never saw or heard about Foster after that, what became of him?
-He walked away with a suitcase full of cash. Probably more than he would have netted from his dirty little scam. He was still disappointed of course; would have liked to have seen it played through. There’s something about a rat like him that takes as much pleasure in dishonesty for its own sake as what he can get from it.
-Suppose he hadn’t agreed to back off?
-The question didn’t arise, because he agreed. Are you going to give me these details or not?
Matthew was sitting on the edge of the chair, back arched over, head in his hands; one arm trailing an almost empty glass.
-I can’t tell you just at this moment. I’ll ring you later tonight. Do you mind if I refill this? 
He sloshed more whisky into the glass.
-So that was you and Albert then, he continued. I’ve often wondered. I miss him a lot you know. I suppose a bad thing happened.
-I couldn’t say. He just disappeared.
Matthew thought about that.
-But it’s like if your cat goes missing. After a while you know that you won’t see him again.
 -You know I was thinking just the other day, about a story Albert told me, from when he was in North Africa, doing a deal with someone he only called the Major. He wouldn’t say more than that about the business, but I suppose I can guess now. Anyway, he explained to me in some detail this visit that the Major had organized to a local brothel, and Albert and everyone else was obliged to be there. I suppose they were proud of the facility and the hospitality was compulsory. He was amusing in the way he talked about it; he didn’t let his own feelings show: but I was thinking, why is he telling me this about himself? I was a little disgusted to be honest. 
-I can see now that it would be helpful for him to have a sin on his mind that he could actually confess. I’m sure that the other things, all the secrets that he couldn’t mention, made him feel worse. 
-I think that what he was trying to let me know was that it disgusted him too; this episode and all the other bad things he did. But he refused to turn away from them or pretend they hadn’t happened. He’d look at them without blinking. He would have liked to say, I am better than these things I’ve done, only he couldn’t, because he was honest and he believed that you were no more or less than what you did. I hope he found a way through all that anguish in the end. He was more troubled than we realized.
David swirled the contents of his glass, without drinking. He appeared to be making a big effort to control a powerful emotion; whether of fear, impatience or anger was difficult to say. 
-I don’t know about any of that, he said, but I can tell you the last thing that Albert said to me. He said that the English had begun to terrify him.
-He never did like it here much.
-You’re wrong. He loved this country. You know how he was always going on about Joseph Conrad? He used to say, let me get it right, that Conrad was a Pole who felt privileged to be a part of the British Empire at a time when it was a civilising principle as much as a collection of territories, even though he could see that it was based on robbery as much as idealism. He said he felt a little the same, that he was an outsider who felt privileged to witness the same nation in the vanguard of civilisation’s decline.
-That doesn’t sound so complimentary. Why did we scare him?
David tried to find words to explain. It was hard. The drink had affected him more than he expected and his mind was on other things. He saw Albert, occupying the chair that Matthew now sat in. The only one left from the old days. He tried to remember the exact words. 
Europe looks to Britain to see its future; not for the useless cars or the dying industries, but for ideas, music and language. There’s no linguistic insulation to keep American culture at bay, and it has killed off the continental tradition of looking at society as a collective enterprise. In Europe religion has died, but there are established institutions and habits of thought that enforce at least lip service to the idea of living together for mutual benefit. Americans despise collective society. They worship god and the individual, sincerely. But they have so much of everything that no-one starves, and their god recognizes philanthropy as the supreme egoism The American businessmen will swindle and cheat widows and orphans for the glory of being able to give the proceeds away to good causes. Englishmen will do the same but put the money in a vault.
England is unique in taking on the American notion of a society that is all against all, but without the mitigating idealism of religion. In the future, the American god will die like all the others, and the American denial of society will infect Europe, which does not have the energy to resist; and so we end the same. The English are the laboratory mice, crammed so closely together that they have started to bite each other
That was only part of what he’d said. How to summarize it for Matthew? David sighed. He wasn’t sure it mattered anyway.
-It was as complicated as you’d expect, he said. He saw the future of the developed world here. He believed we were the proof that once ordinary people felt secure enough not to rely on their neighbour for help, they no longer cared about their neighbour. Once that happens, things start to fall apart. It’s a vicious circle, he said; once you feel you personally don’t need the collective resources, you stop valuing them and start to resent contributing to them. You come to view the people who do depend on them with increasing levels of contempt. Those people are a challenge to your value system as well as a cost. He had a lot to say like that. 
-Did he convince you?
-I don’t know. It’s been a long night. I can’t think clearly about it now. Give me the Spanish guy’s details and let’s just stop for now. 
-I told you I can’t say now whether I am prepared to do that. I’ll call you in the morning. I have to go home now, anyway. I’ve had too much to drink, and I can’t think straight either. I feel like one of Albert’s Englishmen, doomed by the laws of natural selection, and general incompetence and lack of faith.

Two days later, Mitchell Walcott decided he couldn´t stand his situation any longer. He had to take some kind of action. Matthew James had told him to stay put, had even given him some money for the room. James had said that he would be back in touch again soon: but since then, nothing. Meanwhile Walcott could not step on the street. The glance of each stranger he passed seemed to carry a hidden significance, and the meaning was always sinister. 
After breakfast that morning, Mitchell checked out of the hotel and asked the owner to get him a cab. He paid the bill in cash, reminding him that his own funds were not going to last forever. 
The taxi driver held the door open for him, and closed it behind, taking Mitchell’s pathetic remnant of a case with exaggerated care and moving to the back of the vehicle to drop it in the opened trunk. The boot was slammed and the driver got in. The cab moved away from the kerb. Except that it was not his driver at the wheel. Mitchell looked back to see the taxi driver standing in the road, gravely watching his cab disappearing. So who was in the driver’s seat?
-Hello again Mitchell, good to see the face of another Englishman in this country. I’ve been a bit lonely here.
Ray Hawkins turned round and grinned at him, shark-like as ever.
-Lovely day for a drive, don’t you think. Where shall we go?

***

David could not shake off the memory of his last conversation with Hawkins. He poured himself another drink and sat, brooding. It was late evening. The house was silent. He was alone. 
Hawkins had expressed no surprise on hearing from him, though they had not spoken for so long. It was only by chance, David thought, that he had kept the number, after that time in Switzerland. Hawkins had told him that he was in the area and some things were best not dealt with on the telephone. He’d called round to the house as soon as David could be sure of being alone, but David hadn’t needed to explain very much. Hawkins simply said that he saw the problem and would deal with it. They both understood that David did not want to know the details of what dealing with the problem might mean. 
David had thought that would be the end of the conversation, but Hawkins had something more to tell him; about Albert. 
It was a shock to hear that news, but not exactly a surprise. David had never asked his ex-partner about his other business interests, but he had long assumed they involved some element of danger. 
-Did you know Albert well? He´d asked Hawkins.
-In the way that our paths kept crossing; I suppose, was the reply. He spoke to me about you once or twice. He was quite proud of you. Said that you were a man of principle, always keeping your eye on the greater good. He was always going on about abstract things like that. It´s beyond me, mostly. I think he saw you as a little bit innocent. Quite amusing given our current transaction. You could say Albert was a business associate of mine.
- Tell me, what kind of business was it? Did it ever involve Cromwell in any way? 
Hawkins laughed.
-You still don’t get it at all do you? Your business was all about arms dealing; pure and simple; right from the off.
-You´re mistaken. We were an export company; precision engineering mostly. We made some caterpillar treads for tracked vehicles; some of them were classed as military. But that´s all. And we had licences for all those jobs 
-Is that what you really believe? You must have wondered what was in some of your shipping crates besides the official contents. And didn´t you ever get curious about any of the invoices?
-Are you saying that Cromwell was a front?
-Partly that, but as well most of what you made and exported was military too, even if it wasn´t obvious. If you´re clever enough you can make what you call your precision parts look harmless enough. When they get where they are wanted, maybe with a bit of simple modification, they turn out to be just the thing to upgrade your helicopter gunship or whatever toy it might be.
-Albert wouldn´t have known how to do that. He was no kind of engineer.
-Of course not and in any case the officials looking at these things are not stupid, but they can turn a blind eye if the thing doesn´t look too obvious. Albert used to use a phrase, plausible deniability. And he had help of course, from his bosses in British Intelligence.
-Now you’re telling me he was a spy?
Hawkins sighed as if he was explaining a simple matter to a not very bright child.
-Albert was an arms dealer, in a big way. Think about it. I do small time business, but even I go to places and speak to people that the spooks want to hear about. And they know all about me of course. I have to be careful; keeping them happy but not giving them anything that will come back to me. The way it works is that I help them with these bits and pieces, and my existence is tolerated. 
-You and Albert, on the other hand, well the volumes and the sort of stuff that you shipped, I wouldn’t call it arms dealing. Foreign policy more like. Albert was on their payroll more or less from the start. Maybe he started as a simple trader, like me, but you know he did actually believe in what he was doing. He thought that underneath all the dirt, he was part of trying to make things better; pushing a government in the right direction, toppling a dictator here, supporting a democracy there.
-Did it ever make things better? 
-You´re asking the wrong person. I was a soldier Mr Thomas, before I was anything else. You don´t get to see a master plan in the poor bloody infantry: just a succession of fuckups and one damn thing after another. The only principle I´ve found that was worth remembering was the one about my enemy’s enemy being my friend. But the bastards keep swapping places. I never saw any pattern or greater scheme in it. Albert used to say that you could only deal with your own part of the puzzle and trust that whoever was directing operations had the right motives – keeping the greater good in mind, so to speak.
-But you know, in the end, he couldn’t believe even in that any more. That was what finished him.
-What you’ve just finished telling me is that I have been living a lie for half my life.
-No need to sound so glum about it. You’re alive, you’re well off. I was reading about you in the paper. Wealthy businessman turned politician, tipped for future high office. That’s all bollocks of course, you must know. If you got close to office you´d have to be vetted more closely, and then someone would pass a quiet word about your past to the right ear, in a discreet sort of way.
-On the bright side you are protected. Nothing will ever come of this Spanish thing whatever happens, but as for being a minister of state, forget it.
David had not taken in much of the conversation after hearing those words. He was ashamed but honest enough to admit that they had obliterated the sense of repugnance he was feeling for what he was asking Hawkins to do, as well as wiping away any feeling of sympathy for poor Albert. 
It was true of course. He was finished before he had even properly begun. No one would even know why it should be so. He’d felt only relief when Hawkins left him alone. Now he sipped a whisky that seemed to have no taste or fire to it anymore, and struggled to think clearly. 
What had it all been for? If this was as far as the road went, how should he balance the scales: the little good he’d managed to do against the dirty compromises he’d agreed to or winked at? Could he be sure that he had ever had the right motives to begin with? If so, why had he not told Hawkins to leave that grubby little man in Madrid alone, now that it was all for nothing? Not that Hawkins would have taken any notice. He had his own reasons to get rid of Walcott.
For some reason, David started to remember a trip that he and Patricia had taken the year before, to a Spanish island. They had gone for a few days to enjoy some winter sunshine. The whole island was a volcano, and he’d driven the hired car from the coast to the top of it. As they drove across the vast flat plain that lay inside the original caldera, he wondered at the scale of an eruption that could have created this landscape like the surface of a dead planet. They parked at the foot of the slope of the present, active cone that stood in the centre of the lava desert. From there you could take a cable car to the very top, but they had decided to hike. 
Coming up in the car, they had gained height too quickly for David’s body to adjust to the thin air, and every movement and breath cost him an effort of will. Patricia seemed completely unaffected, so David had said nothing. But when they started to walk, the slope seemed to be much steeper than he had imagined. There was the smell of sulphur, and in places yellow smoke emerging from little cracks in the rock: his insides felt like water mixed with acid, and soon his face and fingers were tingling. Eventually he could not continue, and sank to his knees. Patricia, a little way ahead, continued for a while then stopped and turned. He waved her away as he began retching. His eyes were full of tears that clouded his vision. 
He’d imagined then how it would feel if the volcano started to erupt at that moment. An image formed in his mind of people in a town below; he was among them; seeing the smoke and gas and ash fill the air. There were no reds of molten lava, no colours whatsoever: just the grey of smoke and the grey of ash that began to cover everything and bleed the colour out of the world. He could hear choking coughing as people fought for breath, as he was doing. And the world was becoming grey: everywhere the taste and smell and colour of ash, that covered everything like dirty snow which would never melt. In that moment he could taste the imagined memory of ash in his mouth. 
He could taste it still. 
David went back into the office, where the whisky was kept, to fetch another bottle. There were two battered paperback books on the little table that Hawkins had handed to him without much comment. The spines were broken and the paper was stained but all the pages somehow clung together. David began to leaf through some of the well thumbed pages. When he looked up, Albert was waiting for him, seated in his favourite wrecked armchair that David had never been able to bring himself to throw out. David looked at him with mild surprise. 
-They told me you were dead.
-That’s about right. Not exactly the way I had planned things.
-Well, make yourself at home
-Thanks, I’ll have whatever you’re having.
-Here. What’s it like, being dead?
-I’m still learning. Not so very different I suppose, but not much in the way of earthly pleasures. 
-I suppose not. I did finally arrive at my own view of heaven you know.
-I’m not allowed to comment, David.
-I understand. But you see the problem for me was eternity. Just a long time sitting on a cloud, waiting for something to happen. And now, I think that heaven is just be the moment and it can only be a moment, when you have done it all; become all that you can be. All the false starts and mistakes that you made, and the others you didn’t; they all come together and you live through all of them, everything that happened and everything that might have or could have happened. You understand all the narratives that could have been you, or were you. Everything potential becomes actual. You live it backwards and forwards and sideways, in a moment and in eternity, because at that moment, time is meaningless.
-Some people say there are worlds where other yous are living those lives right now: who knows? In any case, you always lived half in your imagination, David. It’s one reason why I could never give up on you entirely. 
-But look at poor Matthew: he’s been paralysed all his life by the thought that everything he chooses to do means six less choices he has left. He wanted to save all his choices. It’s absurd, looking at life as if it was a magic lamp with a set number of wishes inside. I’ve told him so many times that in the end, if you go that way, you do nothing at all. At least I always knew that you have to spend yourself on something. No good being a miser of life. But then your life fails, and what do you do then?
-How should I know? You carry on, I suppose. You know what Hawkins will do to that poor man, don’t you?
-Yes. Another of my crimes. I thought it would be worth it if I could make it those last few steps up the ladder. I could do good things that would outweigh the bad. But then I found out that the ladder ends closer to the ground than I’d planned. No good trying to call off Hawkins, he’s got a personal involvement. 
-That’s right. But you never thought the story would have a happy ending did you? You know what they say about political careers ending in failure. They all do.
-I didn’t expect that the end for me would come so soon. 
-Don’t worry about it. All lives of whatever kind end in failure when you think about it. Your heart stops, or a disease kills you, or you are run down by a car. That’s why people are so suspicious of happy endings. They’re unrealistic. In any case you’re not finished yet, unlike me. There are lots of things you can do.
-I don’t see how.
Albert laughed at him, but not in an unfriendly way.
-You don’t get any special wisdom, not being alive any more, he said. But I have noticed that endurance becomes the most important quality for most of us eventually.
-I don’t see how I can carry on. I’ve done bad things, wrong things, and it turns out that they were all for nothing.
 -You underestimate yourself David. Give it a month. You’ll have made up a new story of yourself. And what good would it do you if you couldn’t? There isn’t a way to make everything come out right for everyone.
-No?
-It isn’t that kind of world.
-David reflected that Albert wasn’t looking any older. Compared to me, he thought, I’m aging fast. It was good to see him, even so.
-I missed you, you know.
-We had our best times, here, I suppose. The most purposeful, even though I spent so much time talking about nothing.
-I suppose so, Matthew misses you as well.
-How is he?
-I’ll tell you. He said to me the other day that he’d decided, early on in life, that the world wasn’t going to change much in his lifetime and that he had better get used to it. And here we are, he told me; we’ve been through three or four wars, and we’re still fighting others. The Berlin wall came down and as soon as they were free to do so Europeans started slaughtering each other again. There’s still a world war going on in the African continent and no-one seems to know why. And we’ve started fighting over religion as well as resources. Meanwhile, as a species, humans are sacrificing their planet to assert the sacred right of every one of them to have their own television, car and refrigerator. He said he wished he’d been right about nothing much happening.
-It doesn’t sound like he’s changed much. But at least now you have a labour government 
-Very funny. He went on to say that clearly he had lived in momentous times, but that, looking back, it felt like everything had happened somewhere else, as if it had never really involved him at all.
-He always did prefer to live inside himself
-But not me. I’ve always tried to be involved. I wanted to be at the heart of everything. And yet I knew just what he meant. All my own plans and struggles, don’t seem to make any difference to all of it; to everything that is going on
-You wanted to make a difference
-Or maybe I just wanted everyone to look at me, or to make up for the bad I know that´s in me. I suppose I’ll never know now whether my intentions were really good.
-Do you suppose that anyone ever knows that for sure about themselves?
David was quiet for a moment, collecting his thoughts.
-Back to Matthew though. His case is curious. Would you believe that he is happy? He doesn’t even know it himself. I suppose he stopped thinking about happiness a long time ago. But it’s true.
-I’m glad to hear it. How did this come about?
-I think that he forgot about himself. When we talk now, he’s more interested in the things he can see with his own eyes, and touch, and feel, and what people around him have to say. He doesn’t seem to worry so much about what it all implies for him.
-Not so unusual I’m afraid. Intellectual curiosity recedes with hairline, and the next meal you eat becomes more interesting than the next book you read. 
-I don’t think it’s that. Well a little, maybe. His mother would put it more simply: she’d say he found ways to make himself useful. 
Albert nodded.
-For myself, I should have liked to see what comes next. Everything must collapse. I still believe that. It should have started when the Wall came down. Capitalism and communism were like two dinosaur fossils supporting one another’s weight. You’d have thought that when one went over the other would topple straight away, but it seems locked in position still. It’s only a question of time. And something new will emerge from the ruins. You can’t stop it David, you can only make things a little better or a little worse in the tiny space where you happen to live. How is your life these days?
-I’ll be alright I expect. I am feeling better for this conversation, though I don’t know why. You never did say anything that was particularly comforting. Our drinks are done, and I suppose you have to be going. Drop by any time though; it will be nice to see you.
-Here are some words of comfort; remember I told you before. Great men looking back always imagine that their success was inevitable, only because they can’t see the thousands who were exactly like them but failed. 
Albert rose from the favoured chair and turned away from David. Then he stopped and turned back.
-It doesn´t really matter I suppose, but you can tell me now David. You remember the car?
-What car?
-You know the one I mean. The one Tim was driving that night. The old lady, the one you said I must have imagined. The one we hit. You saw her too, didn´t you?
David said nothing. He looked away; closed book in one hand, whisky glass in the other.
-It´s alright, you don´t have to answer. I´ll show myself out.

***

This is how Matthew’s happiness started.
For Jane and Matthew, the holiday did not begin well, though the weather was good. A long weekend in a holiday village had seemed like a good way for them all to get to know each other. Places like this were springing up all over the country. Getting there would be easy, you could drive, and then you had your own chalet, which meant privacy. If Jason became difficult, they would be able to manage without the added embarrassment of indignant staff or concerned onlookers.
On the drive, the boy seemed happy enough at first, but Matthew knew from the little time he’d spent with Jason that this could change very quickly. He felt a little guilty at knowing next to nothing about Jason’s condition. He could have read up on it easily enough, but that would have been like acknowledging some kind of obligation; taking on responsibility. Jason really was not his problem. In any case the boy’s mood was volatile, that much was clear. 
The rare incidence of sunshine on a public holiday had enticed legions of drivers out on to the English country roads for the weekend. Matthew occupied himself with mental arithmetic, revising their estimated time of arrival as the clock ticked by and they made little progress. He should have allowed more time. Why do they do it to themselves, he wondered; all these people in cars? They know it will be hell. Matthew had always made a point of not leaving the house on bank holidays for that reason, yet today here he was, along with all the rest. 
There were not many days when Jane could get away from her job. She was not in a position to argue about leave, given all the days she had to take off unexpectedly when there was a problem with Jason. 
Poor Jane; she looked exhausted. He knew that for her, it was enough to get away for a few days, anywhere. She’d been looking forward so much to this rather pathetic break. How she kept as cheerful as she did, he couldn’t imagine. Sometimes from the corner of his eye, he caught that sad, hopeful expression on her face that he remembered from their first meeting. He’d seen her looking at Jason sometimes in that same way. 
Jason didn’t have any concept of time or distance, Matthew supposed. Once he decided that it was time they should have arrived, or became bored, the trouble would start. They should have set off at first light, before the roads became filled up, when the boy might have slept. Now Jason was counting the number of red cars against the number of blue cars. He would shout out the numbers in a loud, happy voice it made you wince to hear. He kept losing count and having to start again. His voice was a high pitched, sing-song: the consonants were difficult to make out. Most of the cars that were red or blue attracted a comment as well as a number. Some of the comments were quite funny, in a childish way, when Matthew could understand them.
-Whanther Top, Jason announced suddenly.
-Does he say he wants to stop? Jane nodded. Matthew replied, we are stopped Jason, we haven’t moved in five minutes
Jason repeated his request.
-We can’t stop here, it’s not allowed. This is a motorway. You can only stop if there is a real emergency. 
Matthew felt foolish speaking so slowly and exaggerating the sounds.
-Feel thick
-He gets travel sickness sometimes. 
-But we’re not travelling Jane, we haven’t moved two miles in the last half hour. You can walk quicker than that.
-Feel thick, Jason repeated. 
This announcement was followed by the sounds that Matthew was dreading, as Jason began retching long and noisily. When he’d finished, he began to cry. 
-It’s alright Jason, it’s not your fault, don’t be upset, Jane was saying. 
He’s not upset because he thinks he’s done anything wrong, Matthew thought. Probably he’s just uncomfortable and his throat hurts. Jane caught his expression. 
-I blame myself, she said. We should have put him in the front seat, next to you, like he wanted. He doesn’t get sick in the front seat. 
She found some wipes, unfastened her safety belt and clambered into the back of the car. Even in these circumstances, Matthew found time to appreciate how well she fit into her tight jeans. 
-It’s not too bad, I expect, he told Jane. Leather seats you know, not so easy to stain.
New, top of the range, leather seats. 
They were late arriving, naturally, and in the office the bored staff wanted to make something of it. Matthew managed to keep his temper, barely.
-Look, if we arrived early demanding the keys, I could see your problem, but what difference does it make if we’re late? Just means you’ve had more time to get the place ready. 
Apparently it wasn’t that simple. Don’t raise your voice, he reminded himself, you’ll make Jason nervous, and then he could start to be frightened, and then he could start to decide he wants to go home. 
When they finally had the keys, and found their chalet, in the dark, Matthew realized that he was holding his breath on the threshold.  What would Jason think of the place?
Jason loved the television set. It was bigger than the one at home and really thin. When he found there was another TV in his own special bedroom, he was beyond happy. Jane made something for them to eat: something simple for them and burgers for Jason. The boy could certainly eat, and throwing up had done nothing to spoil his appetite.
Later on, when they were sure that he was asleep, Matthew and Jane made fierce, hushed love in the main bedroom, listening all the while for noises from the other bedroom that might suggest Jason was moving about. 
Matthew loved to watch Jane in the mornings. She was so focussed on what she was doing, unconscious of her appearance, while he was only sleepy. Jason demanded and ate a huge cooked breakfast, while Matthew drank some coffee and watched Jane some more. As soon as he’d finished eating, Jason wanted to go to the water play park, which they had told him so much about.
Matthew told him he would have to wait; he’d just finished his breakfast. Did he want to be sick again? Jason began to cry, Jane intervened to calm Jason down. The two of them went for a walk around the site while Matthew stayed behind, claiming that he needed to finish some work he’d brought with him. He lay on the bed for an hour, thinking about Amy and wondering what he had done with his life and where it would lead. 
In the afternoon they all went to the water park. Jason said that he loved it so much that one day he was going to come back and live there.
In bed that night, they found some time to speak, but they needed few words. What he found strange about Jane: in the daytime she was so positive and confident; managing Jason so cleverly, always ready to tear into anything or anyone that might threaten him. In the night she made love with passionate absorption, wordless and concentrated. But when they were lying together, naked, afterwards, she held on to him, timid and vulnerable as a small bird.
Jane was not much shorter than Matthew. She was thin, verging on skinny, but she had good strong hands with a firm grip that fit with the determined expression she showed the world, except when she got that sad, hopeful look. 
The next day was a disaster. The hospital called about Jane’s father, and the news was not good. 
-They say that he’s had a stroke, almost certainly more than one. They say he might not last the day.
-You have to go, of course. There was nothing else Matthew could say.
-Jason?
-We’ll be alright, really. I’ll look after him and he can look after me. There’s plenty to keep him busy here. 
-He likes you, Matt. 
There was no reply for Matthew to make to that. 
For a few hours after she was gone, Jason was fine with the television. Then he started to mind that Jane was not there. Matthew tried to divert him with food. There was a takeaway service on the site that looked like being more fun than cooking. Matthew considered himself reasonably at home in a kitchen, but he was not enthusiastic to tackle the various kinds of fried food that seemed to interest Jason.
Jason was excited about the takeaway, but when it arrived there was a problem. The fries were not the same as the fries he was used to at home, and he couldn’t eat them. Matthew started to argue, but realized that it would be much easier to bake some of the oven chips that Jane had brought with them in bulk, anticipating this difficulty. After lunch, Jason had a nap and Matthew had a beer. 
Next would be the water play area; he knew that. Matthew found the prospect simply frightening. He managed to get Jason there and changed without too many problems. The boy was so excited that he was gurgling rather than speaking. Matthew decided that the sounds were a form of laughter. 
Once released, Jason ran at the slides, at the pool, at the special lagoon where the current washed you around in a great loop. He wanted to do everything at once, again and again. Mostly Matthew just stood and watched.
What could he have been thinking of, he wondered? He’d left Amy; he’d done that to himself, and he still couldn’t explain why. He’d broken her heart as well as wrecking his own life and he would always have to live with that. 
Worse, he’d jumped straight into bed with this woman he hardly knew, who had an idiot child in tow. Idiot was the wrong word to use, needlessly cruel, but he didn’t know the right word. Why not? He was supposed to be the clever one. The truth was that Matthew was the idiot, to have put himself in this position. 
Of course, he and Jane had made no promises to each other, it was all supposed to be low key, but it was him who had suggested that they share time together with Jason. In any case Matthew had spent enough time with women who had issues over the years. He should know by now that there was no such thing as no promises. 
Just friends though, we agreed that. She said she understood that it was too soon after the other thing for me to be more than that to anyone. 
Say what you like to yourself, but you know that somewhere in her there’s hope growing that you have to crush. The sooner the better, it hurts less. I’m not a saint he thought; never have pretended to be. I’m not the right person for this situation. I’m cold and stiff and I look at the world with my brain not my heart. And what good is a brain for dealing with Jason? The most stupid thing he could have done was to suggest this trip in the first place. 
The thoughts went round his head, panic and self-loathing chasing each other in ever faster spirals. He reminded himself to keep an eye on the boy, in case things should get even worse. 

Matthew was not really worried about Jason being safe. The place was designed for kids and the boy was robust enough. He could even swim a little, in an ungainly, splashy way, which seemed to delight him; keeping afloat well enough without achieving much in the way of forward motion. 
It was the other kids who caused Matthew concern. They seemed harmless enough: mostly they were concentrating on enjoying themselves, accompanied by parents, or in small groups. It was just that Jason was so loud, so full of laughter, enjoying himself so much in his animal way. He was bound to attract attention. And he was odd to look at. The children would notice that right away. They would have a word for it; not one of the words he remembered from the playground, but something like that; probably something even more cruel. 
Matthew watched Jason splashing, oblivious to everything but the intense joy of the moment, and all he could think of was how quickly that could change, how easy it would be for someone, maybe even without meaning anything by it, to shatter that glee and turn it into something else: fear, pain, confusion, humiliation. And children were cruel, everyone knew that. Well the first little bastard who tried to be clever had better watch out. 
-You look very therioush, Mayou. Jason paused in the middle of his curious, wobbly run to treat Matthew to a huge grin. You need to have more thfun.
And with that he was away again. I suppose he’s right, Matthew thought; if only life were that simple. 
Contrary to his expectation, none of the children showed any inclination to be unpleasant to Jason, even after he approached some of them to organize a game. They allowed him to order them around; laughing at the increasingly chaotic instructions he issued, but playing along; some of the older kids reassuring the others that it was okay. It went on until Jason himself collapsed in a fit of giggles. 
Matthew was watching from the side, wondering how he could possibly get himself and Jason changed back into street clothes when the boy was so excited. He looked at his watch. 
-You’re the father of that poor boy aren’t you?
A lady reclining in a sun lounger was talking to him. 
-Er, yes.
Was she going to accuse Jason of making a disturbance?
-Looks like he’s really enjoying himself. But it must be hard for you. Bad enough with our two who, er, don’t have problems. I’m sorry that sounds very clumsy. That’s my husband with our kids over there look. 
Her smile was slightly shy.
-If you are thinking about how to get away, now is not such a bad time. The changing area gets a bit busy later. 
-Yes I was wondering how I would manage it.
-You sneak off now and get yourself changed first. We’ll keep an eye on him for you. If he notices you are gone and gets upset Jeff can bring him in to the changing area.
-Thank you. Thanks very much.
Everything went smoothly. It was only afterwards that Matthew thought he should have asked the names of the helpful couple. Arriving back at the chalet finally, Matthew was thinking; in some dumb kind of way, I actually enjoyed today.
Normally Jason went to bed early. He slept a lot. He liked to sleep, and to eat, and to watch television. He said these were his three favourite things. He knew all the characters of every soap opera, even if he confused them occasionally. He would demand to be given summaries of the storylines, and he corrected any inaccuracies with pedantic insistence. Matthew never saw any of these programmes and was hopeless at the game, but Jason showed amused tolerance of his ignorance. 
On this night, Jason decided that his best pyjamas had been left behind. He couldn’t sleep. He wouldn’t sleep. Matthew supposed that really he was missing Jane, though he didn’t say so. Eventually exhaustion overcame him as he was watching one of the DVD’s that he knew off by heart. 
How did people cope before television, thought Matthew? It was a stupid question, but that was what he had been reduced to. He would be happy to watch an episode of a soap himself right now, if he could have beer to go with it. 
Jane arrived back early the next morning, as it was getting light. Her father had survived, but he was not thought likely to improve much. Jason was quiet and well behaved. They made another visit to the pool. Jason ordered pizza with flat sausage for his tea. He was asleep by seven in the evening. 
-Home tomorrow, Jane smiled. I’m sorry it’s been like this, but without you I don’t know what I would have done. Thank you, for everything. It must have been horrible for you. Not what you expected. 
-I didn’t know what to expect. Anyway you had all the extra driving and stress. It’s not as if we could have planned for this.
You have to tell her now, he was thinking, before she starts to talk about what we should do next weekend and how cute the boy is. 
-Jason asked me to tell you how much he enjoyed himself. He likes you. I like you. We’ll get over it I suppose. 
Oh god, here it comes. Don’t get into this. No-one promised anything. It was just going to be a fun weekend and no obligations either way. Don’t start feeling guilty, especially not because of what Amy said. It’s nothing to do with Amy and she knew nothing about this situation. Kindest is to kill this right now, before anyone gets their hopes up. 
-Matt, what’s wrong? You look as sick as Jason did in the car. I only said thank you, for both of us. It’s been a really nice break for us and you’ve been very good about everything. I guess we both know what comes next, so let’s just shake hands, yes?
-What do you mean, shake?
-Shake hands, no hard feelings. I get it.
-You get what?
-Look Matt, I’m not an idiot and your face couldn’t be easier to read. It didn’t turn out like you thought and that’s no one’s fault so leave it at that. We said low key from the start; this was always going to be too much of a shock for you. I’ve been through it all before. I don’t mind, really. I just don’t want us to go through explanations and justifications. I can’t do that side of it any more.
-You’re dumping me.
-Of course not, I’m just trying to save you the trouble of dumping me.
-You’re dumping me because you have a handicapped son.
-Jason´s not my son.
-What?
-I never said he was. I just said he was Jason and you never asked. You never asked what his condition was either – it´s Downs´ syndrome. Jason is my brother. My parents were old when they had him and then my mum died, and dad lost his mind. Dad´s in one of those homes where they just sit all day, in the same chair. So I had to choose. I couldn´t look after both of them. And you didn´t ask about any of this which is why I know you aren´t planning on staying around.
Matthew was shaking:
-You’re right. I’m no good to anyone. I don´t consider other people and I pretend that´s ok because I care about people in general. You´d be better off to dump me. But please Jane, think about. Why not give us a chance?
Jane stepped back from him for a moment. She seemed to be evaluating something.
-Are you sure of what you’re saying Matthew? Don’t think I don’t see you or that you’ve swept me off my feet. Some of the things you do and say, I could punch you in the face. But then I see you with Jason, reaching out to him, and the way he looks at you, and I know there is something better in you. If only you can find it in yourself.
They kissed. Jane looked at him.
-Admit it though, just now, you were thinking how to tell me that it was finished.
-I don´t know what I was going to say, Matthew replied, realising that it was true. 
For some reason they both started crying.
-Do you think we will be alright? Matthew asked.
Matthew, that´s just the kind of stupid question you would ask. Let’s not talk just now. We can go to bed instead and after you can tell me about your day with Jason. We´ll take one step at a time from there. 

Chapter Fifteen

Matthew was spending some time talking to David’s family and friends and writing up what they had to say. David had asked him to do it: he described the work as helping him to put together what he called a personal memoir, and he insisted on paying Matthew for his time. Matthew claimed that he was being pressed to commit biography. They laughed at that, but Matthew supposed that it was true. David had always had it in his mind that at some stage he would leave a record for whatever posterity awaited him, but these days it was obvious that there would be no call for a published biography: knowing that made the task a little sad.
At least Matthew gained the opportunity to meet David’s father again, after many years. Matthew was surprised to hear that the old man was prepared to help with the project. To have your life story written up was an enterprise that was likely to strike the older Mr Thomas as more than a little self regarding, even if David insisted that it was only intended for family. It seemed that the old man had mellowed with age. He might even relish the chance to go over some of the old family stories. Matthew looked forward to hearing what he would have to say.
But the father still wasn’t one for tall tales and anecdotes. The plain truth had always served him. He was more interested to hear what Matthew had to say about his own life and the world in general. He was still active, and bright enough, though slightly deaf and short in his answers, a man rooted in the external world, even as the external world was falling away from him. It was not difficult to imagine the difficult times that father and son must have had when the boy was growing up. 
Unlike Matthew’s own parent, Mr Thomas had moved in his retirement. He lived at the coast, within easy reach of the moors, his small modern flat not actually in sight of the sea, but a short walk away from it. When Matthew visited, it was a typical day on the northern shore, the wind driving in a fine rain and the sea and shore merging in shades of grey light. There was an austere grandeur about it that was at odds with the neat little housing development with its bungalows and cul de sac. Matthew would have preferred to find an old fisherman’s cottage in an idyllic hamlet, but then he did not have to live there. He could understand how the combination of nature outside, and practical comfort inside, would appeal to the old man. 
In the house, he was surprised to see quite a lot of family clutter: framed photographs of Mr Thomas’s family, and his brother’s family, at various stages in their lives. Getting him to explain who they were and how they were related was useful background for Matthew. He suspected that David himself was unaware of some of the relationships. There were hand-made objects too: small crafted items that Mr Thomas had made years ago, bits and pieces that held memories that he was willing enough to share, in his matter of fact way. 
Eventually Matthew came to his subject.
-What was he like as a young child?
-I don’t know how you’d describe something like that. He was a good boy, did as he was told mostly and didn’t get into trouble. Like most children I suppose.
-Did you think he was at all extraordinary?
-Well he was always bright enough. Clever at school compared to his brother and sister. Although his report books said he was lazy. In the family, I suppose his cleverness was exaggerated. We didn’t really have a history of formal education on either side. David being the eldest made it harder for his brother at the school: the teachers expected a bit much of the younger one after they’d been teaching the elder. That seemed a bit unthinking to me. He’s fine now though, Jack I mean: got a nice wife and two kids, living locally so I see a bit of them. Wish we saw more of David, but he’s so busy of course.
-His mother died young.
-My Evelyn you mean. That she did. That was a loss it took me a long time to get over. I was angry with the world. I think that made me a bad father at least for a time. I worry about that still, sometimes. It was a difficult age for the kids, but then, when isn’t it? I can be thankful they turned out so well.
-Can you recall how David took it … his mother dying?
-I remember him being upset. He was the eldest and the most quiet. His sister, she was very young, she went through a phase of eating dirt, soil from the garden I mean. Hard to understand that isn’t it? David didn’t say that much as I remember. He bunked off school a bit and we had words about it, but some kids go through a truant phase whether there are problems at home or not. It was Anne we had the most difficulty with. She’s gone to live down London now.
-Do you remember a time when you rented a cottage in the hills, and he became lost one day? That’s something he still talks about now and then. 
-You’ve got me there: let me think. Wait there was something like that, so long ago. David would have been about sixteen. We rented the place with my brother, for a fortnight.
-Go on
-Not much to tell. I remember David thought he was getting too old to be on family holidays with us, he spent a lot of time on his own. Me and my brother, we like hiking, still do, when we can manage it. Have to be careful not to overdo it now though. You hear of too many people dropping dead on the high fells, old ones like me and him I mean.
-But you’re right, something did happen. David had gone off on his own and young Jack, well he was always influenced by what David did. So on that day he decided to take himself off on his own as well. Never said anything to us. Of course I wouldn’t have allowed it, too dangerous up there. David was older, and he was always the sensible one anyway, but Jack, no. Anyway, he took himself off and we didn’t know where. Me and Peter, we’d already gone out walking with the other kids, so there was just my sister in law at the house, and David I suppose. Jack didn’t come back until after it was dark, we were worried sick, went out looking for him ourselves with torches. I remember it was a very dark night. Then he just arrived, looking none the worse, though he was soaking and freezing. He spent the next few days in bed as I remember. 
-I’m a little confused Mr Thomas. Are you sure you have it quite right? Wasn’t it David who was lost?
-Not as I remember. In fact, now you mention it, David was put in a state by the whole thing, seemed to blame himself; I suppose because he thought Jack was following his example. All the time Jack was in bed recovering, David stayed with him, checking that he was alright and talking to him. They were close in those days, more so than now. Time pushes people in different directions of course. But I’d forgotten all about that episode until now.

***

The congregation was not so large as it used to be, but the choir and the organ could still fill the vaulted space with a mighty reverberation that left you feeling part of something bigger than yourself. It was the emotion that Patricia had used to describe to herself as holy when she was a child. Even now she found a little comforting envelope for her existence during the service. It was only that now, once the service was over, the feeling was quickly gone leaving no comforting glow behind. 
And she was annoyed at David. These days, if she came to mass at all, she preferred to sit near the back of the church; not so much to be self effacing as to stay at one remove from the proceedings. All magic worked better when you glimpsed at it from a distance, without the close up human detail. Even the words sounded better after distance and echo had drained some of the commonplace out of them. But no; David had to be up at the front, on display, in the biggest church in the city, sitting there with a big silly smile on his face like some thirteen year old girl waiting to receive first communion. 
Patricia had feared that little Evelyn would find it all intimidating, but there she sat between her parents, eyes fixed on her beloved father, the two of them making a picture of family devotion that somehow shut out Patricia herself. 
And David really was waiting for his first communion: he´d been baptized and confirmed in an Anglican church; only as a matter of form, in a family that was not much troubled by religion. The priest had been very regretful, clearly not wishing to offend, but he advised them in the strange formulaic language they all used that it would not be in order for David to take the sacrament until he was formally received into the Church. Patricia thought it was pathetic the way they sucked up to David, as if it was such a big deal for them to have a man like him accept the true faith. For now at least, he would have to watch from the stalls. Patricia didn´t take communion either. It had been a while since her last confession. 
David was happy. It was a calm and satisfying happiness that washed over him as the service proceeded in its unhurried way, cleaning out his thoughts.  All the more so, when he could sit conscious of his wife and his beautiful daughter at his side. He could sense that Patricia was a little tense. Probably she had an unconscious sensation that David was taking over something that had been private in her own life. Soon she would realize how perfect it was that they could share this great thing in their lives. Meanwhile he should be careful not to seem too enthusiastic; not like the person who gives up smoking and then immediately wants everyone else to stop. Quietly they would approach the state of grace together, with Evelyn at their side. This is what I was lacking for so long, he thought.
They came to the Agnus Dei, asking the Lamb of God for mercy. Words polished smooth by the centuries but still filled with a great beauty, to David´s ears. Patricia heard the same music and felt the same need of mercy, but when it came to the plea for god to grant his peace, the request seemed to her only ironic. The church gave her no peace. 
She´d had all the chances she needed to tell someone what she knew. She regarded the priest as a dull, unimaginative man with a too literal view in matters of conscience. But these days David was having private audiences with all manner of clergy. It was part of his preparation to make his commitment of faith, but also Patricia suspected because he wanted to do more than simply join the congregation. It was the ambition coming through. He couldn’t help himself. She could have talked to any of these clerics about the case of the abused child and the priest who was shipped back to Ireland. David had positively encouraged her to join him in the meetings, and surely not all of them would be men who would tell her that god moved in mysterious ways and urge her to be resigned to events.
But she couldn´t bring herself to do it. It was that she didn’t know what she wanted to be done; or the fear of failing to convince others of what she had discovered; or worse, finding out that they already knew and had failed to act. In any case it was cowardice of one kind or another. And it set her apart from the other people in this building, singing in praise of god; and from the honest sincere faces she thought she saw around her, and even from her own family.

The last time that Matthew met Amy, a long time after their separation, came about by chance, almost. She was due to receive a business award that was sponsored and reported on by the paper, and Matthew went along to write the story. At the dinner they sat at separate tables. The bumped into each other later on, in the bar. 
-I couldn’t eat anything, knowing that you were in the room.
-Me neither. They tell me the food wasn’t up to much anyway. You’re looking great Matt. 
-You too. No, I mean, you. I’m looking old, but it’s okay, I am old, getting there anyway. Starting to feel it too. You know the way it goes with men: they don’t age so much year to year. You think the years are not really showing and then one morning you look in the mirror, bang there’s another decade gone.
-Never mind, you are decaying splendidly, very distinguished.
-In this light maybe
The pause was uncomfortable.
-How is Jane?
-She’s fine. Fine. How is…
-Geoffrey: he’s well. Hale and hearty you would say, in a sarcastic tone of voice no doubt. Don’t pretend; you never did like him.
-It’s not that. I just thought that he… well never mind.
-And Jason?
-He’s doing well. Very well. We got him into a new school you know, and it’s made such a difference. He’s such a happy kid, so affectionate. 
Jason was the safe subject they could talk about, but as Matthew spoke unselfconsciously about the problems they had experienced, and how they had tried to solve them, and just how the boy spent his days and what gave him pleasure, Amy started to relax and smile a little more. 
It was the old smile. Lips a little thinner and a few more wrinkles, but the same, more beautiful than ever. Matthew told her so. 
-You’ve changed Matt. You’ve grown I think.
-I was always more lucky than I deserved. Jane’s been good for me. And Jason gives me more than I’ve given him. That’s one of those stupid things that people say, but it’s true.
 -Still, it must have been hard at first. You weren’t used to anyone relying on you, I remember.
-I admit it. I was too wrapped up in myself all the time. You cured me of that Amy, whatever else happened between us, you taught me how to live in the world, with other people. An old friend of mine once said that we only find ourselves outside of ourselves. I thought it was just a phrase he made up to sound clever. You know any fool can spout a paradox as if it were profound. But now I believe it really meant something.
She was still smiling, but there was a tear rolling down her cheek.
-Amy you’re crying. Let me get you something. 
-It’s all right. I’m not sure what I’m crying for really. Anyway it was nice to see you.
-Good to see you too. Maybe sometime…
And then, Amy was gone to the ladies room, napkin pressed to her face.

Matthew still saw Patricia often, though the sexual side of their relationship was long past. Lunchtime meetings were a semi official engagement that they kept up more as a matter of habit than because they had a lot to say to each other. There was always news to catch up on though, and in some ways Matthew remained a confessor figure for Patricia: not that he’d ever applied for or wanted the role. 
-I had a strange phone call yesterday, she was telling him. From an old friend I suppose; well an old client actually. I didn’t remember him at all at first, but you know how it is, you let them run on and eventually there is some clue and the memory clicks into place. He told me his real name, but everyone just used to call him Raj. Used to be one of my regulars when I was doing criminal trials, him and his friend, small time burglars. Kept getting caught, like they all do.
 -Why was he ringing you?
-Like I said, it was a strange call. He was talking to me as if we’d had some kind of thing going on. At first I was concerned that he was going to ask me out, or worse ask that I give him some professional help without paying. Anyway he insisted that he had left that criminal life behind him and that he was now completely legitimate, well mostly legitimate, and doing quite well. He told me he didn’t see Pete, yes that was the name of the partner, any more and that Pete was never going to change. But he wasn’t calling me to speak about that. It was about his brother.
-Pete’s brother?
-No you idiot, his own brother. It seems that this brother is a lot younger than him and still lives at home. They live quite near to your mother’s place. Raj was always the black sheep he said; I think he meant it to be funny. He said the young boy has always been very well behaved, very studious, respectful to his parents.
-And now he’s going off the rails?
-No, it’s more interesting than that. Raj says he’s become very religious, but in an obsessive way. He only wants to talk to people who have the same ideas as him. He’s even been overseas to study these ideas at a special school. Raj doesn’t think it’s healthy.
-What do the parents think about it?
-Raj says they are fairly traditional themselves, but nothing like the brother. He said they seemed pleased that the boy is going through this intense period of finding his faith; it means he’s not turning his back on his culture. They expect that the obsessive side will settle down in time. But Raj says that his parents have never had any idea of what the boys are really up to, and he should know.
-So, what did he want you to do?
-I really don’t know. I don’t know if he knew himself. It was almost like he thought of me as someone who was official, but someone he could trust. I think in his mind we’re all just the authorities. The powers that be. No difference between the police, the screws, the magistrates and the judges. He feels that he’s let the establishment know by talking to me. He must really be worried to call me up after all this time, but I can’t think of anything I should do about it. Perhaps I should call the police and report an outbreak of religious faith on the south side of the city.
-Maybe it was just an excuse to contact you again.
-He did have a thing for me.
-I’m sure they all did
-You don’t have to be quite so obvious about using the past tense Matt.
-Sorry.
Both of them seemed oddly discontented today. And the truth was that the restaurant had seen better days. The menu was tired. The over bright lighting exposed the sorry decline of the furnishings. Next time, he thought, they should arrange to meet somewhere else. Memories were all very well, but there were as many bad as good. 
-David won’t ever get the minister’s job, you know, Patricia told Matthew.
-What makes you say that?
-The moment has passed I think. He’s not such a good fit to the times any more.
She tasted her drink and made a face.
-I don’t know why I ordered this merlot. I hardly like the stuff at all anymore. In fact, I don’t like this place much. I don’t know why we have to meet here.
-We don’t have to meet at all, if you’d rather not.
-This town is all wine bars and fancy shops now, isn’t it? I wonder what is the least amount you need per year to live here these days. Must be a fortune. Do you remember when we were all first together here, how cheap everything was?
-Ugly though. Don’t you think it’s better now?
-Yes I suppose. I miss something though, not just my young self. I’d rather be young then than now. I couldn’t be doing with all that makeup they have to wear now for one thing, and going to noisy bars where you can’t speak, just to drink and be looked at. And I wouldn’t have looked good in the clothes they wear now. Too sexy for me. 
-You were very good looking.
-I was pretty enough, in a plain sort of way. Do you want coffee?
She rested her hand lightly on his:
-Matt, you’re brooding about something.
-I think I’m going to chuck my job
-That’s silly, whatever else would you do?
-I could… anyway; it’s not for me, really. It never was. I’m not worldly enough to be a journalist.
-What a strange thing to say.
-And I had no business giving your husband information about Mitchell Walcott. It was a breach of confidence.
-David will make everything right.
-Oh, I know, it will be fine. It’s just, that’s not what you do.
-But that’s not the reason you’re thinking of leaving.
-No, but what about you?
Patricia fidgeted with her lighter, feeling the need for a cigarette. She’d started smoking again after twenty years, how stupid was that? And now it turned out there was practically nowhere left you were allowed to smoke.
-I’m thinking I’ll probably leave David. Don’t panic, it has nothing to do with you, or anyone else. 
-Is it because of his affair?
-What a curious thing to say. I’d almost forgotten about that.
-You were hurt at the time.
-I dare say I was, but no, not that. I’m not such a romantic. I think that in some ways Matthew, between the two of us, you are more the woman and I am more the man.
-You work in a male dominated world I suppose
-Do I? I’m not sure. You know, there are more women lawyers than men now. Of course the men hold all the top jobs so in that sense you are right. That was one reason I almost accepted when they asked me to be a judge, but I suppose that is one more thing I shall never do now. No regrets there though, I’d rather stay a nuisance than have the responsibility for making decisions.
-So what is the problem? 
-Does disappointment need a reason? I don’t know. I suppose there should be more, that’s all. David still believes he loves me, but he hardly notices I’m there. I thought having Evelyn would make a difference.
-David adores Evelyn
-I meant a difference in the way he feels about me. If anything, she gets the attention now and I’m more surplus to requirements that ever.
-That’s stupid, David needs you.
-Jane needs you a lot more than David needs me.
-I need her too.
-Yes I think that is true
Matthew was strangely reluctant to talk about Jane and Jason with Patricia. He could see that she felt it. He could ramble on forever about what they had been doing together, where they had been, what plans they had. Some part of him was thinking about Jane and the child now. But the tone of what he would say seemed out of place here. Perhaps he felt a little guilty about what he knew was his good fortune. Dissatisfaction and disappointment had always been what brought Patricia and him together. Somehow it was a betrayal on his part that he had escaped from them. Even the problems at work were not weighing on him like, perhaps, they should.
Matthew thought some more.
-You won’t leave David, he decided.
-You may be right. But you know what’s funny? When we got married, I was worried that we were too young. We might grow in different directions and come to despise each other. But David persuaded me: he said we’d live our lives as one. We’d always be together and we’d go through the same changes together. And after, we’d have it all to look back on together.
-I remember I raised similar concerns about the two of you. 
-He told me that. He said it was none of your business. But even though he’s been absent, one way or another, for so much of the time, you know he was right. We have always spent a little time together, and we are still friends. It’s just the sex. He’s not interested, or he’s got no time for it. It’s not that I’m getting old, even though that’s true. Looking back, I think we’ve been that way always. Apart from right at the start. It was a relief to me in a way, when he fell for that stupid girl. It showed he was, well, normal. I suppose you knew all about that?
-Yes; he told me everything, whether I wanted to know or not, and later I found out that he confessed to you. But it seemed cruel and pointless to let you know that I knew.
-It hardly matters now, does it? But back in the beginning, all that concern about whether we would have anything to say to each other, and the problem turned out to be not that at all, but something I never even considered.
-Is it a big problem?
-You know I have a practical nature. I’ve had my lovers. You’ve got your own girl now, so you’re out of the picture. That’s ancient history. The main thing is; I have to be discreet. I could never be with someone who wants to run away with me, and that makes it all a little sad and pathetic. I manage.
-But you don’t sound content. Is it guilt?
-Why should I feel guilty? I want to stay married to my husband, and there’s no other way to do it. It’s just as I get older, I get more frightened. I’m not so bad just now, for my age, but you know, gravity wins in the end. What happens when I can’t find a man who wants to take me to bed? I can’t imagine how I shall cope. 
-That time is years from now. David will be finished in his work by then. He’ll probably be more, you know, interested.
-It will come sooner than you think, Matt. It’s the real curse of women to live longer, but age younger. Anyway, I wouldn’t want David to change now. The pattern of our lives is set. It would feel too weird. Maybe even five years ago: but now, I don’t want him in that way. And I can’t face being old and alone in this way. It makes me want to scream. 
Matthew had no reply for this, and they sat in silence for a while.
-I can’t stay long. I have a conference in chambers this afternoon, Patricia said.
-Let’s walk back together. We should get out of here anyway. The sun is shining outside. We’ll walk along the river.
Patricia decided she did not want to finish her wine and summoned the waiter. She paid the bill with her card. My turn, she smiled.
There was a vacant bench next to the water, where they sat. The day was cold but bright. The riverside walk was one of those carefully planned city environments: all tastefully modern stone harmonized with what they called heritage features. Over the years the appearance of the place had improved beyond measure, even if the river was still dirty. Something besides money had been spent to pay for it though. Matthew imagined that you could read the cost in the eyes of the worker drones buzzing between their sanitized locations; office to wine bar, coffee shop, to flat. He was not immune himself.
 Patricia was staring at the water.
-Something else happened to me you know. I was going to a church. I was going to meet someone and tell them something important; it doesn’t matter why. But when I got there, I couldn’t go inside. And now I feel like I’m never going back there, like I’m through with all that. 
-You’re talking to the wrong person. You need a priest to help you with loss of faith: or David maybe. 
-Some days I feel like I’ve lost everything I cared about, and I’m just carrying on for the sake of it.
-You’ll always have Evelyn, he said.
-Yes, I’ll always have her. 
The words were unspoken, but Patricia could have confessed that, when Evelyn was a baby, she had never experienced the emotional attachment that was said to flood through new mothers. Waiting for that feeling, that never came, had left her terrified that she was some kind of monster. Now that Evelyn was talking, reaching an age of reason, her mother had developed a more genuine affection for her. She looked forward to her daughter being a young adult and the time they might spend together. But that was how fathers were supposed to feel. 
Maybe she was a kind of monster. David had spoken to Evelyn from the first days as if she was already grown up and could understand whatever he was saying, but he seemed perfectly natural about it. There was never any doubt of the bond between them.  Maybe Patricia would always be the outsider. 
She couldn’t say any of this to Matthew.
-What about you, Matt. Does it still bother you? About Evelyn.
-You know how I deal with things. Mostly I don’t think about it at all. 
-There are too many things you don’t think about and don’t notice. 
-These days I notice more. If you really want to know about it, the situation with Evelyn, well it broke my heart and for ages I never even knew it. But there´s no reason for it, and I don´t think of anyone as being to blame. There came a time when I finally admitted to myself that something inside me had been snapped, and that I wouldn’t be quite the same afterwards. Only now I think, maybe it was necessary for something that had to happen to me. Perhaps I have the kind of heart that has to be broken before it can be opened. 
-That sounds too sad. 
-I could be wrong. It’s a rule of life that other people know you better than you know yourself. That’s one of the reasons we need friends: to help us see ourselves.
-You know that David’s always been your best friend. He helped you in ways you don’t even know about. He knew you’d be too proud to let him. The two of you should have each other. Even if you do give up on the job, don’t give up on the friendship.
-I’ll bear your advice in mind. But you know I never really wanted to get on. I don’t know if you were talking about my promotion just now, but the fact is, if I hadn’t made editor, I wouldn’t be the one having to do the sackings now
-What sackings?
-The Examiner has new owners.
-They still need writers, I suppose.
-Apparently not; or not so many as you’d think anyway, and they have other titles so jobs can be consolidated. I’m going to have to manage that. I shall have to think of myself as a manager.
-But if you weren’t the editor, it would probably be you getting the push.
-True, but I think I could live with that more easily.
It was time to go, but it felt like the end of something. Matthew was groping for words that would sum up the something, but he could find none. 
-When I look back, he said, I always thought that writing for the paper was only a step on my way, even though I was too timid even to think about what the next step might be. I suppose it felt right because it was writing, of a kind. It was a craft anyway, something that you could take seriously even after you admitted the limits of it. Afterwards, well the next steps never turned up, and I decided that the craft was enough for me. But then somewhere along the line I lost even that consolation and it became just a job. Now, I go to work, just like everyone else.
-But everybody is like everyone else Matt: even David, as it turns out.
The point I’m trying to make is; work can’t save you, even though I hoped it might. And I never looked for love to save me. Deep down I don’t know if I even believed it really existed, except as a shared delusion. But now it seems to me that there is nothing else that holds things together. Without it I’d be lost entirely.

***

This is how the story ended for Mitchell Walcott. Ray Hawkins drove the taxi for a long time without speaking. He kept humming a tune to himself, which Walcott couldn´t help but find irritating even in his present situation. They left the city behind them and eventually turned off the main highway onto roads that were empty of traffic. Finally Hawkins took his gaze from the road for a moment and smiled pleasantly at Mitchell.
-You know why I’m here, I suppose?
-It was that man we saw, the first time I met you, the one you said was a policeman.
-You saw him again, didn’t you?
Mitchell nodded weakly
-And for that you’re going to kill me now.
-Nothing is that certain in life, but you should bear in mind that these doors are locked, so jumping out of a moving vehicle, which I would not advise anyone to try, is not an option. Also there is a weapon next to me here that is loaded and ready to fire and should you try to do anything really stupid it will put holes in you in really awkward places in a very short time. On the bright side, if that happens, the gun has a very good silencer, and the car is not mine so it won’t be me doing the cleaning up afterwards. 
Walcott did not reply.
-So for now, we still have a drive ahead of us- If you have no objection we could pass the time with me telling you a little story. Help you understand one or two things. 
He smiled again at Walcott, who could do no more than shrug.
-I’ll take that as a yes.
Hawkins drove on steadily towards the mountains which seemed a far away destination. Walcott guessed that they would arrive soon enough.
-You remember that last time we saw our friend; he was trying to persuade me to get something for him. I told you what it was but that probably meant nothing to you. Well, I’d told you before how I’d got to be friendly with some Irish lads, and that these lads had friends in other countries, who had need of some of the same kinds of stuff as them; weapons mostly, and explosives, I reckon you guessed that. They all had money, but not a ready supply of goods, which was where I could be helpful. It was all a long time ago.
-Now the policeman, he had my name and I don’t know how, though I suppose that with his job it was not so hard for him to find me; and in any case he got word to me that he wanted a meeting. Not so easy for me to say no to that, me being an upstanding businessman and all; but worrying for all sorts of reasons; which was why it was helpful to me when you came along to act as my associate. At least he agreed to meet in England. No way was I going over to his place. I wasn’t exactly expecting trouble that night, but it wouldn’t have surprised me either. 
-As you know, it turned out that he wasn’t interested in my business, just in getting hold of some explosives. The curious part of that is that he wanted to get hold of the type of explosives that the friends of my friends, from the north of Spain, like to use. And, what’s more curious; because I can never leave well enough alone, I did some research on this person before our meeting, and I discover that his policeman’s job is supposedly to track down and catch these friends of friends of mine. 
-So now you see it’s not really strange at all, and I imagine right away that his intention is to plant the explosive on some unfortunate person as evidence when he arrests or shoots them as a terrorist. So far so normal, but of course you know my opinion of police in general, so I had my mind made up from the off that I’ll be selling him nothing. But sometimes it’s best not to come out with these things in that blunt way, so I told him I would do my best. You know, stay polite, let him down gently. 
-Well as you will recall, this was one of those Spaniards who can’t keep his mouth shut, and he keeps on about his patriotic duty and saving the country, and his uncle who was not afraid to act to save the country and prison was his reward. And I have no idea what he’s talking about but I keep nodding and hoping he doesn’t start foaming at the mouth. 
-After the meeting; well I suppose I should have let it drop there, but I’m like the cat that died of curiosity. So I spoke to him a few times after, even met him again once, and did some digging on my own account. 
-It seems that our friend’s uncle was in a secret society back in the seventies. They called themselves the Allianza Apostolica Anticommunista if you can believe that: sounds more Italian comic opera than Spanish doesn’t it? Maybe they just wanted a name that would give three letters the same, like Klu Klux Klan. You can imagine what it was about: ultra religious, ultra Franquist and ultra reactionary. When Franco himself died in seventy five they all went a bit nuts. 
-And did what exactly?
-One of their stunts was at 55 Atocha Street, in Madrid. In January seventy seven our friend’s uncle and some of his pals marched into the national trades union offices, and started lining up against the wall anyone who was wearing a suit or looked like they might be important. They massacred those people and walked away. They didn’t expect to be chased and they weren’t. 
-What were they trying to achieve?
-Another civil war, I suppose: that’s how the fascists gained power in the first place. Unsettle the people and then everyone starts killing everyone else, until the army steps in for the good of all. In this case it was touch and go for a while, but I suppose the people on both sides weren’t really looking for another bloodbath just at that moment. They were still trying to get over their last civil war. 
-So just another bunch of extremists with crazy ideas you might think; but when you start to look at it with a professional eye, you notice some interesting things: like the weapons that were used; Ingham MAC10’s. That’s a machine pistol famous for the silencer that comes with it. Kind of ideal for the job, but not so easy to get hold of, except that for some reason units of the Spanish police were issued with them in those days. 
-Then again, the gentlemen responsible made no real effort to escape; they just walked away like Chicago gangsters who know they are protected. Our friend said they were heroes who were betrayed, and I guess they never expected to be arrested. It turned out that even though they were caught, two of the three main men managed to escape not many years after they were sentenced. I guess it was made fairly easy for them to get away. 
-So yes, it was another conspiracy, but you’ve disappointed me Mitchell, you are not listening very carefully. This happened seventy seven, on the calle Atocha. Where did you see our friend again?
-Outside the station. Atocha station in the square, where he was making the salute. You think he planted the bombs?
-It doesn’t work that way anymore. You don’t need to plant your own bombs; there’s plenty of idiots queuing up to do the job for you: and generally speaking they are happy to blow themselves up in the process, which is convenient in the way of not leaving much evidence. All you have to do is make it easy for them. 
-The bombs were on the train before they set off for Atocha remember. Our friend couldn’t have planted them; but he and his friends could easily have helped the people who did to plan, to get the materials and so on. It seems that the bombers would have needed quite a lot of help; they were such a bunch of amateurs. It was a gang of Moroccans running a mobile phone shop. They used their own phones to detonate the bombs, making it easy enough to find them. Our friend was probably watching to make sure they got on the right trains on the right day. 
-But to continue, you’ve been living here, so you know all the fuss it caused, three days before the election, both main parties accusing each other of lying about it. The government claimed it was ETA, the evidence pointed to Islamists. Now the left says the right lied to win the election, and the right says the left stole the election by making everyone terrified of Al Qaeda.
-Well our friend, when he was in his foaming and ranting phase, talking about sacred missions and old betrayals, he just didn’t see any difference between right and left in the main parties. He said he wanted to see the back of them and of all the other queers in the Cortes. It sounded like he hoped that the result of whatever he was planning would be for Spain to bomb Morocco back to the Stone Age, but he’d be content if the people took to the streets and beat some Arabs to death for starters. It’s the same basic idea, I’m afraid, the country descends into violence and chaos and then the strong men step in. The country’s grown beyond it you might think, but these people are depressingly short on imagination. 
-If what you say is right, then he must have been pretty disappointed. 
-Yes, it’s nice to think that, just occasionally, ordinary people can see that both sides are feeding them bullshit and decide to make up their own minds. Gives you some hope for the future in a generally disappointing world. Of course I have a hedge against that kind of disappointment, since my business tends to prosper most when people are intent on killing one another. It’s win win for me.
-Anyway, it’s obvious that all of this mess was not the work of one deranged police colonel who wanted to drive the Moors out of Christendom. And you might show a little more interest; given this has a personal bearing on you. 
-I’ll go on, shall I? It turned out that two of the bombers were on the police payroll as informers. When you look closely, you see other black ops signs. One of the bombs fails to blow up because it’s not connected, and the trail leads so clearly back to the Moroccans that even Inspector Clouseau could have tracked them down and made the arrest. The bombs turn out to be made from local dynamite which was obviously the best our man could do. It checks back to some Madrid gang who use it for blowing safes or fishing, who knows. Certainly there was no reason for the gang to draw attention to themselves by helping radical Muslims to make bombs. They only want to be left alone to do crime. But it would be easy for certain people to twist their arms up their backs to help. It’s supposed to look like ETA and to look like Jihad as well, you see. Maybe at a stretch you can even argue that the two are in league. It’s about creating confusion and panic, and distrust. 
-So the government first claims the separatists are responsible, and after they lose the election they destroy all the records in the files. They even wipe the electronic data and leave the bill for the job behind for the new lot, who claim that this proves they knew it wasn’t separatists and chose to lie. I think it’s more likely they just realized, too late, that they’d been had, and wiped the records to cover their embarrassment. 
They drove on without speaking for some time. Finally Mitchell spoke, sullenly.
-You haven’t explained why any of that puts me here.
-You were unlucky enough to see our friend at the scene of the crime, out of uniform, probably off duty, but certainly where he was not supposed to be. Very difficult to explain and if you were persuaded to remember when you and I first met him, that would create complications for me, but also for some important people who know me.
-They might be more worried about you than about me.
-That’s possible, but I don’t have your unfortunate knack of turning up in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
The car stopped.
-We’re here. Get out.
Outside, the afternoon was shading to evening. The air was very still. The road was deserted. It ran straight along a little ridge for a way before dipping out of sight. To their right the land fell away into steep, thickly wooded ravine.
-I don’t want to get out. I know what happens next.
-You certainly know what happens next if you don’t do as I tell you. 
Walcott exited the car, as commanded. He had to lean on the door, not able to trust his shaking legs. Ray held the gun in his pocket, not pointing it anywhere in particular. He motioned for Walcott to get off the road. They walked a little way down a rough track that led into the trees: Walcott had to go first. Then Ray commanded him to stop. 
-By the way, he remarked conversationally. I tracked down our friend the policeman. He was well. Seemed in good spirits. Wasn’t put out about seeing me at all. Said he expected I would be meeting with you in the not too distant future. Sit down on that rock a moment, you look like you’re about to fall over. 
Walcott half collapsed onto the boulder, but he could not turn his eyes away from Ray’s. 
-I did ask him about some of these crazy ideas I’ve been having, just out of curiosity. He couldn’t stop himself confirming most of what I told you. Not really a professional you see; too much pride and passion – an enthusiast. He was right though, he did his part even a little too efficiently, and the boys weren’t as useless as he feared when it came to actually blowing things up. Regrettable loss of life, he said, but that is the nature of war: the priority must always be to achieve the objective. I said I understood completely; then I shot him four times in the back of the head. I never liked policemen and the fascist ones are worse. 
-So now all that links me to any of this is you. And I have a theory about you?
-What theory?
My theory about you, I’ve told you before, is that you’re harmless and good at forgetting. You’ve done it before, remember?
-I forget
-That’s the spirit. But do remember this: you’ve lived through enough parts of this story to see that it could have different endings. The happy one for you is where you follow this path down the hill, get in the old red Seat that fits these keys, pick up the pocket money that’s in the glove compartment, and drive to somewhere very quiet where no-one knows you and you’re never heard from again. And remember what I told you once before, friends who put you in situations like this are not your friends. 
Ray tossed the keys in Walcott’s direction. The other made a feeble reflex attempt to catch them. The keys fell to the ground in front of him.
-Will the car explode when I turn the key?
-Why would I waste a perfectly good Seat, when I could shoot you here? It’s high mileage but it runs fine. And I don’t like waste. Your idea is messy and stupid. Me giving you the car is better; another business expense. It’s deductible against something, though god knows what. But I have to say you’re trying my patience standing there arguing about it. Frankly at the moment you are proving to be a troublesome expense.
-Maybe you’ll shoot me in the back when I start walking down the path.
-Could be, but even though you seem to be a sleazy coward, I sort of like you, I don’t know why. People I like, I generally shoot in the front. And some important people want you dead, so maybe this is my statement for them. 
-What kind of statement?
-Think of it this way. I’m a soldier, not a murderer, and you’re very much a civilian. It’s an imaginary distinction, but I’m not so stupid I don’t know that a man has to invent a code and live by it. On the other hand I’ve got places to be. Watching you clinging to that rock like the world was spinning so fast you might fall off is starting to bore me. I think you’d be wise to piss off now before I change my mind.
-I’m leaving.
Hawkins stood unmoving in the blazing sunlight. He watched Walcott bend and reach for the set of keys he’d fumbled and finally drag himself upright. Ray smiled as Walcott stumbled away, never looking back; into the cool welcoming shadows between the trees.
